      "['[CLS] The hardest thing is on a day that you re bored. You notice at the most. But if you re just sitting there playing video games or just sitting there doing work or homework, you start to feel it. [SEP]', '[CLS] The more you think about it the more your head starts to hurt. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I used to get places minutes early so I could smoke one or two beforehand, sounds absolutely stupid but my timekeeping is absolutely terrible now, I'm constantly late for stuff. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Other than that, quitting cold turkey was easy, I didn't wait to finish a pack I think I had about cigs left in the pack when I decided I was done, if I'd finished the pack first I would have made excuses to keep smoking. If that made sense. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Not relapsing. Seems like the obvious answer but it's really hard not to relapse when your brain constantly tries to find excuses to smoke. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I just realized that smoking pork was way more delicious. Turkey doesnt hold the flavor from smoking the way that pork does. [SEP]', '[CLS] Pig meat is always best smoked. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Wasn't hard at all. My blood pressure was really bad so I didn't have a choice. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Probably the whole not smoking cigarettes part. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I've been a ex smoker for . years now. This week got quite bad where I almost started again. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] But knowing all the damage I'm doing, especially to my teeth has stopped me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] They tell you about cancer and lung disease but don't mention that the bone holding your teeth in with start to recead leading to tooth loss. [SEP]\", '[CLS] So basically, knowing I would lose my teeth stopped me. [SEP]', '[CLS] People. Other people are much harder to deal with when your brain is constantly seeking out ways to manipulate you into finding excuses to smoke again. [SEP]', '[CLS] Nah but seriously, it s aside from the sensation it s just having something to do. It seems like a very different experience walking down the road without a cig than with one. You re not speaking up, holding anything, flicking ash, bringing your hand up and down to your mouth. [SEP]', '[CLS] That s why vapes have been a godsend to me. I don t even need nicotine, it s just the sensation of the action I miss. [SEP]', \"[CLS] There's a couple things most people have trouble with when quitting that make it harder. First, you have to actually want to quit. I know from experience that many times I tried to quit I didn't want to quit, I was trying to quit because everyone was telling me to. Second, just because you stumble doesn't erase your progress. Smoking a cigarette after a couple days doesn't mean you've failed, we're fallible. Don't throw your hands up and give up because you fell to temptation. Continue trying. Addiction is a beast, but we're animals that thrive in adversity. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Someone I work with is trying to switch to a healthier lifestyle, had been trying for a long time before she realized that slipping up once doesn't erase all the progress you've made. Same thing I had to learn when I tried to go a year without drinking. And this is probably the best advice for trying to overcome anything. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The part about slipping up is the real key. My wife and I quit or years ago I really can't remember exactly when. [SEP]\", '[CLS] We both went cold turkey. We do still pick up a pack of smokes if we are going out to drink and know we will be drunk. A night out heavily drinking which we only do once a month or every other month we might split a quarter pack and then just give the pack to one of our smoker friends when we leave. [SEP]', '[CLS] People always give us shit about killing our progress but whatever. It works for us and certainly beats a pack a day each. [SEP]', '[CLS] My biggest problem is that I want to quit, but I want to smoke. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I LOVE smoking. Reason It makes me feel good. I hate smoking, it tastes terrible, it makes me cough, it costs so much money, I am often smoking alone, outside in the cold nowdays. It fucking sucks. But it makes me feel good. It's so relaxing. A few hours without a cigarette is painful. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Addiction is more than a beast, it's a fucking monster. It warps your brain into loving the feeling of being gross. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I know it's gross, I know it's slowly killing me, I know it stinks, I know it costs me a lot of money but my brain doesn't care. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The way I see it My body tortures me when I deprive it of nicotine. So I smoke to feel normal, not because I want to feel the relaxing effect, but because that relaxing effect, is what normal used to be. [SEP]', '[CLS] I want to quit, but the hold it has on my body is greater because smoking makes me feel good. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Any tips for making yourself actually want to quit I know I need to, I just don't want to. I've even considered hypnosis. [SEP]\", '[CLS] you have to actually want to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Yeah, this. Quitting is easy. Wanting to quit is hard. I've quit like or times defined as no smoking for a week , but I always kinda want to smoke. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] So I just fell into this, accidentally quitting smoking because of a cracked rib. I think about a certain look on peoples' faces at AA meetings, the ones that said, I'm only doing this bullshit because I have to do this bullshit. It's the same thing. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] However, I've managed to stick with it because this isn't the first time I've quit, and something I noticed the last time I quit for about three years seems pretty important. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That feeling you get when you want to smoke a cigarette after you've quit smoking That twitchy, ancey, can't scratch that itch feeling It's the exact same feeling you get just before you light up a cigarette. In other words, you actually experience that addict's separation MORE AS A SMOKER than you do as one who has quit. After a couple of weeks the urges hit me only a few times a day instead of twenty, when I was actually smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It's still bullshit, though. I didn't want to quit and every single day I can think of good reasons to go back and enjoy myself. I think if I can stick with it another month or so I'll be fine. But I might say, fuck it, too, because I don't really want to quit. I'm only doing it because the opportunity arose and my conscience demands that I try it. I need a fucking blow job. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Yup. Smoked about a pack in total in the months after I quit. But haven't smoked in years now. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I second this completely. You have to want to. Like properly have to. No pretending to yourself. I smoked for ish years and knew I wanted to stop by the time I turned . I wanted to stop. It's almost a state of mind. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The first one is very true. I just don t have the motivation within myself to want to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Besides the health risks which feel so far away from me now since I m only in my s , I don t personally see why I should quit . [SEP]', \"[CLS] This advice is on point. I successfully quit cold turkey on the first try. Everyone asks me what my secret was and simply put, I allowed myself to cheat. If I was feeling really stressed or having a bad craving, I'd allow myself to have a cigarette. Eventually, I got to the point where I didn't get those cravings anymore. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I feel like there's a certain level of shame you have to hit before you can really commit to it. I was never a big smoker, but spent a long time as a can per day chewer. What compelled me to quit was something my pack per day neighbor said to me. We were out on our porches, he was smoking and I was chewing. He told me, seems like every time I see you there's something in your lip . Holy shit that hit me hard. My chain smoking neighbor notices my tobacco habit It must be bad. I was able to quit within a couple weeks of then and it's been almost years now. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Yes, and education re effects was helpful to me. [SEP]', '[CLS] you have to want to quit this is good for people to note. [SEP]', '[CLS] At the doctors office when the nurse confirms some stuff they ask about smoking. I usually lie because before theyd just say you should stop it s bad for you . [SEP]', '[CLS] Last time I didn t lie and I was surprised when she said when you re ready to quit we can help. [SEP]', '[CLS] First, you have to actually want to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My mother successfully quit after smoking for years and said this exact thing. She said the times she had tried in the past, she didn't really want to. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Absolutely this. I can't recall how many times I started again because I had a couple smokes and felt like I failed at quitting. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The other thing this helped with is that previously when I quit it felt like I would Never smoke again, and I hated the forever not being able to do something I enjoy thought. Just take it one day at a time if you break down and smoke just enjoy it and go back to quitting the next day. You didn't fail, you just took a break. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] so many people are like it'd be cool if i didnt smoke it'd save me money and blah blah blah thats not enough to quit. You have to actually want to quit knowing that you are wasting money and damaging your health not that just oh itd be cool if i didnt smoke, thats not enough motivation and THATS why people fail at quitting. You have to want it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is it. You have to really want to quit. Not for anyone else but for yourself. I smoked for years. I tried to quit and failed a few times. It wasn't until I was so sick of being sick all the time that I was finally able to kick the habit. I was sick with a bad head cold I used to get those a lot when i smoked and then i just stayed in bed for a whole weekend. It sucked and I thought I was going to die but by the time Monday came around I was sure I could keep it up. It's been a year and a half and I haven't smoked once since that weekend. Sure some times I get a craving but I don't really want to start again. I feel so much better now. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I can second that you have to want it. You are never going to kick the habit until you yourself decide you want to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I tried everything in the book, and what finally made me give it up once and for all was because I was about to spend a large chunk of money on a new car and didn't want to ruin it with cigarette smoke and burns. You sometimes find motivation is some really strange places. [SEP]\", '[CLS] First, you have to actually want to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I can't stress this one enough. Seriously, this is your biggest stumbling block. You have to want it. Seriously want it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I tried quitting many times, for my health, for my girlfriend, for convience no matter what reason i had, no matter what plan I had, whether cold turkey, gum, the patch, whatever it always ended up in failure. [SEP]', \"[CLS] One day, i realized just how much money I was spending, and just said fuck it, I don't want to do this anymore . I seriously wanted to quit. And, it was fairly easy. I got on the patch for months, and after that, I've been tobacco free for around years now. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I don t even smoke but this motivated me to stop smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] so true, if you even have questions about whether you want to or not, youll fail. [SEP]', \"[CLS] To add to that what helped me was puffing without inhaling. I quit because I wanted to get life insurance and they do a urine test for drugs and cigarettes. No point paying more my whole life for it. Got some test kits to check myself on Amazon and figured after i get the insurance I can start again. Well after . weeks of mostly cold turkey it became hard to inhale the random cigarette whichout feeling sick. So I would puff but not inhale. Took about months of this random puffing cig game till i no longer even craved one. In fact it now smells bad to me times. After months by the way it was flushed out and I was able to take get life insurance for a fraction of the cost. I'll save about , over the course of the policy. [SEP]\", '[CLS] No point picking it up again now as cravings are gone. Only thing I miss is taking breaks during hour work marathon and planning my next steps. Need an hourglass or something. [SEP]', '[CLS] What you say is very true. I would like to add that cravings are temporary. And as you get past a craving, they get shorter with more time between cravings. So each craving you beat makes it just a bit easier. [SEP]', '[CLS] Never give up. Forgive yourself and try again. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This is pretty much what I came to say. I think by far the most important thing, and the thing that stops most people, is number one. Or at least it was for me. I smoked for years and tried to quit several times. Longest I made it was months then I went on a cruise and bam, right back to . packs a day I tried e cigs but it was really not the same thing. I enjoyed smoking and even though I thought I should quit I really didn't want to. Not really deep down inside. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Finally around I just got fed up with spending so much money to stink all the damn time and I just quit. Haven't had a cigarette since. It wasn't easy. The cravings were difficult. It was a really strange time honestly but they only lasted a few months and then I was mostly fine. I still want a cigarette every now and then but it's more like an impulse, just a thought that pops into my mind, than a physical craving. I even dream of smoking sometimes lol. I'm happy that I quite though for sure. [SEP]\", '[CLS] So, how do you know when you want to quit and when someone else is influencing you to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Smoking a cigarette after a couple days doesn't mean you've failed, we're fallible. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Ultimately, I've also came to the conclusion, that self flagellation doesn't change much at the end of the day. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Respectfully, I kinda disagree with the smoking a cig after trying to quit. As a former smoker myself whom also attempted to quit several times, you need to make up your mind. Are you a smoker or not Then stay strong if you decide it's time that quit. Cold turkey is the only way to truly quit. If you have a cig while trying to quit you've just reset the clock from your last smoke and you'll have to rego the withdrawal all over again. My best advice is to get something to keep you busy. Smoking is not only a chemical dependency but also an physical or oral fixation. I quit with the help of a very big bag of butter rum lifesavers. Decision is yours in the end, are you going to be a smoker or are you going to be a former smoker. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Brush your teeth after every meal or cup of coffee. For me, the taste of food or coffee in my mouth would trigger the need for a cigarette. [SEP]', \"[CLS] It's not good for your teeth to brush them too often, but it's worth doing it during the first two weeks. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That honestly sounds like a solid strategy for me. I always long for a cigarette after I've eaten. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Not only not good to brush often, but brushing after an acidic drink, particularly coffee, will rub off the enamel which is irreplaceable. This is only an issue for minutes post your last drink, and using a soft brush head helps with enamel loss. [SEP]', '[CLS] I m pretty sure smoking is worse for your teeth than brushing too often. [SEP]', '[CLS] Brush lightly for only a minute using a soft bristle brush. No harm done. [SEP]', '[CLS] I used this technique but with mouth wash as it was easier to carry around with me. [SEP]', '[CLS] Taste of food in my mouth triggers the need for more food for me lol. [SEP]', '[CLS] Can you enlighten me why it s not good to brush your teeth too often If it helped someone quit smoking for a year wouldn t brushing your teeth more often be healthier than smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] So this might work great for a couple days, and then when your out with your friends having a few drinks or you're late coming home from work and grab a snack at the train station suddenly you get the nicotine shivers and bam you're back to smoking  . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Oooo, that's a good catch. Coffee still imprinted with cigarettes for me. [SEP]\", '[CLS] You could just brush your tongue instead. [SEP]', '[CLS] As a guy quitting smoking weed, thank you for actual helpful advice that I haven t heard anywhere yet. After dinner is the biggest struggle. [SEP]', '[CLS] Exercise and sunflower seeds did it for me. Smoke free since. [SEP]', '[CLS] So do you grind them up before you smoke them or what. [SEP]', '[CLS] Fox Mulder Is that you. [SEP]', '[CLS] for Sunflower seeds. I did that as well. Started the exercise bit later. yrs now. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Congratulations, I use to smoke quite often but now i've dialed it down a decent amount although how do you escape the constant lure and pull especially when mates are smoking around you. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Sunflower seeds are as addictive as hell. [SEP]', \"[CLS] How do you exercise. I'm guessing you skulk around at night with a revolver hunting lizards. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Mr Sir is that you. [SEP]', '[CLS] for me. Especially when driving. [SEP]', '[CLS] Lower the window spit seeds out  I used to drive hours for my job constantly. This is how I finally quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] I uses snus Gum etc at first to wean off nicotine  but seeds were my long term habitual helper I could have anywhere. [SEP]', '[CLS] The only thing that trapped me for awhile was social events and social anxiety. A smoke used to be my escape when my anxiety raised. I realized that I could just say I needed to make a call or needed some air  but it took time. [SEP]', '[CLS] I am currently unable to quit. I just wanted to say congratulations and good advice. [SEP]', '[CLS] This guy read holes and took it to heart. [SEP]', '[CLS] There is an emergency bag of seeds in my glove compartment at all times. [SEP]', '[CLS] Exactly what I did. Going on a month strong. [SEP]', '[CLS] Well, well, well if it isn t the Reddit user with half my power. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same Exact program for me. Lots of running. [SEP]', '[CLS] I also used sunflower seeds, i still occassionally blow through a bag. [SEP]', '[CLS] For real, exercise would give me a headrush on par or at least close to a cigarette. [SEP]', '[CLS] sun flower seeds i remember eatting those seeds as a kid. eat too many and your lips will be dried ass hell. proarably all the salt they put on the seeds. [SEP]', '[CLS] Congrats dude Unrelated but I ve been vomit free since . [SEP]', '[CLS] A pack of sunflower seeds a day. Keep that mouth busy. [SEP]', '[CLS] Joe scott is that you. [SEP]', '[CLS] this dude in one of my classes is always chewing sunflower seeds. professor always makes fun of him. [SEP]', '[CLS] Former dip user here. Sunflower seeds and gum did it for me as well. [SEP]', '[CLS] I still tuck chewing gum under my bottom lip. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I too quit doing the same thing. The only time I didn't feel like a cig was after a big workout, so I worked out all of the time. The seeds just help pass the time. [SEP]\", '[CLS] for sunflower seeds. Keeps your mouth fixated, and becomes a new addiction that is much easier to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Sunflower seed effectiveness if you're a slav. [SEP]\", '[CLS] years earlier and you could ve made it rhyme. Congrats regardless. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same here, but youve got me by a year. [SEP]', '[CLS] sunflower seeds are a great help I also started collecting these crazy sideshow collectible statues with some of the money I saved, to visualize how much I was actually spending. Now I have a pretty stellar collection. [SEP]', '[CLS] My child asked me to stop because he was genuinely worried for my health. That look on his face as he begged me was l I needed. I went cold turkey and haven t slipped up in four years this month. [SEP]', '[CLS] couldnt sleep when i was a kid. came down crying to my dear fat her begging him to stop for so many nights. he looked me in the eyes and promised he would stop eventually. years later, he hasnt stopped and now i stopped caring. [SEP]', '[CLS] My sisters and I tried doing that with our mom about her cigarettes and her drinking, she just got mad and left probably to go smoke the stress away. [SEP]', '[CLS] I asked my mom to stop smoking about years ago now. And she did. [SEP]', '[CLS] Yeah, I had to have a conversation with my son because his slightly older cousin had told him smoking is really bad and kills you, and he was really upset, not wanting to believe her. [SEP]', \"[CLS] As much as you might justify continuing smoking to yourself, trying to put that justification into words whilst explaining the harm it does just doesn't work, and serves as a kick up the arse. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Not nearly as far down the line as you though, I'm about months in, vaping only although I started, indavertantly, with a massive drop in nicotine so had some heavy withdrawls. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I tried this so many times with my parents but their addiction just wouldn t let them stop. My dad died from a smoking related condition and my mum just puffs on in full denial. [SEP]', '[CLS] I stopped because I found out I was pregnant. Giving up coffee was harder than cigarettes just thinking of what one could do to my unborn child. I recently had her and have had zero desire to smoke one. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I read somewhere that cold turkey is really the only effective way. Personally, I've tried tapering off and it didn't work for me at all because the cigarettes are still always there and I just couldn't stop myself from teaching for one, although it did help me cut back a bit. I did the cold turkey thing too and a stuck for a little bit, but stress got me right back on the wagon or off I'm not really sure how the wagon works . I switched to a vape though and its helped my lungs. I keep telling myself that I'll quit but truthfully I'm afraid of what other vice I may pick up to replace it. Good for you though It's not an easy thing to do. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Same thing for me except it was my now wife. She cried about me possibly dying early and having to live on without me. Really tore me up. years cig free. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Kids are a great motivation to stop smoking. My brother stopped daily smoking when he got his new girlfriend because she hated it. He would still smoke a lot at parties and some here and there. Hasn't smoked since my niece was born. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I've lost a lot of family members to cancer, particularly lung cancer, it's a terrible way to go and as everyone is standing around them dying, it's gut wrenching to see the look of blame on their face, knowing it was their fault for smoking. I'm currently months without one, vaping helped me quit easily avoiding and not going to bars drinking. As much as everyone talks shit about the Jul vape, it literally helped me quit smoking so easily and then it's just a matter of not vaping, which is a hell of a lot easier than not smoking imo. [SEP]\", '[CLS] My dad chewed tobacco for more than years. All it took for him to quit was my little brother asking him to stop. My little brother was younger than years old and my older brother, sister and myself never asked him to stop. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I've been asking my mom to stop since I was . I'm almost now. Still waiting. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This is exactly what happened to me. [SEP]', '[CLS] year olds can be brutally honest. [SEP]', '[CLS] My mom never stopped telling me how I was a selfish little bitch for wanting to take smoking away from her. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Wish my dad would listen I've begged so many times.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] i quit when my first was born, he's now. It sucks at first obviously but now I find it really offensive when I smell. Ive tried one here and there and cant even finish it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] There's no tricks, just stop and accept the fact that it going to suck. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Lol, I tried this for years with my mom, she still smokes. [SEP]', \"[CLS] As a child I used to break my father cigarettes. He would leave and return with a fresh pack. Thanks to my studies in the rd grade I knew that cigarettes were awful for you. I would break roughly of them. I felt bad breaking them because I ended up costing him money but at the same time I didn't want him smoking. [SEP]\", '[CLS] But that would mean I would have to have a child  And start Smoking . [SEP]', '[CLS] My daughter put up post it notes Stop Smoking Go talk to your doctor Currently on Chantix and doing pretty well. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That's how me and my sister got my mom to stop smoking. When we were little we were scared she would die because of what we learned about smoking in school. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I started doing that to my parents as soon as I could form sentences. They never quit. Dad died at and mom at . Dad didn't last till my college graduation and neither of them made it to my wedding. Tell your kid he's lucky. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I got my Aunt to stop smoking when I was younger because I said she stunk when I went to sit on her lap oh, child honesty . She quit that day. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Apparently I said the same thing to my uncle too. He didn't care as much, still smokes. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I remember learning about tobacco and alcohol in elementary school. rd grade or so. I came home absolutely freaking out because my parents smoked cigarettes IN THE HOUSE, directly next to me and my little brother all the time since we were born. My dad also always had a beer in his hand. [SEP]', '[CLS] They basically told me to shut up and get over it. That adults can do what they want. We continued that unit and school and that whole week I remember being an absolute wreck and fearing for their lives haha. I remember an instance where I raised my hand in class and told the teacher that I asked my parents to stop and told him and the what they said. The teacher really didn t say anything and no one played with me at recess that day because my parents are gross . [SEP]', '[CLS] You re a good dad. Thank you for doing this for your kiddo. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My dad quit for years and has been caught multiple times by myself, my mom, and my sister and even after watching us sob and beg him to quit, he's still doing it. We don't know what to do to get him to stop. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] His smoking put him in the hospital recently and the doctors are honestly surprised he hasn't died yet. [SEP]\", '[CLS] You are stronger than my mother. Both her kids did that at separate times and she still smokes. [SEP]', '[CLS] My dad told me to stop being a bitch. [SEP]', '[CLS] i cried and cried and cried when i found out my dad smoked. he took his last cigarette out of the box and wrote the date on it as a promise he would stop. that little fucker didn t.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] When my twin and I were and my older brother was , we asked our parents to stop because we didn't like it. They did. Amazing. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Mom had smoked a pack of normal cigarettes a day and dad smoked two packs of unfiltered Camels a day. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I think I remember my older brother orchestrating the whole thing, but I'm super glad he did. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Good for fucking you. Seriously. You must be a great parent. [SEP]', '[CLS] My mother has said that she wants to stop but I ve never actually seen her do it. I do think that me developing asthma do to it was a wake up call to her however. [SEP]', '[CLS] The love of my life asked me to quit so that we could spend more time together. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My year old told me he thought my smokes were so cool fire and all and he couldn't wait until he got big just so he could smoke. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I threw them away then and there. I have had a few since but never gave up due to a slip up on my end. [SEP]', '[CLS] Fuck man this one hit hard. I haven t thought of this in years. I remember making a poster for my mom asking her to quit. My brother told me it would make her sad so I never showed her and never asked her to quit. She wilted away, fell to the rot of cancer then remission for one day. One day. One day of remission. One day free from oncoming death. On the way to eat at a Mexican joint that s no longer there. Mom is talking oddly. We sit down. With out a moment the fumbling of crying scared and running year old boy pleading for a doctor a brother in shock and a father crying and doing his best to help my mother. A Grand mal seizure that would end up boiling her mind to nothing. The cancer had spread to her brain. She died that day. Not her body that would take time. But her, mom she died. One day. We never heard her voice again not a word. Too Ra loo Ra loo that sweet song I sing to my son is the only memory I have of her voice. Did she even know We knew. What if What if I had showed her my poster. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Good for you, I went cold turkey years ago. I've always felt that anything else is just substituting one habit for another. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It's a mental game. You have to want to quit. By the end of my time as a smoker, I hated it. The way I smelled, hacking in the middle of the night, winded going up stairs, doctor's appointments were shameful. I got fed up and just stopped one day. Stopping isn't hard, sustaining is. Every time I thought about smoking, I thought about how disappointing it would be to go back to day . Smoke free since January . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I think this is exactly it. You can use tools to help, but if you don't actually want to quit, you aren't going to quit. Any time someone says I am going to try to quit , I already know they will fail. If they really wanted to quit, try wouldn't even be in that sentence. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I agree with your second part too. One drag puts you back at , the idea of that definitely helps you stay smoke free. [SEP]', \"[CLS] How long into the quitting do you notice that it's getting easier. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] How many a day did you smoke I've been smoking for years, now and I only really have a bit of a smoker's cough. Don't wake up hacking, don't get winded going up stairs though, I do a lot of labour for work so, that might help keep my lung capacity better. Maybe I just haven't smoked for long enough or, smokes a day isn't enough to cause those symptoms in years. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit smoking when I was out of town. Not beeing around those places I usually smoked at and the people I smoked with really helped since most of the addiction is routine imo. [SEP]', '[CLS] It definitely is routine. Part of my routine used to be starting the day off with a cup of coffee and cigarette. So I stopped drinking coffee and stopped smoking cigarettes Now I drink tea for my caffeine. [SEP]', '[CLS] I did one better. I actually quit right before moving. And then all my friends knew me as a nonsmoker, so nobody was ever asking me to go out and smoke with them. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Quit right before grad school, which sounds totally counterintuitive, but I was ready for the change. Sounded better than quitting DURING school, and since I didn't want to go over years as a smoker, quitting before sounded better. [SEP]\", '[CLS] That s exactly what my wife did three years ago We went to the nose of Iowa and hiked. She had her last cigarette when we got there and never turned back. [SEP]', '[CLS] Quitting smoking is not that hard. I ve done it five times this year alone. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Reminds me of the last time I've smoked a long time ago, damn it feels like an eternity since this morning. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That's part of it for me Set realistic goals. Nothing is more depressing than failing yourself over and over again. Nothing makes you need a smoke more than after you've failed to quit. Some people can quit cold turkey, some can't. I try to make it like a game, and now I smoke cigarettes a day, and only at work. That's a level of smoking I can work with until I'm ready to fully jump off. But once you can forgive yourself, it becomes less crippling. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Exactly. I quit about minutes ago and will probably quit again later on today. [SEP]', '[CLS] I quit this morning and then again about minutes ago. Feel like I ve got a few more in me today before I quit again tomorrow. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I've quit every Monday for the last four months. Those Friday night drinks get me every weekend. [SEP]\", '[CLS] You just need to quit smoking one more time than you quit quitting. [SEP]', '[CLS] I used to quit times per pack. [SEP]', \"[CLS] It doesn't seem that easy if you had to start again times. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Pffff amateur, already did it x times this week. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Stopping entirely just means quitting enough times that you spend more time smoke free than not. Not everyone quits cold turkey, and if you quit times this year and next year, you'll have made progress. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Someone can quit times a year, and that doesn't make them a failure, it just means they haven't hit the attempt that'll be successful yet. The more you try, the more chances you have to succeed. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Pretty sure you re still smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Those are rookie numbers  I've quit at least times today alone. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I can quit anytime I want  I just dont want to. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This is funny but was also the key for me to actually quit. I just kept on quitting until it stuck. I tried every nicotine replacement product known to man, as well as cold turkey but wasn't successful, until what felt like my th attempt.

He's quit smoking permanently and forever six times. [SEP]\", '[CLS] youre not a genius are u. [SEP]', '[CLS] How long did you smoke for. [SEP]', '[CLS] Yup, this. Made it really easy. Tobacco free since. [SEP]', '[CLS] Dont quit. Seriously. Start not smoking. That way each day is an achievement, not a sacrifice. You focus on what you gain, not what you gave up. [SEP]', '[CLS] I smoked for years and used chewing tobacco for and this is the best advice here. Chewing gum and weening off won t help if you can t do this. I was in the best shape of my life when I smoked but I feel a hell of a lot better now that I ve started to not smoke. I haven t touched a cigarette or dip in years and I ll never go back. I ve even started to smoke cigars every now and then without a problem of quitting or anything. It is a mental state. [SEP]', '[CLS] Smoke free for days now. I really like this way of looking at it. Thanks. [SEP]', \"[CLS] You have to fucking endure it and realise that by quitting you are quite literally saving your own life. This shit will kill you and it will hurt the entire time you're dying. You need to just fucking stick with it, replace the cravings and endure that shit like you're playing a game of dark souls. Only you have to win, because if you fuck up, you'll die. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Enduring is the key, people will always be looking for the magical solution but it's really just down to how long you can not use mental gymnastics to justify smoking again. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It has to be hard to be worth it and if you're not struggling like a fish out of water then it's not working. imo. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The thing, enduring is hard. So fucking hard. I quit smoking for four years. I thought the urge would fade away. It did not. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Every day, for four years, I wanted to smoke. I'm back on a pack a day right now. I now quitting would be what's best for me, but I don't want to feel that need everyday again. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This is the only real advice, go about it however you need to, but you re literally saving your own life. It s not a matter of if, but when. [SEP]', '[CLS] Watching my wife s grandpa die from lung cancer got me to quit. My wife was pregnant with our first kid so she had already quit.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] I see this a lot. What's in this book that's so fucking magical. [SEP]\", '[CLS] So much this. Smoked for years, more than a pack a day and stopped over night just over years ago. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Won't recommend to any ex smoker, but that book even enabled me to be a party smoker I can smoke half a pack on a metal gig getting drunk, and have no desire to smoke again the next day. I do this about once every months and am amazed I never fall back  YMMV. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That book that is so good at getting you to quit, you can't even finish reading it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The Easy Way to Stop Smoking is actually the name of the book. It is fantastic and worked for me too. It puts you in the proper mindset. Quitting gives the connotation that you are sacrificing something good when clearly you are not, a key point in the book. [SEP]', '[CLS] This book was great for me, I recommend it to anybody who wants to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Quit smoking a few months ago thanks to The Easy Way to Quit Smoking. Smoked for nearly years, always wanted to quit but never succeeded until I read the book. Do it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same here, but the video. [SEP]', '[CLS] Edit sorry mates, I have no link for the video. It s probably been years since I ve seen it. Tried looking for it on YT but I couldn t see it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I've heard this from so many people. They read the book in one sitting and never lit another cigarette. I wish there was a book that would do the same for procrastination, overeating, anxiety . [SEP]\", '[CLS] Is it Allen or Aaron Can t seem to find Aaron Carr. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Thank you for this. I just ordered a used copy on eBay. This will be attempt number for me. My grandmother quit when she was in her 's and my mother who is just quit because of bronchitis and hasn't smoked in almost a month. I've seen the effects of long term smoking and I don't want that, plus I have a year old daughter and my girlfriend has daughter's as well. I'm going to try this book, and anything else I can find to stop, permanently. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I read this book to and I feel it helped me quit. I read it a couple of more times whenever I started smoking again, and I really think it helped to quit, but I never felt disheartened because I'd stated again. I knew quitting again would be a choir but I still had that book. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] So, I read that book in an attempt to find some angle of attack to get my dad to quit, but the book just basically says to think of yourself as a nonsmoker and just do nonsmoker things. Other than that, it's just a motivational book with stories about the author who quit smoking and why his life is better without it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Am I missing the point because I've never smoked and therefore never understood the addiction. [SEP]\", '[CLS] worked for me too smokefree since. [SEP]', '[CLS] Yup, that story he tells about making a boat turn back because he forgot his smokes but then not smoking any out of shame really hit me. [SEP]', '[CLS] I have to add my voice to the choir recommending this book. It really works. It manages it take away almost every excuse you can think of to keep yourself smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Years ago I decided to quit. I'd gone several days without smoking nearly at all but I kept having a late night smoke that didn't count if I didn't inhale . After a few days of feeling like a failure I googled a bit and bought the ebook that night. It was the first night I went without smoking which turned into the first full day, and so on and so forth. I kept reading until my understanding of the addiction shifted to the point that I truly knew that I never wanted or needed to smoke again. I don't even think I finished the book either. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I bought a hard copy soon thereafter because I wanted to pass this along. My husband quit shortly after me using a combo of the book and the patch. We then gave the book to my parents. with the acknowledgement that we didn't expect them to quit. That it had to be on their terms. But if they ever thought they were ready, to read the book in case it could help them too. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Within the next year my mom and dad had both quit. They were lifelong smokers with years of experience who had tried quitting many times before and this book managed to help them where so many other methods failed. [SEP]', \"[CLS] It's been years now and I think my mom is still alive solely because she quit. That book saved her life. Now my mom still says she quit just so she could stop reading the damn book. I don't care. I'm just glad she's here to do the complaining. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This needs to be up at the top. This is a proven method which is not only piss easy, it does not require any gimmicks. No chewing gum endlessly, sunflower seeds, no need for nicotine replacement therapy etc. I understand people being sceptical, I am the biggest sceptic out there but after reading this book, it changed my life forever. I won't lie to you, I have smoked after reading the book and quitting. The trigger for this was alcohol which you should steer clear from for the first few months ideally but nonetheless thanks to the book when the inevitable cravings do come I don't give in and buy a pack, I understand them for what they are and ignore them, happy to be a non smoker. That's the power of this book, cannot recommend enough. [SEP]\", '[CLS] What is it about the book that can cause so many to stop smoking Is it a nicotine laced book. [SEP]', '[CLS] Read the book but for some reason it was the audiobook that made me really quit. It s on audible. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I recommend this to every one that is trying to quit or mentions wanting to. It'll be a year for me in a few weeks. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It works amazingly well, only stipulation is you have to go into it already wanting to quit. Someone suggested it to me many years ago and I only read it out of curiosity. It motivated me to give it a shot but just didn't give enough effort. The important thing though was it planted the seed. I knew that when I was really ready to quit I'd go back to the book. Sure enough when the time came that I made up my mind and that was it went back, read it again, and never looked back. Cold turkey. [SEP]\", '[CLS] When you decide you re going to buy your last pack, find a mason jar to put all those cigarette butts out in. Then when your pack is empty and the jar is full of cigarette butts and ash, fill it with water just enough so they re all submerged.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] Eh, that's pretty much what my whole apartment smelled like. Glad it worked for you though. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Honestly Cold Turkey. Bite the bullet, suffer for the week and you will be good. [SEP]', '[CLS] I quit almost months ago, had last cig Sunday night, threw papers and filter in the bin and that was it. It was hard, fucking hard but get past days and you will be good. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This is what I did, over years ago now. I wanted to stop because I'd just had a cold with a very sore throat and smoking was hell and made me feel worse. I'd recently read that the worst bit was the first days and I felt I could power through that. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Not only did I manage to power through those few days it was for me but afterwards it got so much easier. At that point it was more about breaking the habit rather than the pysical withdrawal. Maybe I'm lucky but I didn't get any urge to smoke after the first couple of weeks when I was used to not lighting up any more. [SEP]\", '[CLS] For me, I was telling myself I d quit every time I bought a pack for about a month, and one day after buying a pack I mustered up the courage to smoke a couple, then break the rest of my pack in half and throw them away. Haven t touched one since. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Same here. Cold turkey and stayed away from triggers for a month. That was eight years ago and haven't touched one again. Did have a few nightmares where I woke up in a sweat thinking I had relapsed. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I told myself a year in advance that I was gonna quit smoking. That way I had an entire year to mentally prepare for it. Idk if this is actually a good tip or not but it worked perfectly for me. Haven t touched a cigarette since December , . [SEP]', \"[CLS] Just take a week off work when you do it. No need to lose your job over being an asshole while you're working on it. Best decision of my life. Also get a tracker to keep count of money saved, time saved, cigarettes smoked etc. I use Cessation Nation to this day. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I quit five months ago, the day I graduated college, and haven't looked back, other than for the first week. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The first time I quit, for months, I was driving and just compulsively threw my half pack of cigarettes out the window. [SEP]', '[CLS] Looking back I wish I didnt litter, though. [SEP]', '[CLS] I actually found it more difficult the second week after quitting. The first week you are still motivated. The second week is when you are creating a new routine and your entire body is fucked up. After week was so much better. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Chantix did it for me. Felt like cheating, but I couldn't have done it without the stuff. [SEP]\", '[CLS] There s no such thing as cheating when it comes to quitting. [SEP]', '[CLS] Fight as dirty as you can. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I'm currently on chantix now. I'm days smoke free and going strong. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I used Chantix too. It gave me crazy nightmares though. [SEP]', '[CLS] This. Started taking it and, one day, just didn t really have the craving. It was pretty amazing. Make sure you finish the cycle it s like eight weeks or something . [SEP]', '[CLS] Chewed a fair amount of gum for another few months after. [SEP]', '[CLS] I did this as well and I highly recommend it. Took the pain out of quitting and made it easy. I tried quitting so many times only to eventually fail. Tried campix once and have been smoke free for years now. I also liked the vivid dreams. [SEP]', '[CLS] Chantix was how my husband and I both quit. I quit within weeks, and my husband within days. [SEP]', '[CLS] I had used patches, tried cold turkey, but kept going back to smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] Got rx for chantix from my Dr. Had an event coming up where I knew the urge to smoke was gonna be really high, so delayed the start of taking the chantix till after that event. [SEP]', '[CLS] After a few weeks I got up one morning, went to have my morning smoke, took one drag and realized it tasted really bad Tossed it and have not light up since. That was around years ago. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Same. Taking chantix took my craving thoughts from fuck it you've smoked for so long you're gonna get cancer anyway might as well enjoy yourself to well I sure would like one but I shouldn't . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Once the cravings got to that level my sincere desire to quit and significantly changing my routine so I could develop new habits that didn't involve smoking got me over the finish line. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Granted this was months ago, and I still occasionally slip up and have a couple, but I haven't had a smoke in the morning, while at work, etc, in that whole time. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Chantix is fucking amazing and this should really have more upvotes. I took chantix and just kept smoking like normal until one day I was just like, I don't want this. A few weeks later I was like damn I really want a cigarette so I went out and bought a pack, took two puffs off that first cigarette and was like nope, I actually don't want this . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I did eventually start smoking again much later on and was too lazy embarrassed to ask for Chantix from my doctor. So I switched to vaping. My wife wants me to quit that too though, so I finally went and got Chantix again. The really odd thing is it didn't help me with vaping at all. Was so surprising. I still vape, but no cigarettes at least. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Okay so I ve heard great things about Chantix and not so great things. The great thing is that it actually takes away the urge to smoke. The not so great thing crazy night terrors that seriously fuck with you. Did you experience any of that. [SEP]', '[CLS] Chantic made me not want to smoke but also turned me batshit crazy. [SEP]', '[CLS] I took Chantix and read the book recommended above Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr . Chantix helped me through the first week or so after the first week where you continue smoking while taking Chantix . Anyone thinking about using it, make sure you follow the instructions and eat regular meals. At that time I would usually only eat once a day midday and my stomach would be killing me around midnight until I ate something. Like actual pain, not hunger pains or feeling sick or something. [SEP]', '[CLS] I tried quitting with Chantix twice and had the same issue both times, so I know that was the culprit for sure. Second time I stopped taking the Chantix and used the motivation I gained from the book to finish quitting. Been . years now. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Chantix is the only thing that worked for me. I tried many methods and failed repeatedly. I've even had to do chantix multiple times but I feel confident I'm finally done. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'm months smoke free because of Chantix. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I didn't set a quit date, it just became obvious that the cigarettes tasted like shit and didn't give me the same fix anymore. I actually did not want them anymore. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I do believe that it pushed me into a bit of a depression, however, I had just started it a week before my mother passed, and then another series of fairly negative things happened, so I can't totally blame the Chantix. I will say that there were a few nights around week or so that I was just ridiculously angry that I COULDNT get a nicotine fix smoking wouldnt give me any relief. I learned that in the first week, though. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I've been off Chantix awhile now, and I get urges to smoke, sometimes interestingly it isnt after meals like before, its when Im really angry. But its easy to just ignore the urge, I mean, hell, Ive come this far. I'm certain I'm done. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It helped me too. I'd already tried quitting cold turkey a few years before, and made it a few months before stupidly starting again. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Comparing cold turkey to Chantix, I'd say Chantix was like skipping the first or weeks of withdrawal symptoms. Skipping the most intense part of it, but I still did kinda want to smoke sometimes, though I think that was just the psychological part at that point. But it was much easier to deal with the mental aspect having Chantix take the edge off the physical aspect. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I was lucky enough not to experience any side effects, at least not noticeably worse than the effects of quitting cold turkey. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I used champax which o assume is the same thing. Absolute miracle drug. I'd still be smoking now only for it. years now. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Vape. But not in an obnoxious force other people to walk through vanilla, banana, sundae vapour shit. Use it to have that hand to mouth action that is habitual. [SEP]', '[CLS] I quit cold turkey because I found out I was pregnant, but my husband quit this way. Just the habit of going outside was hard to break. So he would vape and I would eat one of those little dum dum suckers. Been smoke free for straight years now. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I'd rather walk through banana than tobacco smoke. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Agree, the Juul specifically is all that worked for me. Working on quitting that now. [SEP]', '[CLS] I quit last year with the help of a new gaping rig Get your hardware online but go to a shop for the juice, because everyone makes it slightly different and most places will let you try before you buy. [SEP]', '[CLS] I bought a disposable e cig today. I really have found I don t really crave nicotine, it s the act of smoking that s a habit. I had planned to buy a rechargeable e cig and a couple of weeks worth of juice but now I m optimistic that a week or so on the disposables might be enough to break the habit. [SEP]', '[CLS] In all honesty it is the nicotine dosage you are use to. Vapes e cigarettes let you control your dosage and you can decrease it gradually over time. Then when your down to mg or less, you start seeing less of a dependence on it. Eventually I just stopped all together within a year. Still vape during the cold months though, vape and coffee in the morning used to be cig and coffee . Honestly it changed everything. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This. Keep your wattage low on a stock piece of kit so you don't look like fog rolling in off the ocean. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Black Friday will mark two years since my last smoke and year since I stopped vaping. Picking a non tobacco flavor helped though as tobacco vape just tasted like nasty cheap cigarettes and made me want the real thing even more. [SEP]', '[CLS] Cigarettes have a ton of chemicals that your body becomes dependent on, quitting nicotine is like quitting coffee, you re gonna be aggravated and have cravings but it s manageable. Vape on the other hand is pretty much ingredients, the only addictive one is nicotine, the transition from cigs to vape isn t as difficult as quitting cold turkey but it s a different sensation and you still crave the cigs. But if you can switch to vape it s easier to quit, you can change your dosage down and do it at your own pace and it won t hurt your health as bad. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Yep, I was half pack a day for almost a decade. The trick if you really want vaping to stick is to go heavy dose and a good system for the start. It'll get you hooked harder on the vape for a while, but it's much easier to come down with weaker and weaker doses. Less than years later, I'm still always carrying it around, but it's mixed at a very low . mg nicotine, and I'm basically just working on kicking the routine now. Smoking after eating, during breaks, and while driving were always huge triggers, and that's hard to overcome. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Honestly this. I had no interest in quitting for the longest time until my friend started vaping and let me try some of his. Haven't even had the urge to pick up a cig since because the vape gives me the same satisfaction of hand to mouth like you said. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Two months smoke free, and not once has it ever felt like a battle. To anyone looking to quit I can't recommend it enough. [SEP]\", '[CLS] As a transition for smokers who lack resolve, a decent setup is the alternative to tobacco. [SEP]', '[CLS] For the cold Turkey types that hit a wall, A cheap disposable can get some over the hump. [SEP]', '[CLS] The Juul has helped me alot just with just going through the motions. [SEP]', '[CLS] Yup. Helped me out this year tremendously. Got to the point where I even grew tired of vaping. However, when I drink I now like to indulge in vaping as opposed to ciggarettes . But it truly did help. [SEP]', '[CLS] Yup. My wife got pregnant and she quit immediately. I vaped for a few months then quit that too. [SEP]', '[CLS] Particularly I found it easier to quit by slowly reducing the amount of nicotine in vape juice. After reducing to zero nicotine over the course of like two years , I slowly stopped craving the action and eventually stopped carrying it around. It s been over three years since then, and I don t even get tempted by cigarettes, vapes, or nicotine at all anymore. [SEP]', '[CLS] Also by working down the amount of nicotine, your body becomes more sensitive to smaller amounts. So when I did try a cigarette after quitting, it was so overwhelming, it made me sick and not want to finish it. [SEP]', '[CLS] This is how I quit. I was able to gradually reduce the nicotine level of the fluid and also reduce the frequency since I could just take a few hits when the urge came on but not have to smoke an entire cigarette. Eventually I reduced both the nicotine craving and the habit craving enough to be able to quite. Took me about months. [SEP]', '[CLS] This. Started this after two years of two packs a week and while it does cost more upfront, you do save money front less frequent trips to buy juices or coils. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Same. I just wanted to quit cigarettes, but the nicotine addiction itself isn't such an issue to me. I just use the small pen like e cigarettes with a menthol liquid I don't like all the flavoured stuff and it doesn't produce much steam or a scent. People sometimes comment that it smells quite nice, if anything. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I might deal with the nicotine addiction itself someday by weaning myself down to weaker liquids. But for now I'm happy with the vaping, I enjoy it and it has completely replaced smoking for me. I couldn't smoke a real cigarette anymore, they smell awful to me now. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I do remember when I made the switch from cigarettes to vaping that there was an immediate change in how I felt. I stopped coughing, I felt more energetic, things tasted better, my fingernails went from blue to a nice healthy pink  whatever vaping is for me, it's a hell of a lot healthier than smoking cigarettes and for now, I'm happy with that. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I did it this way. I got the vape oils where you could gradually reduce the amount of nicotine. Started with two weeks at a low mg lvl, then the next two weeks with the lowest possible option. After that, only oils with no nicotine. Used it often and I would usually pull it out before I thought cravings would come. Kinda worked to keep my mind off it and I would eventually realize I made another day without feeling too bad. [SEP]', '[CLS] After about weeks I realized the thing was nothing more than a pacifier and I put in a drawer. Been years. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The real fight doesn't begin until you are off nicotine completely. No chew, no gum, no patches, no vaping. All of them are better than smoking, so there is that ,but don't kid yourself nicotine is still your master. Source I smoked or more packs a day for about years. Quit a hundred times. Currently nicotine free for . years. Still want 'em. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Don't, it's not proven, but probably also very unhealthy. Just get over your urge to suck on things, you're not a baby anymore. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I went and saw a hypnotist. He also is an MD and a Chiropractor as well with a long history of practice in his medical profession. [SEP]', '[CLS] One session, walked out, never looked back. No withdrawals, anger issues etc that I had felt with on previous attempts to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] About a year later, smoked a cigarette with a friend, wanted to see if I would pick the habit back up, never had the urge to pick up the habit. [SEP]', '[CLS] The Docs perspective is that cigarettes are a coping mechanism, not a physical addiction, but a psychological one. [SEP]', '[CLS] Myself and now about people I have recommended to go, all cigarette free. He found something that seems to work well. [SEP]', '[CLS] Ok were you from and how can I find one. [SEP]', '[CLS] I mean, nicotine is quite literally one of the most addictive substances we can use. that doesnt negate the power of psychologically deciding to stop and believing you can do it that shit is just as powerful to us. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My parents smoked since before I was born, and a couple years ago they found out about some hypnotist who sells DVDs to quit smoking. They watched them and haven't had a cigarette since. Pretty wild. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I find it hard to believe that an MD is also a chiropractor . [SEP]', '[CLS] Yeah I have my doubts about his being an MD and chiropractor . [SEP]', '[CLS] But hows the sunken place. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I smoked half a cigar the othet day, and the high I got from it was akin to the feeling I get after finishing exercises for two hours. It's so intoxicating and scary that you could sink so easily. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Currently cutting down and managed to get down to per day. Using a vape to help with this. Current motivation is saving money for Christmas so hope I can stick at it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Try to avoid caffeine as much as possible, in the morning I would have an apple to wake me up using the natural sugar. Something to have a hand mouth interaction helped as well, I bought a non nicotine based e cigarette with a light up tip just for that more realistic look to my brain. Lastly I used some basic step nicotine patches. Hope these points help out, good luck with Christmas. [SEP]', '[CLS] Using a vape definitely helped me as well. Smoked a pack a day, went down to or a day and eventually just quit smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] You re doing great I quit in yes I am old . Life after cigs is much better. I have no helpful tips other than willpower. I just decided to quit and I did. It is something I had wanted to do for awhile. You got this. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I m right where you are. Vape and using an app to slowly cut down. Currently on a day. My motivation is coming from how much quicker my skin is healing. I open boxes all day so the skin around my nails was always fucked up. I now have cuticles again I know it's small, but having visual proof that my health is getting better is giving me a kick up the arse to keep going. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Best of luck to you I will say this, from my personal experience I wouldn't try cutting back or weaning off . I tried this the first time and it was hell. It's like slowly torturing yourself and it lifts up the cigs vape you do smoke on a pedestal. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Second time I quit cold turkey and haven't looked back been years . Honestly hours is all it really takes for the worst of it to be over, so remove all smoking accessories ashtrays, lighters, etc and just try to keep yourself busy with something you enjoy. It varies obviously from person to person but for me day wasn't bad, just cravings. Day was tough, irritable, couldn't sleep well, etc. Day things started to smooth out and by day I felt less irritable, was able to sleep normal, and only had cravings when I performed tasks I normally smoked afterwards. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The most surprising thing to me was the week AFTER I quit my appetite suddenly shot through the roof Seriously I always felt hungry and ended up snacking almost non stop during the day. So ya, you may gain a few pounds if that happens to you too but even that goes away after about a month or . [SEP]', \"[CLS] I'm completely on vape myself, but now I'm just addicted to that instead. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I can't recommend enough asking your doctor about Chantix. It worked wonders. The quitting process was actually effortless. I just didn't want them anymore. Simple as that. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Only reason I vape still is because Chantix seems to have no effect on it with me, which is unfortunate. Worked great though with cigarette smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I did that for a long time. This sounds a little out there, but in order to really quit I had to make peace with the fact that I can never have another cigarette. In unsuccessful attempts, I had it in the back of my mind that I could have or a day, or on special occasions. The truth is that I'll be right back where I started if I did that. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Sorry to say, but all it takes is discipline and resolve. The way it worked for me was that , I saw that my wife was feeling really nauseated. She wouldn't say anything, but I could see it in her face. I just had to stop hurting her. That, plus we were planning to start a family. Once those two things sunk in and I made my resolution, I never went back. I only tried to quit once, and that was it. Haven't smoked since . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I went cold turkey after I started smelling my hands and realized I had to vigorously rinse with soap and water just to get that disgusting smell off me. I didn't want my hands or clothes to smell like an ash tray anymore. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Yep it's one of those things with no real trick other than to just do it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Yep, similar story here. It was easy, once I had a reason to. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My friend male had a child and he just stopped smoking one day and never did it again. I'm not sure how he did it, but he doesn't talk about it. It was a really weird thing I was so used to him going outside for smokes and such. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I would probably smoke, but nicotine always gives me an 'impending doom' feeling for some reason. Unless I'm on amphetamines, then it feels really nice to smoke like water to a thirsty man. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This is how I quit as well. Just stopped buying cigarettes and haven t gone back. Yes it sucks and yes sometimes I want to smoke but knowing I just could but make the choice not to keeps me going. [SEP]', '[CLS] Similar here. Had a kid, switched to vaping for months, then just quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same thing here, i had tried and failed several times, then we got engaged and I had this horribly vivid day dream of getting emphysema or COPD or lung cancer and becoming a burden on her financially and physically not to mention the emotional burden of seeing a loved one die slowly . I had to stop going out with our friends for a couple of months, after that saying no was really easy without alcohol or the social pressure of my friends smoking both my big triggers . The cravings never truly disappear, but they diminish in intensity and frequency until not smoking is easier than giving in. [SEP]', '[CLS] You say all it takes is discipline and resolve but then go right into the powerful emotional reasons that motivated you to quit. I think the second part is what it really takes. [SEP]', '[CLS] Come on mate it s not that hard, I ve quit times this morning. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Understanding that the urge to smoke isn't an urge to feel relief. It's anxiety induced from the habit. Once you fundamentally understand that cigarettes aren't calming your nerves they're the reason for you feeling restless in the first place it helps you resist the urge to feed that nicotine bug. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I quit because I got more and more concerned about my skin looks aging as I got older. At the time I had no problem smoking because, in my mind, I was young and able to 'spring back' from anything I did to my body, but being in my s and having the vaguest suggestion of wrinkles totally changed my tone and convinced me to make some changes in my life before it's too late. Sucks because I love cigarettes but it wasn't that hard to quit, it feels like another part of a beauty regimen. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This too for me. I didn't want to get smokers lips. Yikes. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Same here Every time I see someone older smoking I look at their skin  always slightly grayish and sallow looking. And smokers lips are the worst. [SEP]', \"[CLS] okay so i'm days in with no cigarette, i've tried to quit twice before and this is the longest i've gone. i've found the only time it will work is if you seriously want to quit yourself, not from people pressuring you. smoke what you've got left by rationing it out for the next few days, don't buy any more and go cold turkey once they're gone. i'm vaping through this, helps a lot. also for nicotine cravings, i learnt that we're not addicted to nicotine as such but to endorphin release. i'm putting time into things i enjoy like painting, CONSIDERING exercising at the moment. this should give you some endorphins to keep you happy. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Good luck Keep at it. I had the hardest time quitting. I smoked for years. What worked for me was the patch. I used the Step one and it helped so much with the cravings. The vape helped with the habit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Yeah so every time I wanted one after work I would go down to the gym or go for a run. it SUCKED and I fuckin hated it but I sure as shit didn't want one after working out. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Hey man, great job. Just in case you aren't aware, it only gets easier past day . Days and are often the worst. That's not to say days , , and are easy, but they're often easier than days and . You're almost over that hill. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I am also four days in, maybe . Let's help one another. I am going to PM you, if that's OK. [SEP]\", '[CLS] My mom used to smoke a lot. she was only able to quit because she got very sick, and couldnt breathe if she inhaled smoke. After she got better about weeks later she just didnt start again. [SEP]', '[CLS] it might not work for everybody, but if theres a reason you might be unable to smoke for a while, just try not to start again. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This happened to me a little over three weeks ago. Couldn't breathe so couldn't smoke. Four days passed and I decided to not smoke any more when I could breathe again. Rituals, routines are the hardest part. I chew on coffee stirrer straws and vape at mg after eating for a few minutes. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Don t smoke a cigarette today, just get through the day without one. Then tomorrow do the same thing, just get though the day without one. Small little attainable goals working toward a larger long term goal is an easy way to break it down. I don t even remember when I quit because that day doesn t matter, only today. [SEP]', '[CLS] You have to want to. [SEP]', '[CLS] If you re not doing it for yourself, you re not going to follow through. [SEP]', \"[CLS] We quit using Chantix. The side effects can be tough thankfully we didn't really experience anything bad except for mild depression. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It was really like flipping a switch. At our doctors advise, we smoked for the first days instead of 'just' . After our last cigarette, we destroyed what we had left and never looked back. I didn't expect it to be that easy. We've been smoke free since . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Edit We My husband and I. I couldn't have quit alone. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Worked for me too A combination of the medication going on holiday with a non smoker during the last part of the treatment course ie. no longer smoking but still taking the tablets . I ve never looked back. [SEP]', '[CLS] You just have to get to the point where they stink if you smell someone smoking. Then you re on the home run. [SEP]', \"[CLS] we smoked for the first days instead of 'just' . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Might not work for everyone, but I just completely ignored that part of the book and kept smoking without trying to quit. Sure enough somewhere around day or so I just wasn't smoking anymore. Didn't want it. About a week or so after that I got a craving, broke down and bought a pack. Took two puffs off one cigarette and was like nope, that's not what I wasn't at all . [SEP]\", '[CLS] The way I see it, we can do whatever we want. We are Venom. [SEP]', '[CLS] This is what helped me. Took a break from drinking for a few months too. [SEP]', '[CLS] I took about weeks away from my group of friends that smoke. It really does help. [SEP]', '[CLS] Great idea unless you work in a bar . [SEP]', \"[CLS] Use e cig for transition. Here is how I do when I was burning through roughly packs a weeks at the time, and been smoking for years give or take. I cut half cigarette intake and pick up the strongest e juice. After a few weeks, I will keep cutting cigarette intake. I will cut until I'm completely off then I will start cutting on e juice nicotine level. Then I quit e cig for good. The whole process took me about a year and a half. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Once I SERIOUSLY made up my mind, EVERY time I craved I told myself a day, a day, a day . Something to keep me motivated is simply be within smelling distance of someone who smokes. [SEP]', '[CLS] That s been the biggest motivator for me and just about the only reason I quit, according to my tracker I quit smoking . dollars ago and it feels amazing. [SEP]', \"[CLS] After years of smoking and countless efforts I'm off smoking for a year now. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The things that worked for me quitting on vacation, every soft moment I had I went on doing something active that got my mind on something else videogames, sport running . I used CBD oil without THC once every days to help me sleep better through the first weeks. Honestly, I hardly had any difficulty quitting . [SEP]', '[CLS] Another vote for Chantix. Take your second pill of the day in the early evening instead of later to avoid the weird dreams. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I never got the weird dreams like some people say. When I tried the patch there were def weird crazy vivid dreams, but never with Chantix. So long as they're not bad dreams, it can fun. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I've been thinking of getting this. Do you remember how much it costs. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Take a tab of LSD, smoke cigarette, be disgusted. Quit. At least that's how it happened to me. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I love smoking on lsd. [SEP]', '[CLS] When you are tripping and your holding that cigarette really start asking yourself what am I actually doing with this thing and what is it doing to me a million thoughts, ideas and feelings racing through your head before the cigarette is even out. This will definitely change anyone s perspective on smoking and will no doubt allow a lot of people to quit easily. [SEP]', '[CLS] Lol i like this idea. Now where can i buy some of that LSD medication. [SEP]', \"[CLS] You have to want to quit. Because you want to, not because you know you should. They're very different. When you want to, you do. I decided one night after years chewing tobacco that planning to quit was stupid. I decided that after this can pack week month I'll quit was a completely unnecessary delay. Almost at random one Sunday, I just stopped. That was . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] A staggering number of people can't quit because they just don't want to. They know they should, because it's logical, so they try and try. When you decide that you want to quit, there's no need for any distraction or intervention. You just quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'll be upvoted by cold turkey quitters and downvoted by people who think they're ready but keep failing and don't want to admit to themselves that they really don't want to quit at all. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This was my experience as well. A switch got flipped and I threw out the rest of my pack and never looked back. [SEP]', '[CLS] This is true. I was in welding school and everyone around me smoked. My vape was quickly forgotten as I jumped on the bandwagon for months. Then as soon as I was out of school, I was the only one that smelled bad and I didn t want to do it anymore. Now back on the vape and I haven t touched a cig since. [SEP]', '[CLS] It is, most definitely, wanting to do it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Don t be afraid to admit that you re not ready to quit yet. It ll make you realize sooner when you do actually want to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] You re right. I was kind of a cold turkey quitter. Kinda not. But ultimately, you need to want to quit. I wanted to because I couldn t breathe normally and I felt my heart doing weird stuff. [SEP]', \"[CLS] With Chantix you can quit even if you don't truly want to. Or at least some people can anyway. For me it completely eliminated the desire for them. At one point I had a fond memory craving, broke down and bought a pack. Took two puffs and it was gross and did nothing for me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Cold Turkey advocates can knock it if they want, but not everyone is in a place where they truly want to quit, but know they should. If Chantix can help them be a healthier person and their doctor says it's good, why not. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Don't say to yourself I'm giving up smoking , say I don't smoke anymore . Makes cold turkey much easier. Good luck It's possible. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'd go a bit further, and say don't quit at all. What I mean is, I packed in in July . But I didn't really I'm simply a non practising smoker to this day. I can have a smoke if I want, but I choose not to. It's hard to explain, but after years of trying to give up, this worked. The thought of never smoking again, ever, can be quite overwhelming at first, and you can resent it. It also helps if you end up scavving a ciggie off a mate when drunk you don't beat yourself up about it, because it's OK you're still a smoker anyway. Worked for me, anyway, along with patches for the first week or so to get over the physical side of it. Reckon I was in the clear after a month or so, but the old saying about getting urges on the threes days, weeks, months seemed oddly true. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I disagree. A friend quit smoking by playing a Jedi mind trick on himself. Every time he lit up a cigarette, didn t matter if he was alone or in a crowd of , people, he would say, out loud, I am a non smoker. I do not smoke, as he was lighting it. At first you feel silly, and it just doesn t sit right, because you know you re lying to yourself. Eventually, it becomes a mantra you say to yourself to get through the next hour, or minutes, or even the next minute if the craving is bad enough, until the craving inevitably passes. Worked for years and counting for my friend, and years and counting for me. [SEP]', '[CLS] That s what did it for me. I wasn t quitting smoking, I just don t smoke. Just like I don t do heroin or murder people. It isn t hard to not do those things because they are terrible and I don t do them. Just like smoking is terrible and I don t do it. Mindset is everything. [SEP]', '[CLS] Day is the hardest for the body, take that the day off work or plan it on the weekend. [SEP]', '[CLS] After a couple of weeks the physical craving will never again be as strong as the mental one. [SEP]', '[CLS] Try to quit when life is at a normal or lower level of stress for you, stress is the hardest part of quitting if smoking is a crutch for you like out was for me. [SEP]', '[CLS] Understand that the cravings will never really go away completely. They will get less powerful and less frequent but they will never be gone. Accept that now. A good friend of mine quit in his s and told me before he died in his late s that he still got cravings. [SEP]', '[CLS] I was packs a day for years. Been clean over now. Discipline is the key, this is more about mental addiction than physical. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I can't even get pack a day on my most stressful days, pack makes me feel sick.

[SEP]\", '[CLS] understanding that every time you are having a smoke, you are making an active decision. [SEP]', '[CLS] Mental framing is important. I am not giving up for example, because smoking provides no value so there is nothing to give up. I am stopping instead. [SEP]', '[CLS] I gamify sp it. Counting the days until my next achievement. [SEP]', '[CLS] Count the days like you would in AA. [SEP]', '[CLS] Replacement. I use lozenges as they last for long enough for me to stop thinking about it, taste nice and hit the spot. [SEP]', '[CLS] Habit. There were times when I would get up to have a smoke because that is what I would do through habit. Even days in. I would do something instead. Walk, press ups, video games for a while etc. [SEP]', '[CLS] I was off work, which is not available to everyone. [SEP]', '[CLS] Effort. It was hard at first. Then it got easier. Now I am not willing to break my streak and start again. The habit has gone and the replacement works well. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Don't stop at the first hurdle, you might not be quitting at day . You are just trying to set a high score. Keep going with that and you will make it further each time. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Good luck if you are going to go for it. I smoked heavily for years and if I can do it hopefully then a high of the smokers are up to it. [SEP]', '[CLS] For me it was one day at a time. Set short term goals to make the process more manageable. Recognize that the process will be hard and annoying. The first part is easy, willpower can take you far, and the physical addiction is over in a few days. The truely hard part is breaking the habit it took me months before I stopped thinking about cigs at every commercial break on the tv. Reward yourself with the money you save, eat whatever you want, your metabolism will change anyway gaining some weight is worth it. Good luck.

I noticed a vast deterioration in my lungs and I became concerned.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] years later I still get weird urges once a blue moon for about seconds that I really want one. I don't mind people smoking around me, which was one of the thing I was most worried about once I decided to stop.

Ive ignored them every single time until recently I told myself I want to stop smoking realize that it's not going to happen unless you want the change for yourself. That's where it started for me. Good luck. [SEP]\", '[CLS] You have to do it for you. I tried to quit for someone else and I relapsed so much. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The nicotine patch took the edge off for me. But I found the habit more difficult to break than the addiction. I liked those moments in the day where I could take min for a smoke. I just kept in mind that the longer I abstained, the less of a habit it would be, and that was true. After a few weeks, it wasn't nearly as difficult. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Hooray finally something I can answer. I smoked for years and quit months ago. [SEP]', \"[CLS] First, WANTING to quit is the key. That's step one in the mental battle. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Second, get some kind of nicotine aid at least in the first few weeks. That's to help the PHYSICAL battle. Personally I got patches. Use for as long as YOU need not as long as the pack says. I stopped after . weeks total because I felt I didn't need it anymore but we're all different. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Third, continue reminding yourself WHY you quit and how you've reached the goal and now it's about keeping it.

I gave it a fair shot and I generally enjoy it, but it never latched on like cigarettes ever did. I tried smaller and bigger builds. Currently using a drip tip and I really enjoy using it but it doesn't do it for me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It seems like although it will help me power through a craving, it's VERY temporary. And if I use it too much, my lungs feel like I'm drowning. But it's so yummy. [SEP]\", '[CLS] While stopping may be one of the hardest things you will ever do, it is also the hardest step. Everything after that is cake. [SEP]', '[CLS] First, if you have a friend that smokes and wants to quit, quit together. My friend and I made a bet that the first one to smoke again, even a puff, owed the other . Neither of us have smoked since, about years ago now. [SEP]', '[CLS] Second, quit cold turkey. If you smoke more then a pack a day you should probably ween yourself off. Either way, don t use nicorett gum or the patch or lozenges. Those would be just crutches. That will just decrease your chances of being able to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Third, get involved with an online support group if that will help. Maybe if r quitsmoking or r stopsmoking are things, try those. [SEP]', '[CLS] You may also put all of the cash that you would have spent on cigarettes into a jar, and overtime use it to buy yourself a nice gift or put it away in savings. [SEP]', '[CLS] Good luck to you. It s one of the best decisions of my life. I ve saved so much money. I don t smell terrible anymore. I am able I focus better. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I don't agree with the cold turkey. I would say replacement is easier but they should do what they are comfortable with. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Make a conscious decision that you are now a non smoker. It was for me about having this mindset. You are not a smoker who has quit, or is quitting you are a non smoker, simple. I made sure that I did not touch a tobacco product for weeks, and after that if I tried a cigarette because I craved it or missed it when stressed, drinking or socialising it tasted disgusting and further reiterated in my mind that I was a non smoker. That was years ago I smoked for years and I've never picked up smoking again. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This is the best advice I have seen itt. [SEP]', '[CLS] I suggest quitting cold turkey. Myself quit years ago and the people I know who have quit for good have almost all quit cold turkey. It seems like having a crutch vape, gum, patches inevitably leads back to smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The first weeks are going to be rough, but after that it gets a lot easier. Exercising and being active helped me a lot. Drinking just made me want a cigarette so I didn't drink for several months. A year after I had no real temptation to smoke. About years after I couldn't and still can't stand the smell of cigarette smoke. It's just really gross and I have no idea why I did it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Cigarette smoke, I agree, every time I smell it, my first thought is, what the hell was I thinking Good cigar or pipe tobacco still smells good to me, though. [SEP]', '[CLS] Hey there. I started smoking stolen cigarettes from mom s purse in . I was up to a pack a day in . I stopped for good days, hours, and minutes ago. I haven t cheated or even thought about it seriously since then. Get yourself an app to keep track of your time money. Checking my time money has become a little habit of its own. [SEP]', '[CLS] Here s how you do it. You have to WANT to stop smoking. I ve quit probably or times before but it never lasted for more than a few hours. I d hide a few emergency cigarettes, bum them from someone you get the idea. I never WANTED to stop. I loved smoking. I loved it. When I started you could still smoke on airplanes, for Pete s sake. It s gotten hard to smoke for a variety of reasons. I mean, even when you re OUTSIDE people give you a hard time. Plus, I ve dropped over , on ash, litter and making myself unhealthy. What s crazy is that even after years my body is healing remarkably quickly. [SEP]', '[CLS] If you don t WANT to quit, don t bother. You ll find yourself somewhere that sells them or asking someone for one before you know it. I m days in. I m concentrating on how well I m breathing sleeping. That s much better for me. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Just don't smoke. Don't let excuses win. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Easy as hell to quit if you buy a decent vaporiser. Not a crappy pen. [SEP]', '[CLS] I personally have a sigelei fuchai with a kylin tank, but any of the bigger vapes will do.

You can reduce the amount of nicotine, or just stop altogether whenever you feel comfortable to.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Surprisingly out of a handful of things I ve quit smoking was by far the easiest to get out of, but also back into. It s just a matter of staying conscious about it for me at least.

Maybe cigarettes a day. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Quitting brought about even more migraines and exhaustion. So I switched to a vape and have used that to ease off. I still use it, but just because the motion is comforting. Not for the nicotine. It can be difficult, but when you realize how much easier it gets to breathe and the money you save, it begins to feel worth it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Find what will really make you want to give up for me it was getting pregnant and using an e cigarette I mixed up all the things so I didn t know if I was getting nicotine or not and just kept adding more no no nicotine ones. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I chew the cinnamon nicotene gum and it works, I also carry big red because I don't want to increase my nicotene intake like I did with vaping.

Nice halfway house for the first week or so, while still keeping the motivation of not longer smoking tobacco. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Medication can help. I managed to quit a pack a day habit almost years ago. I used Zyban. I also had a great desire to quit and had to completely dig deep for willpower. It helped that I was deployed to Iraq at the time. I know it sounds nuts quitting smoking in a war zone but that actually made it a little easier. First it was sand storm season when I quit. I wasn't going to go outside in that shit just to smoke a cigarette. Second I knew that my then girlfriend now wife wasn't going to want to live with me if I smoked. And third I was in a fucking war zone. Everyone was on edge and acted like a dick. So being an asshole suffering from the nic fits didn't really make me stand out. Besides, I was assigned to a unit I wasn't a part of back in garrison in the states So what did I care if they thought I was an asshole once in a while I never saw any of them after I rotated back home. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] One thing I did every day that really helped was remind myself how long it was since I had a cigarette. And also remind myself that if I smoked even just one I would have to start over again. I haven't had a smoke in days. But if I have one today tomorrow I'll have to say 'I haven't had a smoke in ONE day'. Fuck that . [SEP]\", '[CLS] I switched to vaping but had to quit that. People say vaping is the safer altetnative. I disagree. Both my wife and I are runners. We have smoked and ran, been smoke free and done it with vaping. Vaping and running was hard. Worse than smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] After fifteen years of chimney life I went to doctor and asked for help quitting. The doctor said to read The Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Alan Carr. She said if I read it and was still smoking she would give me Chantix. [SEP]', '[CLS] Read it, followed the directions, and quit cold turkey with zero withdrawal symptoms. In fact, rather than withdrawal, I felt amazing. I attributed it to the fact that my brain was finally getting the correct amount of oxygen for the first time in years. [SEP]', '[CLS] I think the biggest thing about quitting is you have to be ready to. You have to be ready to be done with this thing. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My wife used a e cigarette or whatever they are called but filled it with a liquid that didn't have nicotine in it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Alan Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking. I was a pack a day smoker, absolutely loved it, did the audiobook over a week, and on Friday I quit cold turkey, it's been well over a year now, and haven't had a cig since. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Acknowledge that you will always be a smoker. The urges will always happen from time to time no matter the years. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That's not true, not for every one because I despise even the slightest smell of tobacco. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I really thought I wouldn t be able to quit after years of smoking. I tried to go cold turkey a million times and it didn t work. But then I focused on why do I smoke. [SEP]', '[CLS] First, you have to actually want to quit. It helps if you don t hang out with smokers, I ll be honest. But even if you do, try to hang out in situations when they re less likely to smoke movies, out to dinner etc . [SEP]', '[CLS] Then you have to break down the habits triggers that make you want to smoke, one by one. This is the only thing that worked for me. So my biggest I need a cigarette moments came. [SEP]', '[CLS] when I was drinking coffee. [SEP]', '[CLS] drinking that s the biggest one . [SEP]', '[CLS] So over the course of years it really took me that long I broke each of those habits one at a time. I would challenge myself to drive to work without a cig. Then challenge myself to drive home without one always saying to myself that I could have one later if I want . [SEP]', '[CLS] Then the next day I would say well, you didn t smoke while driving yesterday, so you can probably do it again. [SEP]', '[CLS] Did that with every major smoking trigger. [SEP]', '[CLS] The worst was trying to quit while drinking. There s nothing I love more than a cigarette with a glass of wine. [SEP]', '[CLS] For that, I took my first vacation in a while visiting my husband for a week in mexico and left my cigarettes at home. I told myself I was just going to drink and hang out for one week without them. I could always smoke when I returned. Then, of course, when I returned, I told myself hey. You didn t smoke while drinking in Mexico, so you can drink without a cigarette here. [SEP]', '[CLS] A change of scenery was incredibly helpful if just for a week. [SEP]', '[CLS] So now it s been months and I have no desire to smoke again. I ll be honest, I tried one a month ago while hanging out with a friend and it just tasted gross. [SEP]', '[CLS] Sorry about the ramble, but that s what worked for me. [SEP]', '[CLS] Lollipops or dum dums, whatever you want to call them. Get a big bag of them. [SEP]', '[CLS] Every time you want a cigarette, have one of them instead. I always felt I could deal with the nicotine withdrawal, but I always wanted something in my hand and in my mouth yeah yeah, I know how that sounds  . [SEP]', '[CLS] The dum dums helped with a ton with that. [SEP]', '[CLS] Halls. Lots of Halls eucalyptus. They also work well for munchie suppression. [SEP]', '[CLS] rd day is the worst. [SEP]', '[CLS] I smoked like it was a cure for cancer for yrs. First thing I did upon waking was light a cigarette, last thing I did at night was put one out. When I quit, I was at a minimum of a pack and a to packs a day if I went out after work. [SEP]', \"[CLS] During that yrs I tried so many times to quit but in the end what worked for me I've been smoke free for years is NOT changing any single part of my routine. When I had tried to quit in the past, I would stop drinking coffee, not go to bars with friends drinking partying made me smoke more , anything that I associated with smoking until I was passed the initial detox stage, but once I started drinking coffee and socializing more etc it was still an immense trigger to smoke and eventually that is exactly what I'd end up doing, again. So the final time I changed NOTHING, the only thing I did differently was not smoke. It did make it tougher to begin with, but absolutely nothing became a smoke trigger for me. The one other thing I did was a of a nicotine gum when I just couldn't take it any more. I was uber careful not to get addicted to them and only chewed when in absolute agony. These may or may not work for you, but something will bcs I fucking LOVED smoking just didn't want to pay for it anymore and if I can do it, you can too Good luck. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Find a reason for yourself. A reason that you truly want to quit for. If you can't forget about it and revisit when you can. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] If you don't really want to quit, you won't. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Combination of things for me. Vaping helped. But not the kind that tastes good. I used the 'tobacco' flavor and the vape looked like a cig and it seemed the closest to actual smoking. Never completely scratches the itch, but helps significantly. Also meeting and talking to smokers who had been doing it for decades helped. Just seeing them and hearing their stories made me know I never wanted to let myself get there. It helped give me the strength to keep away from cigs. I was a little over years in when I quit and it was still very difficult to do so. Took separate tries and always seemed to fall back into it either weeks or months in to quitting. Now it's been years. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Don't count the days you've gone with out a cigarette. It's too much pressure. Just go today without a cigarette. Then tomorrow just go without a cigarette. Repeat. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Also vaping really helped too. It curbed the craving for that one day you want to have a cigarette. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Read Allen Carr's easy way to quit smoking . Its basically magic. I smoked for over a decade, two packs a day. I tried cold turkey, the patch hypnosis, sometimes I could quit for months but would come back, sometimes I could cut it down but I had gotten to a point where I accepted I would never truly quit. Then I read the book and never smoked again, never had the urge to smoke, never had a single withdrawl symptom. Easiest thing I ever did, read the book and you wont smoke. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Every single day of my life since I think It feels great that I dont have to smoke today . Its the best gift you will ever give yourself. [SEP]', \"[CLS] So I've only been smoke free for a week and days, so I don't know how much advice I can give. That being said, I've been chewing nicotine gum. Takes the edge off and it's better than smoking. Good luck. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Patches helped me go from a pack a day to . From there, I had hernia sugery and just decided to quit. Was a month nicotine free on Wednesday. You can do it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Change your habits, like a diet. Smokers smoke based more on patterns and habits than they realize. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Vaping helps for cravings get a cheap one, it's not a replacement for smoking . [SEP]\", '[CLS] And toothpicks. Good for those driving cravings and after meal cravings. [SEP]', \"[CLS] It's been over a thousand days since I quit, and I still crave one every fucking day. Accepting that you will want to smoke for the rest of your life is another big part. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Here's what I did For several nights in a row, hell maybe even a few weeks, I would chain smoke just before bed until the point of feeling like i was about to puke. Then I got some nicotine gum and chewed way more than i was supposed to, again, I felt like I was going to puke. Did that until the two week supply was gone. I forced myself to associate smoking cigarettes with feeling like I was going to puke, so it was less enticing to pick the habit back up if I felt any urges. I did this roughly years ago. I've smoked a few times since then when drinking with friends strictly in a social setting and I've never had any desire to pick the habit back up, even the act of smoking while drinking wasn't pleasurable, so it's been years since i've done that as well. This may not be your traditional method, but for me it worked. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Don't give yourself time until x and then I quit . I've done that times and I managed like two weeks each time. [SEP]\", '[CLS] You have to just decide to quit, and do it right there and then. For me that was when I was running I exercised for a k and realised my performance was piss poor because my lungs were fucked after years of smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] I decided to quit then, on the walk back home. And with some effort actually managed it. [SEP]', '[CLS] You will only quit when you are truly ready, then, and only then quit and never do it again. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Don't change your lifestyle at the same time. For me I took a week away then came back and did everything the same without the smokes. Aka still went out for cigarette brake. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Figured I d try not smoking anymore. [SEP]', '[CLS] Haven t felt the need to smoke since, because tonsillitis sucks and I guess I want to live longer Idk. [SEP]', '[CLS] I was a smoker for years before quitting. [SEP]', '[CLS] The most important thing is to make the decision to quit. You cant just kinda want to quit, you must really want it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I decided in November that I would have my last cigarette on the st of January and smoked normally until them. On the new years eve I even bought a pack and finished it the same night. Didn't smoke ever since. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It wasn't easy, especially the first week, but after month I felt much better. [SEP]\", '[CLS] It has been almost years now and sometimes I still feel like having a smoke. When that happens I just try to distract myself. [SEP]', '[CLS] Black peppercorn, take one every time you feel like a cig, worked for me. [SEP]', \"[CLS] You have to want to quit. I quit before for six years and have a little over four and half years this go around. Neither time would have been successful if I truly didn't want to quit, otherwise you're just wasting your time. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I smoked a pack a day for a little over ten years. Every time I quit and failed, I tried to 'customize' the solution for me. I.e, use the gum or the patch most of the time, but not on weekends or stressful days. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The successful quit was when I finally said im buying patches, in the strength they recommend, will not smoke at all, and it doesn't matter how uncomfortable it is or how expensive it is, I will continue until there are no more patches . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Nicotine patches are uncomfortable and leave zitty, rashy patches. People don't talk about that part. Or that they cost more than cigarettes for less nicotine. [SEP]\", '[CLS] But in the end, it was shutting the fuck up, doing what the box said, and sticking to my guns that got me to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Avoid bars and other situations where you will drink alcohol around other smokers for the first month. It's the easiest place to get sucked back into smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] You already quit. It's easy to quit. The hard thing is to not start again. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Quit at the same time as my wife and we were both too stubborn to be the first one to go back. [SEP]', '[CLS] In all honesty it is the nicotine dosage you are use to. Vapes e cigarettes let you control your dosage and you can decrease it gradually over time. Then when your down to mg or less, you start seeing less of a dependence on it. Eventually I just stopped all together within a year. Still vape during the cold months though, vape and coffee in the morning used to be cig and coffee . Honestly it changed everything. [SEP]', '[CLS] Make quitting your new habit. Keep trying, you will fail many times, but keep at it and it ll get easier. Also, condition yourself to be disgusted by cigarettes. If someone s smoking on the street take a wide path around them like it makes you sick. Cringe if you see butts on the ground. Get used to seeing cigarettes as a revolting, nauseating, poisonous turd candle. [SEP]', '[CLS] Keep on trying and be introspective about why you tricked yourself to think that it was fine for you to start again. If you can come to the realization that your brain always keeps a valid reason to come back to it at some point and crush those though you will have a greater chance of success. Also, multiple attempts makes you better at dealing with the psychological withdrawal. [SEP]', '[CLS] I quit in . I made it a game. I really cared about the streak more than I cared about the health improvements. Eventually, I cared about the health improvements more. I always heard of you can make it days, you can quit. So I made it to . Then , , , and so on. You get to a certain point where you might want a cigarette, but that would mean your streak is over and you have to start over. I had dreams where I would smoke and wake up temporarily upset, but realize it was a dream and my streak was still in tact. Anyone can quit and everyone should quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] I also had some motivation to get it started. My now wife, then friend, said it was gross. Also, you re paying some mega corporation to poison yourself. People are getting rich off of you fucking your shit up. That doesn t seem right. [SEP]', '[CLS] as soon as I realized how disgusting my cough was I knew i needed to stop. Coughing up all the nasty black mucus from your lungs in the months after quitting was enough to convince me to never go back. [SEP]', '[CLS] I got TB. They get really cranky in the respiratory clinic when you rock in for your TB treatment smelling of cigarettes. [SEP]', '[CLS] You have to want it . [SEP]', '[CLS] you cant quit for someone else, You have to want to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] How did i quit I delayed before my next smoke, Instead of having one now, lets rather smoke in minutes. When the minutes was up, let's delay it again . [SEP]\", '[CLS] about years later, i still waiting. [SEP]', '[CLS] Your mind has a crazy ability to convince you of things. On Friday, it will try to convince you that you should really just buy a pack and wait until Monday to quit. On Monday, it will assure you that it makes the most sense to wait until the weekend to quit, so you should just go buy a pack. You need to be committed to telling your mind to fuck right off with that. [SEP]', '[CLS] Everyone can quit for just one day right Do that everyday. Wake up and quit for the day, not forever cause that s stressful. Just one day and repeat. This has worked for me for and a half years. [SEP]', '[CLS] Persistent is key. Tried for years and it eventually worked. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Quit when my ex was pregnant. Because I didn't want the baby to be around smoke and figured I'd get a jump start on it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] So that's my advice. Have a baby. p. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] For me, the first days were the hardest. I'd say it peaked on day , with shakes and irritability. You really have to want to quit. I quit multiple times, but if I got stressed, I'd revert back to it again. It's when I finally wanted to quit, that I had success. I used nicorette gum at first, and changing my routine up to take away the triggers. It's not easy, and I still have moments where I want one, but I feel so much better now. I never realized how hard it was to breathe when I got sick, or how much I wheezed when I laughed. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Read Allan Carr s easy way to quit smoking. Worked for everybody I know who read it and quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I'd say isolation. For me, the best thing was to sleep off the haze of not smoking. It was foggy brained and angry. I slept a lot. Around the th day I came home and was like Cool I can do something and not want to destroy it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Also, mini nicotine lozenges. If you don't want to be a cave dweller for a month to get past the bad stages, level out with these. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Every day you don't at least try is another day you won't quit.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] Just realizing how bad your breath smells after smoking throughout the day does miracles, really I used to think that people who hate cigarette odour are just normies . Once I stopped smoking for a few weeks, I suddenly realized that people who smoke smell bad, like shit equivalent bad. Realizing that that's how non smokers perceive me, it was much easier not to return smoking.

I bought a fairly expensive vape as an investment towards staying smoke free. I also use tobacco flavoured vape juice so its a similar taste. I also use nicotine gum for that 'after meal' craving, which really works. Overall, I'd say the first days are the hardest. You'll feel a little spacey as your body adjusts to the lack of cigs but I personally feel more grossed out by cigarettes the longer I don't smoke. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Cold turkey is the only way. I tried every other cessation device and all that does is prolong the nicotine addiction withdrawal. Embrace the fact you re going to be short tempered and lacking a filter for a time.

By the time I finally quit for real I genuinely wanted to. [SEP]', '[CLS] Whyquit.com was also really helpful for me, as were the discussion forums. [SEP]', '[CLS] Cold turkey worked for you and my grandparents. I don t know anyone else who was able to just quit. I ve tried a few times, failed because I genuinely don t want to quit smoking. I enjoy it, I enjoy the actions you make while smoking. The hard part for me isn t really not smoking, it s not doing the things I do while smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Don't give up. The average successful quitter made seven previous unsuccessful attempts. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Have a plan.

You get the idea. [SEP]', '[CLS] The psychological addition is what gets dooms most quit attempts. Many people self soothe with tobacco, so when the shit hits the fan they return to what they know will make them feel better. The old cliche of someone buying a pack of cigarettes for the first time in years after some traumatic life event is actually quite accurate.

[SEP]', '[CLS] This mental trick turns quitting from a battle into a pleasure. Sounds dumb maybe but it really worked for me. [SEP]', '[CLS] I m only three weeks at this point but I can already see a nice savings in the bank considering I was buying a pack a day. Truthfully I quit a zillion times and this particular time was because I was so broke and didn t want to charge cigs anymore. Sucked it up. Keep ignoring the cravings. Haven t been to smoking bars or really drank that much at all honestly since thy go hand in hand. [SEP]', '[CLS] The trick is to have a cigarette and then never have another one again until you die. [SEP]', '[CLS] Both my parents quit cold turkey about ten years ago after about years of smoking for my mom and ish for my dad. What they did is sit down and do the math on how much money they were spending on cigarettes per month. They were both pack per day smokers, so it ended up being about a month. My mom told my dad that they were smoking what they had left and then were done. It worked, although my dad was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer about months later. [SEP]', '[CLS] Mine was almost purely financial. I didn t have a lot of money to save and use for hobbies and toys after bills. I did the math, and at for my former brand, times packs a day, it something like dollars a month is saved. Now, I ve reigned my spending back in and am trying to upgrade my overall quality of life. [SEP]', '[CLS] Du it cold turkey, fuck nicotine patches,cum,spray vapes whatever just quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Helpfull for the cravings is to do something orally, have a mint, chew ona toothpick,have a piecve of fruit  something to take your mind of the craving, they wont take long to go away. [SEP]', '[CLS] and nr tip, It s much much easyer then you think, it s all in your head anyway so just put your mind to it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Everyone s different, but here s what worked for me. [SEP]', '[CLS] . First, I cut back. This not only reduced my addiction, but also reduced the frequency of habit. [SEP]', '[CLS] . When you officially quit, have a non tobacco source of nicotine available. I had some nicotine patches even though I wasn t doing the whole patch program where you use them to slowly taper off. I ended up using two patches total, at the lowest dose they came in, at moments of fuck this, I feel like shit and want a cigarette Once the symptoms wore off and I was past that fuck this moment, I removed the patch. It just kept me from choosing a cigarette to satisfy my addiction. [SEP]', '[CLS] . I stayed away from smoke and smokers for a while to avoid temptation. [SEP]', '[CLS] . Over the next few years, I didn t view it as a failure or as a reversion back to being Smoker with a capital S if I had a cigarette or two. I had handful of such slips while out for a night of drinking, but I just didn t allow myself to view that as, Welp, I guess I m smoking again, then. I just woke up the next day still thinking of myself as a non smoker and went on with life. That said, I also didn t let myself start thinking I could smoke socially. That s how I became a Smoker with a capital S the first time. [SEP]', '[CLS] Just fucking do it. No excuses. No cutting down . [SEP]', \"[CLS] You're either smoking or you're not smoking. Quitting smoking is a delusion, you're still smoking. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Oh, and if you find yourself relapsing after that one cigarette with your night of drinking, then quit drinking and adapt the never again, policy. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This may or may not work for people, but it did for me. Sometimes you don't crave the smoke, but having something in your mouth instead. Which I why I took up chewing on toothpicks. Haven't picked up a smoke in years. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This is the one that got me. Write an honest list of pros and cons. Two weeks of a struggle is worth it for the rest of your life. Also I actually wanted to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] You really have to want to quit. Can't just be on the fence about it. You have to commit, fully. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Was a heavy smoker for almost years and tried many different methods to try to quit. The patch is ultimately what kept me going strong. I used to have extreme cravings when trying cold turkey, the patch almost completely alleviated all the nicotine withdrawal symptoms. [SEP]', '[CLS] Going to the gym helped as well as it let me focus my energy on something else and distracted me from any small cravings that would sneak by the patch. But, discipline is what is going to clench the deal for you here. [SEP]', '[CLS] just dont smoke my man. [SEP]', '[CLS] This will probably sound like bad advice, but this is what worked for me after trying vaping, Chantix good for those who it works for, but Jesus it had some horrible affects on me , the patch, and gum. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Like a lot of people, I went cold turkey but unlike previous attempts I instead hit my vices harder than I normally would. I relished in the pain of cravings after eating. I drank more knowing that I'd like to eventually drink and not smoke. I hung out around smokers still. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The idea was that I had heard a lot of people have cravings years after quitting due to certain triggers. I wanted to reset my triggers. By resetting those triggers to not be associated with smoking anymore, it made quitting long term easier. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Now, I'll say that the first week this way was way harder than any other way, but it was pretty smooth sailing after like weeks. I've been smoke free for over two years and unlike many I absolutely do not have any cravings to smoke. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] 'Quitting forever and ever' was a very stressful thought for me. [SEP]\", '[CLS] What worked was to not smoke for h. If I was going to smoke after that h, so be it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Tl DR One day at a time. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This is probably going to be downvoted to all hell but what helped me years ago was just making a conscious decision that I'm not a smoker anymore. I had tried quitting a few times even tried those make cigs taste like shit pills but always seemed to crack and go back to it. By approaching it with the I'm trying to quit mentality you give yourself the possibility of failing to quit, but once I made the conscious decision that I don't smoke anymore it stuck. I did still get cravings but whenever any of my friends offered me a smoke I just said nah, I don't smoke anymore. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Honestly, I never had a hard time quitting cold turkey, even when I got up to a pack a day. What would set me back is I always started smoking again while drinking. So in order to keep the habit gone, I stopped drinking for like two or three months because the temptation was too strong and my willpower was nonexistent when drunk. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I guess my advice is, if you have something you STRONGLY associate smoking with, quit it too if possible for awhile until you break that association, then resume it. If it's something you cannot quit, such as you smoke while driving to from work, have a replacement. My brother in law packed a little bag of snacks to eat on his car ride home instead of smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Best wishes getting tobacco free I still get urges sometimes but it's been years for me, so I rarely think about actually giving into those urges anymore. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Be drunk for days. When you want to smoke  drink. [SEP]', '[CLS] days too drunk sleep hungover to smoke. Then physical addiction is over. [SEP]', '[CLS] And then you are stubborn enough to not give in to something silly and weak as just a mental habit . [SEP]', '[CLS] Dont let your mind play that trick on you. [SEP]', '[CLS] And then for over years have super realistic dreams of smoking a cig . [SEP]', '[CLS] Cold turkey is the only sustainable option. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Don't make a big deal out of it. Just stop. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I found every time I tried and I told everyone that I was quitting, then people kept questioning me about it and asking how it's going etc. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Once I just stopped smoking without telling everyone and just pretended that I never smoked, I just stopped. Probably won't be as easy for everyone, but it certainly worked for me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] First and foremost, you have to be ready. Don't just think you're ready. No fallback plan. You have to be prepared to quit. Give yourself goals to meet. They don't have to be huge goals. If you always have a smoke after dinner, give that one up. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Myself, I used vaping as a tool. This was about years ago, before it got huge and showy . As soon as I got my e cig, that was it for buying smokes. It came with a small bottle of the juice. I think it was mg or . nicotine. Each time my bottle was empty, which took about weeks, I cut the nicotine in half. By the time I got to , I was elated. At that point, on my second day of the juice, I asked myself why I'm even doing it. I put it down and never picked it up again. My wife was doing the same thing, and put hers down weeks after me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] If you're trying to quit, don't make it big news. Don't do it for the glory. Do it for you and if you have kids, do it for them. Hell, if I could do it, anybody can. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] You have to want to quit, then you quit. It isn't easier or harder than that. I got home one day from work I smoked . packs a day, and my kid wanted a hug and Kiss, and I said no I had to wash first, she looked devastated. Last time I smoked. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Get a coronary calcium heart scan. Look at the results with your doctor. Realize that what you're viewing is in large part due to the inflammation that smoking causes throughout your body. Realize that what you are viewing is similar to viewing the gun that will likely kill you one day. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Your face then feels hot, you have a horrific sinking feeling in your gut as it dawns on you that you are the one who loaded that gun. [SEP]', '[CLS] I put them down that afternoon, cold turkey, after years. Quit, quit now. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I bought a JUUL. Started replacing cigarettes with vaping. After two weeks, am exclusively using JUUL . It's only been a week but I went to gas station to buy pods and had no desire to buy a pack. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I have a long road ahead of me but I'm fighting for my life. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Late to the party here, but I quit cold turkey after smoking for years. I smoked all but the last cigarette in my pack, and then kept that pack on me for a few months. Every time I wanted a smoke, I would take out that last cigarette and think about it. Finally ended up throwing it away. Haven t smoked in almost years now. [SEP]', '[CLS] Just woke up and didnt light one. Havent smoked in months. [SEP]', '[CLS] Improve other aspects of your health diet, exercise, sleep and the negative effects of smoking will be more noticeable. It s hard to keep smoking when you can feel it restricting your breathing, speeding up your heart, etc. [SEP]', '[CLS] CBD vapes are also great. Doesn t give you a head rush like nicotine vapes but helps with anxiety and irritation. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Get old. I went from a casual smoker to hating it just by the simple fact of getting migraine like hangovers every monring after I had even smoke the night before. Now I can't even stand to be in smoky bars. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] After years of a pack a day smoking, I can happily say that as of today, I am days smoke free. The first days are the worst, and I chewed the shit out of nicotine gum. After that, cravings subside and I replace every other piece of nicotine gum with dentyne ice, and now I just chew the dentyne. The cravings never fully go away, you just don't notice them as much, and are easier to shrug off. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The biggest factor for me though, is will power. If you don't truly want to quit, you won't. You absolutely need the drive and motivation to plow through those first few shitty days. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit cold turkey but my appetite went up and I basically ate every bit of food I saw to distract me. [SEP]', '[CLS] This happened for a few weeks. [SEP]', '[CLS] This does work but obviously comes with the price of gaining pounds. [SEP]', '[CLS] I guess my point is find something else to distract you from the urge to smoke. [SEP]', '[CLS] Cold turkey, and try to enjoy the pain of withdrawals,tenis ball technique,cold showers. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Don't announce that you are quitting, just stop. I did it cold turkey with half a pack still in my center console. I left the pack there years ago. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I switched to a vape and then used the patches. It wasn t a magic cure but it really does help the cravings, just take it off when you sleep cuz man it ll fuck up your dreams. [SEP]', '[CLS] I don t like gum and mints, so I would practice my singing instead, because then it forced me to think about the song. Took my mind off it and was good practice. [SEP]', '[CLS] Any non stressful hobby is good. I used to play league of legends and would always smoke when it made me mad, and other things too. Quitting those stressful things reduced my cravings since it was how I coped with them. [SEP]', '[CLS] The first week is HARD and takes grit and lots of sunflower seeds . After that it gets much easier. Chew lots of whitener gum, keep sunflower seeds in your car at ALL times and drink tons of water. Good luck. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Just do it. You have to remind yourself that you don't need that cigarette. The cravings will pass if you keep yourself occupied with something else and breaking the relationship that cigarette has to certain activities. Smoking is more of a habit that gives you something to do more than anything else. Once you break the habit of relating smoking to going out with friends break time at work having a beer driving ect it became very easy to quit. [SEP]\", '[CLS] When you feel like having a smoke, drink a glass of water. [SEP]', '[CLS] Just stop. Thinking about it makes it worse. [SEP]', \"[CLS] You've got to want it. No, not kind of, not feel like you have to, you have to viscerally, deeply WANT to stop smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Hopefully, it won't be a health scare that makes you want to quit, like it was for me. Thought I might lose my leg. Scared the living hell out of me.   Finally quit two weeks later. Heh. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Just quit. Go cold turkey. If you need some sort of help, replace smoking with something else. Eating fruits worked for me. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Just don't tell anyone you are quitting. Puts unnecessary pressure on yourself and when you have moments of weakness you feel defeated and worse about yourself. Just make the conscious decision to quit and keep it to yourself. [SEP]\", '[CLS] . Create new habits. I used to enjoy a cigarette after work every day on my balcony. Of course I also smoked in between, but just going on my balcony made me lust after a cigarette. I used to buy some non alcoholic beer or special lemonade as a treat. [SEP]', \"[CLS] . Pro and Contra Lists. Many non smokers who possibly never smoked don't seem to understand why people would smoke. It's expensive, it's unhealthy, it smells Write down whatever is annoying about smoking to you. [SEP]\", '[CLS] While all of these points are true, it would be delusional to say that there are no other positive things about smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] In my case, for example, I liked several things about it. It was my excuse to take a break several times a day, especially at work So I watched out that I would still take some small breaks in between, because I did not want to associate smoke free with harder work. [SEP]', '[CLS] I used to smoke in stressful situations. I used deep breathing techniques and mindfullness. [SEP]', '[CLS] In positive situations where smoking was my treat, I was looking for other treats sweets, gum, a nice smelling candle, small things like that . [SEP]', \"[CLS] Honor the positive things about smoking. Try to find other ways to get the good things . And if you fall back and have a cigarette, don't treat it as a failure. It's part of recovery to have set backs. Just start new. Focus on your list. What do you want in life, why do you want to quit, what helps to feel better. [SEP]\", '[CLS] . Avoid smoking areas. This was big for me, personally, because surrounded by smokers was much, much harder to resist the urge. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Remember that physical addiction is not your biggest enemy the psychological one is. Don't try to reason 'that it's stupid' and ignore it blindly. Try to make a decision to be smoke free. If you relapse, decide it again. It's hard. It can stay hard. That's okay. Good luck. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Not me but my Grammie. I was years d in the bath at my Grammies house. She went outside for just a few minutes to smoke, and when she came back I was drowning. She saved me and then quit smoking from then on. Unfortunately she died when I was from COPD among other health problems, but I admire her for taking the event seriously enough to quit that moment. [SEP]', '[CLS] When I was quitting someone told me that the craving for a cigarette only lasts as long as it takes to smoke a cigarette. If you get the craving and can hang tough for minutes, the craving will generally pass. At least until the next time your body wants one. [SEP]', '[CLS] You have to ride out one craving at a time. One day at a time. And mentally prepare yourself for a long few months. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I vaped and gradually lowered the nicotine strength in my liquids until I was on nicotine and then one day I realised I hadn't vaped all day because I had no cravings so i quit that as well. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Two things I learned after trying a million times and the last time it finally taking for good, hopefully. [SEP]', '[CLS] . It takes awhile to get over it. If you smoked for years you don t get over it in a week. It took a good year to really feel like I was getting past it. [SEP]', '[CLS] . And I learned this the last time I quit and it s worked so far all there years, I can t slip back to it even once. No cigar while playing golf. No hit of a friends cigarette outside the bar late. Because that s what always tripped me up before. Stay vigilant. [SEP]', '[CLS] Gonna get buried now but honestly, cold turkey was the easiest way. I tried patches, the inhalers and vaping but the best way is to just go cold turkey and fight through it. Any other way you end up transferring your addiction to somewhere else, when my brother tried to quit he ended up addicted to dr pepper of all things. Vaping is a decent way of doing it if you still want to go through the motions but doing it in a hopefully safer manner. [SEP]', \"[CLS] First you have to really want to quit. Doesn't matter the reason but from the bottom of your heart you need to want to quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Second you need to realize that you're an addict. And it's just like quitting any other drug. It's a bit easier because you don't have actual pangs that hurt. It's a bit harder because smoking is everywhere. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Cutting down never worked for me. It's because when you cut down, you wait for those times when you can have that precious cigarette. Stop romanticizing smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I read the book everybody's talking about. But I think it only helped because I wanted it to. And the hardest part was not quitting, it was staying clean. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] You have to get rid of it from your routine. For me the hardest was when I had to wait for something. Cigarette always helped with passing time. Now it's reddit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Now sometimes when it gets hard you need to remind yourself why you're better now. And why was it horrible to smoke. For me it's all the times I wanted a cigarette so bad, I couldn't enjoy the activity I was doing. Because in many activities you can't smoke. But if you want to, that's the only thing you think about. So whenever I think that maybe want just one cigarette, I try to remember that feeling. Because if I take one, I will probably start again. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit smoking once. Worst day ever. [SEP]', '[CLS] Giving up is easy, its hard to keep at it. Distance yourself from the other smokers for a week or two and just quit. It won t work unless you see the damage it is causing to you. Once you see the physical damage on your own body is when you really need the feel to stop. [SEP]', '[CLS] Switched to Cuban handrolled cigarillos. Robust smoke. Never fully inhaled. [SEP]', '[CLS] The nicotine buzz comes on slower than tobacco, making them less addictive. Smoked per day for a few weeks, then stopped. [SEP]', '[CLS] Still smoke cigars on special occasions but never cigarettes. [SEP]', \"[CLS] get adult onset asthma and be forced to quit cold turkey. actually I don't really recommend this but it works. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I recommend people look into the use of LSD. Probably more effective than any method I've tried. This varies per person though, as some people turn into chainsmokers while on acid. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I never felt weening off worked, I just stopped, I ate a lot of lifesaver mints and a big problem I had was a problem with my hands, your hands get into the habit of smoking also, so I had to keep them busy, at the time I would play a lot of video games and anything else to keep them busy. [SEP]', '[CLS] Get an eCig with enough juice and batteries to make sure you always have a vape handy. Treat it like a diabetic kit, meaning if you forget it at home, you turn the fuck around and go get it, no matter what. [SEP]', '[CLS] Never put yourself in a position where you can justify grabbing smokes, because you will. Smokes are WAY easier to get your hands and they cost less than having to buy a backup battery or bottle of juice on the fly. Be smart. Have some discipline. Remember why you want to quit smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Throw your cigarettes away and don't buy more. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] After about days start stepping down your ejuice nicotine level until you're evdntually vaping at mg. It's perfectly okay if it takes a couple of years to get there. I guarantee that once you are vaping at mg you'll question why the hell you're vaping at all. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Oh, and don't become one of those douchy vape asswads. It's a nicotine delivery system, nothing more. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I curved my habit by smoking lots of weed. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Start exercising, start keeping track of exactly how much money you're saving by not smoking, and find a different way to occupy your hands in times where you'd normally smoke. [SEP]\", '[CLS] A big part for me was coming to terms with the fact that you re addicted to it and won t be able to eventually be a just occasionally user. You ve gotta accept that your last smoke really will be your last and go with it from there. [SEP]', '[CLS] Doing it while also making some other sort of routine change helps too, like if you re moving or changing jobs, good time to do it. Or just switch things up enough to remove some of your daily triggers. Maybe start a new fitness plan, or bring lunch to work instead of going out. Whatever you can do to cut out those I always smoke after moments. [SEP]', '[CLS] I just stopped, same as my father . [SEP]', '[CLS] Stop picking up the goddamn cigarette and lighting it, that s literally all it takes. [SEP]', '[CLS] I also love the it reduces my stress no, no it doesn t stop lying to yourself. [SEP]', '[CLS] YMMV but here is what I did. Waited for a long weekend. And locked myself inside my house for the entire time. Announced to everyone I lived with ahead of time what was happening. And asked for patience. After day it got easier. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I'm now years nicotine free. However I still crave it. Every day I want one. But the cravings are different, easily subsided by changing my thoughts. Rather than it consuming them. Everything that used to be a trigger still is. Every drink, every car ride, every meal. But I just think about anything else and it goes away easily. Some days are easier than others. But overall it was a good move. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I tapered off the amount per week and used life changes to not include smoking in them. [SEP]', \"[CLS] eg  figure out how many cigarettes you smoke per week and cut down by each week going forward. The slow decrease isn't going to drive you nuts but you can at least get used to less and less. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Life changes are a good opportunity to develop new habits. I got a new car and decided i wouldn't smoke in it, as much as I loved smoking and driving, I was able to consciously avoid it. Cut my amount per day down a lot right there. [SEP]\", '[CLS] When I started dating my now wife, I made a promise not to smoke around her was open about my habit and she understood and appreciated that I would refrain from doing it when we were together. Ended up smoking even less when we moved in together because she was around a lot more often. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Getting a new job and not hanging out with the smokers is huge too. Developing a oh it's am, better go for a smoke routine at work is very hard to change. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] If you can just use all the changes life throws you to develop healthier routines that don't involve smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Cold turkey is the only effective way to go. Can't ween yourself off. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] And you have to actually WANT to quit. Quitting bc someone else wants you to, or quitting because you kind of think you should won't work. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Learn to find the smell disgusting. What helped for me was one night of drinking where I smoked a stupid amount of darts in one go. Eventually I found them gross. Woke up with that smell on my hand and decided enough was enough. Got on the vape to help with the oral fixation. Occasionally I ll have one, by the time I m half way done I feel gross and remember why I stopped buying them fuckers. [SEP]', '[CLS] Wellbutrin. Suppressed the urges and let me wean off. [SEP]', '[CLS] Both of my parents stopped smoking twice in their lives. It really takes a positive mindset. You need to be disciplined and determined to quit. Make a goal and strive for it. Find another outing to replace smoking like reading or exercise. [SEP]', '[CLS] For me vaping is doing the trick and saving my life. [SEP]', \"[CLS] But don't just go into a store and get whatever they try to push on you. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Do extensive research on devices and their function and get something you might enjoy. [SEP]', '[CLS] Also ask Vapers for advice on devices. Try to find someone willing to take some time and explain whats up. [SEP]', '[CLS] Many vapers me have their recommended devices for smokers. [SEP]', '[CLS] And they are not trying to sell you anything like the store clerk. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Also don't bother to much with the looks of the device. If your a flashy person go flashy. But the looks off the device don't say much about whether you'll like the important part. The vaping. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I think it's also the way to go if you don't want to use anything anymore. In my experience and that of other vapers exvapers. [SEP]\", '[CLS] it is much easier to quit vaping or to not vape for some time than it is to quit smoking. Either by just stopping or first lowering your nicotine dose. And you can do the latter without substracting from the vape experience. [SEP]', '[CLS] I am not certain why that is. I attribute this to some of the other thousands of chemicals that are in cigarette smoke. [SEP]', '[CLS] What worked for me was honestly that I got to a point where I hated smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] In terms of little things that helped with cravings and stuff, I found that exercise was a huge help in general, and for dealing with cravings on the spot I'd down a super cold glass of water really fast or eat some chocolate. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I sort of exchanged my most habitual smokes with other things. I swapped my morning smoke for a brisk walk. Swapped my after lunch smoke for dark chocolate. Swapped my after work smoke for a jog. My after dinner smoke was the toughest, but I would push through it with a tall glass of ice cold water and deep breathing. [SEP]', \"[CLS] If you are serious about quitting, take a week off work when you can. Wait til your next week off from school or whatever. Smoke all your tobacco leading up to it.

The habit isn't broken and it's up to you to not go back. Think of the reason why you quit. It's all psychological. You have suffered the withdrawal effects. You have suffered. Don't allow yourself to suffer when you next decide to quit. You deserve to be healthy. You've got this. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] First you have to actually want to quit.

What made me quit, was after an mile run, all I could think of was smoking a cigarette and wanting a cigarette badly. Finally, I get back from teh run  out of breath, red faced and dying. I go to my room, grab a smoke, go outside and smoke it  it proceeds to be the worst cigarette I have ever had in my life. Along with being out of breath, I felt incredibly horrible and stopped for a long time after that. Now, I do very very rarely. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I used the gum for about a week. Didn't even think about having one because I was getting the nicotine. Then I had to sort of trick myself. I convinced myself that I had already quit smoking and that quitting gum wouldn't be hard. It worked and I haven't had nicotine in over four years. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I went to Delhi on holiday. [SEP]', '[CLS] Tried to have a smoke as normal, lungs turned themselves inside out and told me to go f k myself. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Got home, couldn't smoke anymore. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Frequented r stopsmoking which led to The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Our Father Allen Carr. That book was the key to get me in the right mindset and the first thing I suggest to people who want to quit. Used the app Smoke Free to keep me straight and put things into perspective. During the thick of it, chewing straws, snacking on veggie straws and baby carrots, chugging water, and paying attention to how my body was changing and improving stopped me from giving in to cravings. year, months since my last cigarette. I don't even know why I ever smoked at this point and I have zero desire to go back to it. Waking up not feeling like my chest is on fire is pretty cool, and I have the nose of a bloodhound. Still get winded when I work out but that's a me problem . [SEP]\", '[CLS] i fell off the wagon after years of not smoking. stress has gotten to me lately. [SEP]', '[CLS] Wife made me do it. Smoke free since december. Went cold turkey one day and that was it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Find a smoker that you don't like. Karen, the annoying coworker, or Jacob, the prententious hipster. Channel your hate. Refuse to smoke because you're better than them. Every time you get an urge, remind yourself that those fuckers are gonna die before you do. If they ask you to join them for a smoke, laugh to yourself as they walk alone, dragging the ball and chain of addiction. You want to stop at the gas station and grab a pack You'll be able to afford a nice vacation in a matter of months while they will be financially crippled by addiction. You're better than them and don't ever forget it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Honestly the biggest thing was I stopped hanging out with other people that smoke. In a social bubble by myself it was easy not to smoke but then I'd go hang out with someone that did and I'd inevitably bum one off of them. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] When I quit in I personally found it helpful to replace the hand to mouth ritual with carrot sticks cut to the length of cigarettes. I was told the hardest part to quit was the ritual of it all, it's a psychological comfort as well as a physical addiction, but your body gets over the physical addiction surprisingly quickly about a month I believe , behaviours take longer to change. So I used to still go outside on my work break with my carrot stick and stand there and slowly munch on it at the rate I would have smoked a cigarette, breathing in slowly as I did. It might sound dumb, but it worked for me. Eventually just going out for a breath of fresh air was enough. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Reading the Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Alan Carr and visiting r stopsmoking worked for me. I don t think anyone could read Alan Carr s book without quitting even if they wanted to continue to smoke. I read it as a skeptic just kind of wanting to quit. Been about years now and never missed smoking for a minute. [SEP]', '[CLS] Vaping can make quitting fairly easy since you can control the dosage of nic. Start with mg or so for a few weeks. Then step down to mg for a few weeks. Then , then . [SEP]', \"[CLS] At first vaping sucks and all you can think about is how much better a cig is. But eventually you will come around and it will be fine, or in some cases people end up liking it even more. And during the whole process you will still be getting nic, but not any of the other garbage that's in cigs. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] There's a lot of ways to quit, but I think vaping may be the easiest. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Stay away from other smokers. [SEP]', '[CLS] Just do it. Seriously. I hated that I was smoking and I couldn t take not breathing anymore, so I threw my new pack of smokes into the fireplace and watched them burn. Been two years next month.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] Recognize that if you continue smoking that odds are that something bad to your health could happen. For me, my mother died from lung cancer before she was . It's a painful death and while there are no guarantees that if you quit, it won't happen, but don't you want to improve your odds. [SEP]\", '[CLS] There is nothing cool about smoking. People hate smokers Why do you want to be part of a hated group that you voluntarily join. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Smoking is expensive. Can't you use the money for other things. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Bottom line though, YOU HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT It has to be your genuine desire. That s most of it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] TBH, I stopped smoking cigarettes by substituting with weed whenever I got the urge for a month or two. Then scaling back on the weed was way easier than tobacco. Obviously this method won't work for many but I was fortunate enough at the time to be working a menial job where being stoned didn't matter. Now, that plan wouldn't work at all. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Do whatever it takes. I had to use chantix. Remember, you have to change how you think about certain. Frustrated a little at work, no more smoke break. It will get easier but the first week after i quit, people told me i was a bear. I had to relearn how to be frustrated and mad. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Get a vape, ween yourself down to . nicotine, and then take a week long vacation somewhere you can relax and don't take your vape. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Used to smoke half a pack a day, haven't had nicotine in years. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Obviously results may vary but I feel, with most addictions, willpower is of the battle, and if you really want to quit, you can. [SEP]', '[CLS] Wellbutrin really helped me. I was already on it for depression. When I decided to quit I didn t have physical cravings. Like at all. I was confused until I figured out that it was the Wellbutrin. I still had to overcome the mental addiction but it was SO much easier without the physical withdrawal. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Try various replacements. Get rid of your cigs add lights, as instead of smoking, use a nicorette inhaler, you pull on it just the same as a normal cig but it doesn't smell. When you've been on the inhaler a few weeks, use the spray. It gives you a great hit, and breaks the hand to mouth movement habit. Once you feel like the replacements are all you need, start chewing the gum, just find a flavour that you enjoy. After a while, you'll hate the smell of tobacco and you'll have minty fresh breath while you get your kick. Eventually, take a piece of normal gum instead of the nicotine gum, and gradually repeat this more frequently to reduce your nicotine levels, then try a day with no nicotine at all, just normal gum. If you can't, don't worry, just have a nicotine gum and try again the next day. Eventually, you'll get to a point where when you need a boost you'll just have a piece of normal gum and the craving will disappear. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Chain smoking until I threw up fixed a decade of cancer sticks. I also had the flu at the time, which expedited the vomiting. I'll never forget that taste as long as I live.

[SEP]\", '[CLS] Good luck, OP, you can do it Join the ex smokers club with me. [SEP]', \"[CLS] COLD TURKEY. I tried multiple crutches gum, patches, lozenges, wellbutrin all failed. I wasted years of my life to be exact and countless dollars. One won't quit smoking until one is truly ready. When that time comes, and one is committed, simply stop smoking . Just choose a day to start your smoke free life and enjoy not being a prisoner to smelly fingers and clothes, premature aging, emphysema, etc  It worked for me and I have little to no will power, which is why being mentally prepared and committed is so important. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Make sure you do a proper goodbye to smoking. That is, treat it like a relationship ending, because in many ways it is. It's like cutting a toxic friend out of your life. You need to acknowledge that there will be a sense of loss and allow yourself to experience that. Then cut all ties and walk away. [SEP]\", '[CLS] In the process right now. I find it s easier when you have someone else to quit with. Also bought a vaping pen. Went from packs a week down to . [SEP]', \"[CLS] I honestly found it relatively easy. I had a weekend where I smoked waaaaay too much. I woke up on Monday feeling like a car was on my chest and I was all out of cigarettes. Given the feeling in my chest it was easy to not smoke that day. I woke up Tuesday and didn't think about a cigarette all day. Then on Wednesday I thought about it and realized I should just keep it going because the urge wasn't immense. I'm not smoke free for eight months. [SEP]\", '[CLS] For me it was milestones. Make it the first day. Then make it the first week. Then weeks. It was all downhill for me after weeks. [SEP]', '[CLS] Enter Shia Labouf screaming Just deeewwww it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I got a pretty severe case of reflux acid which in turn led me to have my first panic attack because I thought my heart was failing. Wasn't hard to quit after that.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Find something else to fill in your cravings. [SEP]', '[CLS] crunches or pushups instead of a cigarette. This ones a lot harder to stick to. [SEP]', '[CLS] Or the trick that worked for me. Move to a city where they re stupid expensive with brutal winters. I quit when I ran out and realized I had to walk a couple blocks through a blizzard to waste . [SEP]', '[CLS] Nicotine patches did it for me. Vaping just turned into another addiction. Patches give a constant dose of nicotine throughout the day and cut down in increments. I also cut patches in half to half the dosage near the end too. Not really supposed to do that, but I did it anyway. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Just don't go to sleep with them on. I did a couple times, nicotine interferes with REM sleep and you get some crazy dreams. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Smoked contraband kretek cigarettes and then the government started to tighten up the security and I could no longer find them easily. Smoked less and less, and one day I realised I hadn't smoked for a few days. Tried to see if I could make it to a month just to brag about it. Then it became two months. Then it became almost five years now. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Looking back I was very busy during those days, so ultimately as is the case with many tasks that on the surface require a ton of willpower what will really get the job done is an ample amount of distraction. [SEP]', '[CLS] Pregnancy. I wanted to quit almost as soon as I started smoking but, well, we know how addictions happen. As soon as I saw the positive test I was done. Crossing my fingers it sticks after the bubs is born. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Don't beat yourself up if you try to quit and fail. Just try again, however many times it takes until you are successful. Worked for me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I vaped before vaping was cool. I committed to vaping for hours and then when I lit a cig, the taste was utterly horrible. I did start at the highest nicotine level and brought it down here and there. I vaped for a good two years until I ran out of batteries and couldn't vape for a couple of days and then decided I was done with it since I was going to a family reunion and they would have made fun of me for vaping. lol. I smoked for over years and when I substituted the vape for the cigs I was at a pack a day. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I did the weening method. Allow myself x per day for a couple weeks. Then gradually get lower until you're on like or then you really don't want it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] You have to want to quit, there are lots of tips and tricks to help, but if you don't want to quit you're always going to fail. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That said, I worked it out of my routine and set guidelines around when I was allowed to smoke. Eg  I used to always light up whenever I got in the car, always after a meal, whenever I had my morning coffee  etc. First I got rid of those and only smoked when I really needed it. That cut me back over a month or so to cigarettes a day. From there I switched to the lozenges and cut back to eventually nothing. The lozenges were good to take the crazy out of the cravings when you get them. You can control the dosage of nicotine in the lozenges as well, so it's easy to monitor and decrease the dose over time. Then eventually you just don't do it anymore. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This probably sounds like a dumb reason to quit, but I got tired of the need to buy cigarettes and cigars all the time. Not necessarily the cost, but the need to stop in to another store to replenish my supply. [SEP]', \"[CLS] It was a process. I replaced cigarettes and clove cigars by switching to vaping. After a couple years, started to reduce the amount I vaped, and then at some point, realized that I hadn't touched the vape in days. At that point, it was like, well, guess that means I quit. Smoked a clove on vacation a couple months ago, and didn't even enjoy it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Definitely not a process that will work for everyone, but after somewhere around months off, it must have worked for me. [SEP]', '[CLS] My granny just stopped, overnight, she just said she didnt want to smoke anymore. [SEP]', '[CLS] My dad smokes from a young age and he smoked up until my older brother was about to be born, and my sister was still less than a few weeks. He said he didnt want his bad decision to affect us, and he says it the greatest decision hes ever made. [SEP]', '[CLS] I had started smoking weed, and I ran out of butts on the way home from work where I would normally smoke . Decided I was going to see how long I could go before buying another pack. I had on a camping trip the following weekend and haven t since. The weed helped a lot. And some can argue its one ha it for another but I can t tell you how much better I feel. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Do not make deals with yourself in regards to slipping one here or there just don't do it. Altoids keeps a medium sized thing in your pocket for the weight, when you reach you get a treat and not a cigarette. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Don't have a spare pack lying around. I tried to quit multiple times and I would always have a spare one, I would tell myself just in case I had a really stressful day or was drinking with buddies or whatever reason. I would tell myself I'm just cutting down slowly, which was nice at the start but you have to make the jump and show commitment at some point. Once I made the decision not to buy anymore it became easy when I didn't have the temptation around. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Perhaps not the most experienced.

[SEP]', '[CLS] I smoked for over years. How I quit smoking cigarettes was to stop going out with friends that smoke and stop drinking any alcoholic beverages. Basically no more social fun with friends for awhile. [SEP]', '[CLS] Also think of new ways to stay busy. I d say this is going to change your life style for next months if you do decide to quit.

I did, and while I've started and stopped smoking a couple times since then. I typically have been non smoking for longer than smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I struggled for years to quit. Did cold turkey, acupuncture, and just cold hard will power. Nothing worked until I tried welbutran. It's an antidepressant that people were stopping without intending to stop.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] I quit years ago after I had a bad cold flu. I'd been trying to quit for years, but this time it stuck. I'll be smoke free for years in December. The key for me was actually wanting to quit. It's one thing to quit because it's healthy, or because someone wants you to, but it's a heck of a lot easier if you yourself actually want to quit.

Also, I don't really like lollipops, they last way too long, so it eventually got annoying enough to also quit the lollipops.

You get over the chemical addiction quickly but habit will get you. If you are like me you will be successful until you are at a bar with a friend who smokes.

Best advice I can give is keep yourself active when you quit. I don t mean physical exercise, though that wouldn t hurt, but do things around your house that will keep your mind off of having a cigarette long enough. Another thing that helped me continue not smoking is tracking the money I ve saved by not smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] Might be buried but what worked for me was limiting when I could have one. I started by not letting myself smoke at home because I was watching my infant son. If I stepped out for a smoke and locked myself out of the house with him inside I never would ha e forgiven myself so I only smoked at work. Then after getting used to that, I stopped buying them. This meant that if I wanted one at work I had to bum one. After a while I stopped being that guy who was always bu.ming smokes and just quit. That was the scariest step.

The first drag is like a bottle brush swabbing out your throat and lungs. Good time to go cold turkey. [SEP]', '[CLS] Did it right before I was going to have an incredibly busy two weeks. When the two weeks were over I had enough time sunk into it to keep going. Also, I have an app called smoke free . It logs how much time and money you ve saved. It s motivating. [SEP]', '[CLS] It also helped to actually want to quit. I d quit before, but my heart wasn t into it. When I finally did it I was sure. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I've been smoke free for years this coming November. This is how I did it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] First off Don't quit smoking. Stop . Quit has many negative connotations, so it's seen as a negative for some of us. Stop, on the other hand, is more neutral. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Second Don't keep a pack of smokes somewhere just in case. Leaving yourself an out is just admitting you may not succeed in stopping. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Get yourself through the first week. It's a bitch, but that's about when the worst of the withdrawal will occur. Take it day by day, and gut it out. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I suggest doing it cold turkey. The withdrawal has acted as a negative reinforcement against starting back up. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Once you're past the first week, find something to keep your hands busy. Adjust to the new reality that you have a sense of smell and taste, and focus on how awesome they are. Don't stay away from smokers  realize that that's how you smelled when you were a smoker.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] How I did it It was a huge burden to my wallet and the high was not even anything special, so I just stopped one day cold turkey. First days were annoying but not that hard as people make it to be. You just need to remember that you have free will and nothing is forcing you light that cigarette, it's all in your head, your body doesn't need it. Also, have a bunch of fruit with you and snack on that as a replacement . Just remeber that you are not an animal and don't let something retarded like nicotine grasp you, you're stronger than that.

I'd quit for a year once and had ONE drag off a cigarette and by the end of the day is bought my own pack. As for this time, been years this past July. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I had stopped twice before and started cigarettes again, finally quitting successfully on the third attempt. [SEP]', '[CLS] The reason for stopping has to be more important to you than the reason for continuing, and you have to resist the urge to join other smokers in a social context until you no longer actually crave one.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Realize you will have to fight off the temptation to smoke several times a day. Then learn to recognize the feeling or situation that leads to the rise in you considering and strategizing if,how, when, to light that cigarette. Then whenever that feeling or situation comes up train yourself to make that feeling trigger some other behavior that you choose. The things I used were to read pages of a book tie up leaders for fishing or if when I was at work just finish some other specific task. Might sound dumb but it worked for me. If you can completely distract your brain for minutes all or at least the worst of it passes. The key for me was learning to let the craving tell me to remember to do the other thing before giving too much attention to the craving itself. After a week or so the cravings diminish greatly.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] I switched to e cigs, but kept my habit the same. That is, I would go outside to smoke, even when it was cold, or at a bar, whatever, and I only used the e cigs, no more regular cigarettes. With the e cig, there was no way to know when I was done smoking, so I would just hang out for a bit, puffing on it, until I got bored or wanted to go back in or whatever. The number of times I would go out, and the length of time I was out there, gradually got less and less. Within a month or two I was completely done with smoking, and I haven't relapsed since, which has been about years or so. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Juul. I know it s not really quitting because I m vaping nicotine, but holy fuck if I m not healthier after not having a cig since March. I ve tried a bunch of different stuff over the years patch, vape, gum, lozenge but none of them worked. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Though e cigs have their own health concerns, I was able to use them to quit, because I could take a puff at any moment without needing to smoke an entire cigarettes worth of nicotine, and yet they were not pleasurable enough for me to keep doing it long term. One day I just said meh I don't need it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Ginger chew candies are great for knocking out the craving that creeps up in the back of your mouth. You know the one. [SEP]', '[CLS] I stopped saying that I had quit, and started thinking of myself as a smoker who takes breaks. The breaks became longer, and my self esteem didn t have to plummet if I had a smoke or two. I don t have to count days from zero all over again. [SEP]', '[CLS] In addition I was helped in a huge way by vaping. [SEP]', '[CLS] I don t smoke tobacco anymore. [SEP]', '[CLS] I gave up smoking cigarettes when my first child was expected. I ended up just smoking tobacco in other ways the odd cigar, but mostly lots of joints. Like or a night. European, we make joints with tobacco . [SEP]', '[CLS] I tried to give up a few times and I gave up for Lent a few times, but I was an addict. [SEP]', '[CLS] The solution for me was a paradigm shift, not a method. I did not try and give up smoking, I became an ex smoker. [SEP]', '[CLS] I used to have sex with pretty girls, now I am married and that is not something I do. yes it might be fun, but it is binary NOT SOMETHING I DO. [SEP]', '[CLS] The same is true of tobacco it is something I do not do. Think of it like being a vegan I am not or being allergic to peanuts. It is not a struggle although i miss it it is just something which is not for me. [SEP]', '[CLS] I do not really know how to verbalise the shift in mindset here, but it worked. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I started to quit one month ago and for me it's just a one day challenge. I mean, I'm just focus on not smoking during the current day, tomorrow we will see. And step by step, it's been a month and starting to feel a bit better. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I quit cold turkey but I didn't like it for a long time anymore before I quit. My partner wanted to quit and started vaping, slowing lowing the nicotine intake every some what months, eventuelly reached nicotine and than quit with vaping as wel. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Dipping. I hate it but its a lot cheaper than nicorrette and since I absolutely loathe it I can easily give it up. I use it as a step down while substituting more and more gum. [SEP]', '[CLS] . Moved into my own place, no roommates casually smoking around me to normalize it. If I was smoking it was purely my own intent and not a casual social thing we re all doing. This helped. [SEP]', '[CLS] . Started dating a non smoker. Cigarette breaks were limited to times when I wasn t around her. This significantly reduced triggers. [SEP]', '[CLS] BONUS just remembered, had a friend who I told he could take photos of me smoking to post on social media, because for the most part my Facebook was clean of any smoke photos as my grandparents and younger siblings would feel weird seeing that and the pressure of those photos made me uncomfortable. [SEP]', '[CLS] . Got caught trying to buy cigarettes by a coworker after telling them minutes prior that I was gonna quit that day. It embarrassed me enough to stay off for about days. [SEP]', '[CLS] . Girlfriend had a good job, I had food stamps. She set up weekly reward incentives learned from Freakinomics, financial rewards are a bigger incentive than the actual success of a specialty soda from my hometown, luxury coffees and beers and a final prize a PS which I would lose if started smoking again . [SEP]', '[CLS] So basically, the stars aligned for about months in a row and I was able to quit with the help of circumstance. [SEP]', '[CLS] The real mental game I had to play was being at bars with friends who smoke, and not joining them for a cigarette. I got real used to standing around people who were smoking, but I don t know how I did it besides telling myself it s ok to look weird not smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] I also found a coffee in my area that described itself as having nodes of tobacco and I mentally told myself it was like a cigarette replacement and I would enjoy that as a smoke break . [SEP]', '[CLS] Also began eating a lot of chocolate and beer to fill the void. Probably gained about pounds that year from increase in appetite and replacement vices.

[SEP]\", '[CLS] I tried to quit for years and only succeeded when I moved minutes away for work and hardly ever saw my friends, who were all smokers. [SEP]', '[CLS] I chewed on cinnamon sticks whenever I got a craving. They feel like a cigarette and have a little flavor. Plus they are hollow inside.

[SEP]\", '[CLS] Chantix. Destroyed my job, put me on edge, gave me a god complex, felt like I had the energy of a thousand suns, but hey, kicked a year habit, no cravings. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Chantix works if you don't actually have to be the person you were before you took it for awhile. If you need to be that responsible, clear thinking person, who isn't on a crusade to never back down, never surrender over everything and challenge your boss to fire your 'cock blocking assistant' maybe try one of these other methods. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Cold turkey has consistently shown to be the most effective way. Honestly if you get past a week the physical craving is gone. And after six months the psychological is pretty much gone. [SEP]', '[CLS] Smoke free here for years now. I had alot of help from taking Chantix but the biggest thing was accepting it as a change of habit, emotionally, socially and physically. [SEP]', '[CLS] Excercise, sleep and lots of fluids to help with the physical withdrawal symptoms. [SEP]', '[CLS] Mindfulness, or grounding technqiues to help with the mental emotional stress or withdrawal. Journaling also helps with tracking the positive effects that will gradually show up. Just remember to take it one day at a time with your emotions.

It took me tries before I finally made it past months of being smoke free I'm a lot less stressed, more productive, have a little more cash and smell good lol.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Vaping definitely helps. Eventually you get tired of vaping and then you are free again. [SEP]', '[CLS] Crippling existential dread about the meaninglessness of life and the cruel finality of death. [SEP]', '[CLS] Also a really low nicotine e cig for a few months was super helpful. [SEP]', '[CLS] I listened to the audiobook of Allen Carr s Stop Smoking, and it made all the difference. I needed to understand how the addiction was working in order to fight the urge and stay away. I quit before the audiobook was finished and never picked one up again. I celebrated five years this past May. [SEP]', '[CLS] I ve tried weening myself off of them and setting dates and all that, but ended up failing. The only thing that worked for me was quitting cold turkey. Was just randomly having a smoke break at work one day and quit mid cigarette. Just looked at the cigarette, said out loud I don t want to smoke anymore. I quit and grabbed the packs I had in my toolbox and gave them to a guy I worked with. Got the strangest look from the guy too lol. I ve smoked once since then and it has been about years. Probably not amazing advice and may not work for everybody, but it worked for me. [SEP]', '[CLS] If you re not fully committed to quitting, don t bother. You will just use any excuse you can come up with to rationalize having just this one . [SEP]', \"[CLS] Don't go into gas stations. Period. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Gas stations are pretty much the only place I ever bought cigarettes. Going in to pay for gas was basically just an excuse to also grab a pack or two. Honestly, there's no real reason for me to go inside of a gas station. I don't drink soda, eat candy, or have any interest in anything else in there. It's hard to go in and pay and just stare at that wall of cigarettes . [SEP]\", '[CLS] When I stopped doing that I was far less tempted to buy just one more pack. [SEP]', '[CLS] Just do it. Don t plan. Don t set a date. And do it cold turkey, otherwise you re just replacing one source of nicotine with another and ultimately prolonging the process. Weed helps too. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Instead of smoking, don't smoke. NEXT. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Have some self discipline. If you slip up and buy a pack, when you light the first one up and start feeling guilty, through the rest of the pack in the trash immediately. Don t turn one mistake into twenty. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This isn't the answer a lot of people are looking for but it worked for me after being a pack and a half a day smoker for years. Be aware that you need to both break a physical addiction as well as the mental addiction to the habits that you have developed. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The best way to quit smoking is to quit smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Vapes, patches, gums, extend your addiction and after a few weeks months of your cravings not going away you'll get discouraged and go right back to the pack because you only tried to address the physical side. I use the word BREAK intentionally because that's what you have to do. You need to BREAK the habit, not ease yourself out of it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Educate yourself on the symptoms of withdrawal and the timeline of how they go away and managing them becomes much easier. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Tomorrow morning don't have a cigarette. Next time you have an urge  don't have a cigarette. It gives you a headache Take an advil. Your mood starts fly all over the place Take a walk. Understand that after a week when you wake up without a smokers cough you'll still have a lot of other symptoms but be happy you made it that far  and don't have a cigarete. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I was never a heavy smoker, like cigarettes a day at the very most. To quit, I used the patch. Several failed attempts with the gum, chantix omg my stomach , and other things like toothpicks, etc  I started with the level patch for three months, then moved to the level patch for three more months, and then because I couldn't go without I started cutting the level patch into quarters. After a few weeks of this, I was an ex smoker this happened in . [SEP]\", '[CLS] It s been about years now cold turkey. It was and I wanted to be warm, I only smoked outside. [SEP]', '[CLS] Never picked it back up because the worst of it was during Christmas and I was busy. It slipped my mind and I just never picked it back up. The smell is enough to keep me away now. [SEP]', '[CLS] Try to rewire your thoughts so that not having a cigarette becomes the reward. We all know that cigarettes are enjoyable because they exploit the reward mechanisms in your brain. When you crave one and make a decision to not act on that craving, give yourself a mental pat on the back for making that responsible decision. When you have your next craving seconds later, do it again. Try to keep it so that not having a cigarette is a good thing instead of just another thing stressing you out. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Associate the act with something you aren't planning on doing anymore. So stop smoking during breakfast or lunch or whatever and associate only smoking at a specific place, like your job. I did this and then when I quit the job I quit the smokes too. Cold turkey never looked back. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit numerous times before finally getting it right. There are many things you can do to help ease the suckiness, distractions, etc, but the thing you need most IMO is resolve. [SEP]', '[CLS] A friend at the time had gone through AA recently and I asked him how he gave up alcohol and he said that he just told himself he was never going to drink, no excuses. Bad day, death in the family, good day, I ve been good for XX weeks so I can probably have just one the list is endless. [SEP]', '[CLS] Basically my problem was that I kept convincing myself I had my addiction under control. I never did and never could, so once I realized that the only way to quit was to never, EVER, EVER FUCKING EVER smoke even one teeny cigarette, I was able to do it. It took me years but it s been years now. [SEP]', '[CLS] This is what worked for me. [SEP]', '[CLS] Break up with crazy stressful ex. [SEP]', '[CLS] Eat baby carrots. Unlike some snacks there s no salt and you will get sick before they make you fat. But great to give your hand s and mouth something to do. [SEP]', '[CLS] Listen to music you can sing too. [SEP]', '[CLS] I laid out a plan for quitting. Before quitting I went on the American Cancer Society website and American Heart Lung Association to really learn about smoking related cancers. I read all their advice for quitting and what studies showed in terms of long term quitting success. I learned that nicotine levels return to normal after about week of quitting, after that, it was all mental. This empowered me. I learned that smoking can double the risk of infertility issues for women and my biggest dream in life was to be a mom, so this became my mantra and motivation. [SEP]', '[CLS] I picked a Quit Date March , , switched to cigarettes I hated for the last month, began to wean down the number of cigarettes to the bare minimum my two hardest cigarette times to quit were before bed and driving to work , I bought low cal candy to distract my mouth at craving times, bought healthy snacks to eat instead and bought a gym membership to combat any weight gain. It is hard to smoke and run at the same time. [SEP]', '[CLS] On my Quit Day I asked for family and friend support, took it easy and rewarded myself with a manicure. Every day the first week I gave myself a small reward, this wired my brain for positive association with not smoking. After the first week of success, I rewarded myself every Friday if I hadn t smoked all week. I would get a new book, go for a hike, get a massage, a dinner out, coffee with a friend, etc. All healthy and happy rewards. [SEP]', '[CLS] It worked. I ve never looked back. [SEP]', '[CLS] You have to commit yourself. You have to want it. You cannot do it for your spouse, your kids, your parents, your pets , you have to do it for YOU. You have to want it.

Drink some whiskey Want one. Bang my wife Want one. But I don t smoke them anymore because I decided not to. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Just do it. It's not that hard. At least not as hard as everyone says it is. If you want to do it, you'll do it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Reduce to quit. First day half the amount you smoke then a couple days later half that. Before you know it you'll have it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Dip all of your cigarettes in pcp.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] I've been quit a little over a year at this point, it sucks. I want one everysingle day, and about once a month that's all I want for an entire day. But the longer it goes the easier it is. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The smell has started to become sort of repulsive as well, except for every now and then someone will fire up that good one out of a pack. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Moral of the story is, it's not fun, and you're still gonna want to smoke after, but for me I'm far to stubborn to go back. After as much as it sucked quitting. [SEP]\", '[CLS] You have to want to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That thing they say, You have to want to quit. is not just BS. It's the biggest part of it. My wife has been the only person who has asked me to quit. [SEP]\", '[CLS] She wanted me to quit before we got married. I stopped for about a week.

Before, I could only go smoke on break and during lunch when I could get outside to do so. At the locator job, I could smoke in my truck, smoke anytime I wanted. That new found freedom, plus the stress of literally losing of my previous pay, bills, etc I literally went from half a pack a day to a pack a day in two months. Wife started to notice and wasn't happy. She'd say something about it, I'd get annoyed and go smoke another one or three. She finally quit asking me to quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I say all of that b c I didn't want to quit, and that's why it never worked. One day, I just decided that I couldn't smoke for the rest of my life. I always had a lot of reasons why I should quit kids, wife didn't like it but tolerated it, health, Dr. said it was a good idea, commercials said it was a good idea, even more sexy time with wife if I didn't smell and taste like an ashtray, etc. but none of it really mattered until sometime in June of . I don't know what changed my mind, but all of a sudden those reasons made sense and I wanted to quit. It wasn't like I suddenly loved my wife and kids more, or I cared more about my health and the health of those around me. I don't know exactly how to explain it, just one day I was like, I want to stop smoking so that I can do things for people I care about. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I used the patches. Bought them over the counter at Wal Mart. I slipped a couple of times during the first two weeks, but smoked my very last cigarette on June , . It gets easier as time goes on. I also developed a new found love for sunflower seeds. You will gain weight. As a utility locator, I walked miles a day. I weighted lbs when I stopped smoking, and within a year I weighed lbs. Now that I sit on my ass all day again, I weigh  I need to exercise more. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I still work with people who smoke, but the funny thing is, now I don't like the smell of it. Before, I'd see someone smoking IRL, or on TV or in a game and I'd have to go have one. Now, I'm not really disgusted by it, but I don't have that urge anymore. I see someone smoking now and think, damn, I wasted a lot of money. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] According to the app I have on my phone, I quit June , .

It satisfies the oral fixation which is the secondary addiction aside from nicotene.

Most people don't drink enough water but especially smokers as it saps the hydration from your body as well. Water.

I noticed that most of my urges were habit related light up while waking to the bus stop, light up on the balcony before going to sleep, light up when you start arranging the books. When I moved to a new city, I quit. Since the environment was new, I was not doing most of the things that I was doing out of habit earlier. There was no walk to the bus stop, no balcony, no bookshelf. Without the triggers, it was easier to resist. Plus, there were so many othee things to do which took my mind off the urge to smoke.

After a couple years, ten years, maybe forever, you will still have cravings, but they will be so infrequent it's actually kind of interesting from a psychological perspective when they present themselves. While unmistakably a cigarette craving, it will feel so unusual at that point that you can easily isolate and ignore it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] For me it took a few tries. First a week or . Then a month or then I just stopped. I got into the routine having a cigarette at work breaks. While driving etc so I just learned to find a new habit in those times.

I found both of those methods just made my addiction linger.

I got the highest milligram of both, and I used a patch a day for a week, then instead of buying the lower mg, I just cut them in half, and then quarters. With the patches, they take a while to work, so it's best to put them on at night. That was where I struggled, because I liked showering in the morning and had to switch to night. I chewed the gum with the patches, which you're not supposed to, but it helped with sudden urges. Then, after I quit the patches I chewed the gum for another week or so. Have no desire to smoke again, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't cross my mind often.

Vape as much as it takes to sate your craving without having a cigarette. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] . Have a good vape kit, and a good backup kit ideally they will be identical so you can share batteries chargers coils wicks . Buying everything you need at once complete vape kits, juice, replacement coils might cost you or more, but it pays for itself in a month or less, because you're not buying cigarettes. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] . Have a plan. Say you're going to start with mg ml juice, you're going to cut your nicotine by a third every month. So after a month on mg ml, cut it to mg ml juice. Another month, mg ml, and then maybe go to mg ml and finally go to zero mg ml. At each transition, it's ok to vape more, and you'll eventually settle into it after a couple days. For me, this part was actually really easy. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] . Once you get to zero mg ml for a couple weeks, you are completely off nicotine. Keep using the vape, but start occasionally leaving it in the car when you go out and see how it goes. If you need it, it's there, but you won't. [SEP]\", '[CLS] As far as a starter vape kit, you can check out r electronic cigarette for recommendations. I have been out of the scene for a couple years, but my recommendation is get a simple kit with a built in battery that you charge just like a cell phone. Something with a tank that you can easily refill and coils you can easily replace. Good brand names that I remember are Innokin, SMOK, Aspire, eLeaf, although I am sure there are new brands on the scene. [SEP]', '[CLS] Something like this would be perfect IMO https wwwmyvaporstore com Innokin Coolfire Mini with Zenith D MTL p ink cfm .htm [SEP]', \"[CLS] Remember, you'll want TWO of these. The backup kit is super important. Keep it charged and ready to fill all the time. When you change coils and wash your tank, fill the other one and use that one for a while. That way, if something happens to your main kit battery dies, it gets stolen, you leave it at the bar, drop it and break the tank, whatever you aren't forced to go buy a shitty Juul at the gas station or even worse, a pack of cigarettes. [SEP]\", '[CLS] If you have any questions, feel free to PM me. I got into building my own coils and mixing my own juice, so I can probably answer it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Gum did it for me. Not even nicotine gum just regular old orbit or eclipse. I am completely addicted to gum now but atleast it s somewhat of a healthier alternative . [SEP]', \"[CLS] Sunflower seeds. I think that mainly worked for me because I chose chew as an alternative and had to quit that, but just the motion of bringing something to your mouth and keeping it occupied works. Also, don't vape. [SEP]\", '[CLS] You have to absolutely be ready to quit Just do the calculation of financial benefits of quitting. A pack a day in Texas is about Multiply that by At least a month. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Then think about the health benefits of quitting. You breath easier. Your taste of food gets better I noticed after I quit how good things taste now Which in turn caused me to gain a little weight because your metabolism slows down after a change like that to your body You know you're less susceptible to viruses and bacteria if you quit because your lungs, heart, asophagus, etc won't be trying to regenerate themselves from the damage of smoking. I don't even have to mention the long term health effects. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Lastly, and not really most importantly, think about the social benefits. It seemed to me that it was beginning to be a pain in the ass to be a smoker. Most restaurants and bars don't allow it. Most people don't want smoke in their homes or cars. Most people don't want smoking around their kids or especially babies. Your days of stopping the car to smoke on long trips and standing in the rain to get a quick smoke in are over. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My point is to REALLY be ready to quit Because you're not trying to convince other people You're trying to convince yourself Don't try to lie to yourself It's pointless and redundant. So when you know you're ready, JUST QUIT COLD TURKEY It's the only way Don't vape or use patches and gum. Don't dip or chew or switch to cigars only Those are just other habits youre trading cigarettes for None of them are beneficial None JUST. QUIT. [SEP]\", '[CLS] That was literally the one thing I did different that worked. Just don t tell anyone that you re quitting. Wait for them to bring it up. Delay that gratification as long as you can. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I used the nicotine patch the Walmart brand. I wore it , only taking it off when I showered. It takes the urge away, but I had trouble with the after meal smoke. I smoked with the patch on, didn't get the buzz, so it was easier to eventually give them up. The patch deals with the addiction. The habit is a bit harder. I took up doing crossword puzzles to keep my hands busy. I also didn't follow the time frame for switching strengths. I was paranoid that I would relapse if I went to a weaker patch. I did it in my own time and have been smoke free for yrs. This was my second attempt at quitting. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Smoke free for almost years. Chantix got me through the first month and made smoking positively disgusting. I had to bail after the month because my stomach didn't react to the pill well, but after that first month it wasn't too bad. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] One mental exercise that got me through a lot of cravings was to mentally tally up how many days it had been since my last cigarette if I got hit with a particularly strong urge. It had the pronged effect of temporarily distracting me for a minute or two while I counted days while laying out exactly what I was going to be losing if I cracked. Once that number got up over or days, failure wasn't an option anymore. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] According to my dad, it's moving somewhere with cold winters. He quit about three months into the Michigan winter after we moved from Florida. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] If that doesn't get through to you then you're trying too hard. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Get a deep cleaning at the dentist. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I started smoking when I was . By the time I was in my late 's a pack could last me from days to a week more if I wasn't drinking . And I was mostly using e cigs, those little single black ones that lit up at the end. I hadn't been to the dentist in over a decade and when I finally worked up the nerve to go at , the cleaning this woman gave me had me gripping the arm rests like I was on a plane with engine trouble. I could see flecks of blood flying out of my mouth. Still, my mouth felt so good. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] When she was done she asked Do you smoke I said I think I just quit and I was joking but I didn't touch another cigarette again. I probably would have slowed to a stop eventually but that dentist visit did it for me in one go. years of smoking, done. I just turned last week, so it's been years and I don't miss it at all and I can't stand the way smokers smell and feel so much shame over knowing I reeked like that for so long . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My husband quit because I told him I wouldn't marry him unless he did. He misses it a lot though he smoked way more than I did . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Edit I'd say try to stay away from your triggers in the beginning. I could go through a whole pack in one night if I was getting drunk, so I just drank a lot less and less often until I was sure I was done with it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I divided it into steps. First I tackled my addiction to the breaks that cigarettes provided me, then the oral fixation, then the actual nicotine addiction. [SEP]', '[CLS] I started by transitioning from cigarettes to vaping. This meant I could Vape inside which help me get over the feeling of having to go outside for a break to smoke a cigarette. at first I missed the brakes but I realized after a while how much time they took out of my life. [SEP]', '[CLS] After I was vaping for a couple months and have gotten over the withdrawal of cigarettes I transitioned to the patches. that way I still have nicotine in my system but I could get over the oral fixation. It only took me a couple weeks to stop chewing my fingers off and by the time I got to the lowest level patch I knew I could do it. The first two or three days without the patch was hard because I had no nicotine in my system but I had been gradually reducing the level of nicotine using the patches so my body and mind could handle it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Quit cold turkey realizing the truth is that you won t die from withdrawal you re actually getting healthier by quitting , you don t need cigarettes to handle stressful situations, you won t smell like an ashtray, and you re saving tons of money. [SEP]', '[CLS] It s not serious advice, but my mom quit after getting knocked up. I was an accident, so my mom quit cold turkey when she found out she was pregnant. [SEP]', '[CLS] Don t get knocked up, but she says it s the best thing that happened to her bc she quit that and drinking cold turkey. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Be sure you actually really want to quit, that's the most important thing. If you're half assing it then it will never work. [SEP]\", '[CLS] For the first weeks stay away from any triggers you have, i quit drinking and going out for example since i mostly smoked when i drank. I would get home, exercise, eat and go to bed earlier than usual. Take yourself out of your routine for a bit. Quitting is only really difficult for the first weeks. [SEP]', '[CLS] I didn t smoke but my dad a few weeks ago flat out quit. I came home from school and he told me to go out and buy lobster tails to mark the event that he quitted smoking. His reason was witnessing his brother passing away due to lung cancer and seeing his brothers wife and kids suffer the lost. I guess he doesn t want my mom and I to go through the same thing. It was a big decision on his part and I am really proud. [SEP]', '[CLS] What helped me quit is that I had switched from store bought packs to roll your own with less tasty tobacco. Once I got sick of smoking, the harshness of the cigs was enough of a turnoff that it was relatively easy to taper off and finally go cold turkey. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I wasn't a heavy smoker to begin with, though just or cigarettes per day. And I had a few setbacks when I gave into cravings and bought myself those flavored cigarillos. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Cold Turkey and pure will. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Survive the first two weeks and you'll be shocked at how much you don't want a cigarette. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I quit days ago and it's the best thing I ever did. Now, anytime I smell a smoke I'm disgusted. I don't necessarily mind it, but it's just not for me anymore. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I managed to do it in years with vaping. [SEP]', '[CLS] Buy one of the proper mods, that makes good cloud and add a lot of nicotine to it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Keep at it for as long as it takes for you to start hating cigarettes. [SEP]', '[CLS] For me it was months when the smell of tobacco started to stink. [SEP]', '[CLS] Slowly reduce the nicotine in it as time goes on. [SEP]', '[CLS] The next big jump is going from little nicotine to no nicotine. [SEP]', \"[CLS] After months of vaping no nicotine I started to forget my vape and didn't care I did. [SEP]\", '[CLS] P.S Try not to gain weight. [SEP]', '[CLS] Heavy discount on my life insurance. [SEP]', \"[CLS] get a smartphone app that tracks your smoke free days. It was really helpful for me to see my progress. After a couple weeks smoke free, I didn't want to break that streak. [SEP]\", '[CLS] just fucking do it. everyone that tells you how hard it is to quit smoking wants to sell you something. seriously. listen to the language used by companies selling the pill or the patch. [SEP]', \"[CLS] oh it's soooo hard to quit smoking. try this magical remedy to increase your chances of quitting. the side effects are brutal but don't worry about that. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Move to a location with horrible air quality Feel the sharp pain in your chest that comes with every drag. Take notice of the slightly blood clotty crap that you're coughing from your lungs. That's what finally made me quit after years of smoking. It wasn't intended but it definitely motivated me to never smoke again. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Hey ex smokers whadda ya think of this. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I smoke around king sized smokes a day. My woman is due in April and we always agreed that I would quit before we had a kid. I love smoking it's literally my favorite activity. Ive been an over two packs a day guy since . I want to quit before so I've been reducing my smokes by a smoke or two a day. Do you guys think this will work for me I know I can't do it cold turkey. I tried in the summer and lasted less than a day. I've tailored my life to make my smoking addiction easy. I work out doors and do a lot of driving for work. Every thing people have told me so far has failed to phase me. It gets super cold here in winter, I just convinced my self that I don't mind. I spend dollars every ciggarettes, convinced myself that I would just spend the money poorly any way. I'm over weight and athsmatic and was that way before I started so the health effects don't bother me too much cause I was always out of breath quick. Some times I think smoking is part of my personality, part of what makes me,me. I like having a reason to go outside during almost any event. I wonder if smoking is why I'm a patient person. I wonder if I'd still love my job if I couldn't smoke. I wonder if I'd still be funny, or if I'd be so friendly if I didn't smoke. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Do you guys think I can quit if I go slowly or am I better off getting an RX I tried vaping a couple years ago, that wasn't an improvement I Vaped like ml a day at mg and ended up getting really sick I don't know if it was from the vape or not but I can't handle it any more. I like the gum and use it when I fly or when I know I won't be able to smoke for a few hours. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'm terrified of chantix, I've heard of so many people having problems in real life because of their dreams and I don't want to not be me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Bottom line I guess is I have to quit. I don't know if any smoker ever wants to quit and I've given up on the idea that I'd ever want to quit. I don't think I'd ever be ready to say fuck smoking, or that I hate it. I've always liked the smell of burning tobacco, and I don't think that's going to go away. But I hope that by slowly reducing the amount I smoke I'll be able to cut it out maybe with the help of gum before the end of the year. Please let me know if any one here quit that way and if it worked. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Not me, but I do have a good experience. [SEP]', '[CLS] I had a customer who was trying to quit. He quit the night before. Woke up and he felt great. Went to work, went to do some calls. Suddenly he realized that out of habbit, he had pulled out a cig, lit it, and was smoking as he was talking.

Yes you will get cravings but just say no I am done. That's how I quit. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Whenever I wanted to smoke I d chew gum instead. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Hopefully I don't get too buried in this. Here are the main points that I felt help me when I quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Try to remove the association of stress smoke break. If you can avoid this relation, then when you have a rough phone call, or get bad news, you're willpower will be at it's lowest, and you don't want to cave in right then. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Don't buy them. If you don't have any, you can't smoke any. I also hated bumming borrowing smokes from other people, so if I didn't have them, then I'm not going to have one.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] Smelling stuff. Give it a few weeks. You're going to start to smell a lot of stuff. Your sense of smell sucks right now, and when that comes back you'll notice a lot of things that you never could. Especially how much another smoker actually smells. With any luck, this will gross you out. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'd say within the first week of no smoking, you'll start to notice that you aren't coughing up lung butter daily. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] You will have dreams of smoking. These can often be disturbing, and I can still recall one from years ago that when I woke up, I checked the pockets to my jacket and was shocked that I didn't have a pack of smokes in there. The dream was so vivid that I had been smoking again. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Months and even years after. You will get some pretty out of the blue cravings to smoke again. Resist it, they will slow down to become pretty rare. [SEP]', \"[CLS] People recommend food nuts to help with cravings, but this is also something that leads people to think that smoking skinny . You can easily get yourself into a bad weight gain habit if you aren't careful. Instead of sunflower seeds or nuts, do strawberries, apples, pears, or even sugarless gum. This will keep your hands busy, and mouth chewing to help get you through the bad part. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I had quit for over a decade, and years ago I started having a few cigars once in a while . Next thing I'm getting Colts for cigars instead of nice cubans, but I'm smoking one or two almost daily. That quickly turned up to daily, and times, and next thing you know a pack of colts a day. I get a chest cold , and I can't get rid of a damn cough for weeks, just to get another. Finally realized I was being dumb, quit those nasty things, and no more issues.

However, when i became determined to swap I had to find the nicotine level I was used to. Started at mg of nic and have dialed it down to . But when I found that sweet spot at I had no cravings for a cigarette. My brother and mother still smoke so I tried a cig about a week into vaping and put it out immediately.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Been almost ten years, and have not looked back since. [SEP]', '[CLS] Now when I smell smoke, I almost gag. So gross smelling to me now. [SEP]', '[CLS] I weaned off them over several months. The less I smoked the less I liked smoking. I hate the taste and smell now. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I didn't have any help. I went from a pack, to half a pack, to just a few a day, then thought, why am I still doing this and stopped one day. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Identify your triggers and eliminate them at least until you are fully over smoking. For me, it was drinking alcoholic beverages. I cut back my drinking significantly at first and then completely eliminated until I kicked smoking. The last time I tried smoking while drinking after not being addicted to cigarettes at least years ago , it felt awful. Now, I can drink alcoholic beverages with zero interest in smoking. In fact, it's also caused me to drink less, because drinking doesn't feel as good now without the cigarettes. Now I'll drink alcoholic beverages only in moderation and only if they taste good. Sometimes coffee is a trigger for people. Stop drinking it or switch to another form of caffeine. Sometimes its friends. If it's a friend, you need to spend less time with those friends or ask those friends to not smoke around you and do things with each other that aren't conducive to smoking. Make smoking inconvenient for yourself by staying away from places that allow smoking. If you smoke in your house, make it a rule that you can't smoke indoors. For me, living in Minnesota really worked because it would be so damn cold out that you didn't want to deal with it. You need to make strict rules and follow them. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Also know that most people don't smoke and that they can smell smoke on you and in your house, even if you can't smell it. It smells worse than you think. You don't want people to think you're smelly. A lot of people will also think that you're stupid trashy for smoking. Most people don't know that it's not because you're stupid trashy, it's just easy to become addicted to and extremely hard to quit. You'll also start to look and sound worse sullen, wrinkly, raspy and people will know you're a smoker. If the stuff I mentioned above doesn't work, then maybe the public shame factor will. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Think of all of that money you're blowing on cigarettes. I remember feeling rich after I stopped smoking. Right now, you are wasting a ton of money on something that isn't even worth the cost and will cost you even more down the line. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Finally, you have to want to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Keep reminding yourself you can't afford it anymore and it will kill you. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I got the e cig before everything was called vape this or that and gradually reduced the nicotine content over the course of about a year and then just gave it up. [SEP]', '[CLS] It can only be cold turkey. I took a smoking cessation class, and the accountability was key to getting me starting. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Expect to gain weight it'll be OK. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I had to stop watching movies from the s 's. All the smoking got to me I even had to stop watching AbFab for the same reason. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Long term you will cheat. You will go through times where you pick it up again for a few months then you quit again etc  Eventually you learn to fear withdrawal more then crave the cigarettes. That said, it took ten years for the cravings to go away completely. [SEP]', '[CLS] I suggest you look at pictures of lungs that have been affected by smoking related diseases. COPD, Emphysema, and of course cancer. That is reality, and it is a natural progression from smoking. Sure, there are those people who are and smoked packs a day unfiltered since they were , but they are the genetic freaks. That is not the normal course. [SEP]', '[CLS] Good luck and stay strong. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The physical addiction will go away if you quit smoking for weeks. The mental addiction stays for much longer, and you essentially have to forget why smoking is desirable. I'm at about months without smoking and still sort of have the desire, but it's much weaker than when I was months in. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'm trying to avoid casual smoking, so that I will hopefully get rid of all desire to smoke. I guess that's my advice, don't slip up and eventually you'll forget the desire after a year or two. I think I've reached the point where alcohol no longer increases the craving, and that's huge for me. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I had tried quitting twice but failed. Being in France did not help. And I really wanted to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] In a last ditch attempt gave control to a friend to slap me if I smoked. And we re honest to each other. I was to do the same to him if he drank more than two glasses of anything. The fear and embarrassment of getting slapped in public saved me. Quit cold turkey. I although got two chances of slapping him. [SEP]', '[CLS] Not been long but it s been four months and going strong. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Smoked for a little over years. Tried many times to quit. Chantix worked once but after months went over to best friends place for a party. Friend smoked and the drinking ended that months. On one attempt to quit, I've gotten home and realized only then I had bought a pack at the gas station I always use on the way home. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Not everyone is able to do what I did and move out of the country but I believe it comes down to one thing. Habits. The addiction and withdrawal part only lasts few days. What messes you up is the habit it anything person that reminds you of it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Lighter in the pocket, yup. [SEP]', '[CLS] Stop at same store on the way home, always get a pack right. [SEP]', \"[CLS] When I moved a got rid of everything before the flight and didn't tell anyone I smoked when I got here. Made it so easy. Five years now not so much as a twitch. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This will probably get buried, but for me it was when my friend started realizing he needed to quit. We had started smoking at basically the same time, just for fun at first, but over time it got to the point where he was starting to get pretty substantial cravings whenever he went without a smoke. I was lucky that I hadn t developed those cravings yet, but it was a wake up call that I needed to stop before I did. [SEP]', '[CLS] Even without the physiologic addiction though, quitting was still tough. I m a pretty anxious person, and without meaning to I had let cigarettes become one of the main ways I dealt with stress. Smoking gave me an excuse to take a break and have some personal time at a point in my life when I didn t feel comfortable asking for either of those things. Also, being able to do something with my hands was a great way to vent some of my pent up nervous energy. Ultimately, it was a combo of therapy and altoids smalls that helped me quit. I was able to replace at least some of what cigarettes gave me with the mints, and the therapy helped with some of the underlying issues that made smoking such a tempting stress reliever to begin with. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My last cigarette was september th. At a pack a day, for a pack, I've saved . [SEP]\", '[CLS] Monetary gain was a huge motivator for me. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I smoked cigarettes for years before I decided to try to quit. I succeeded even though I lived with my girlfriend who smoked half a pack a day. after quitting too quickly cold turkey and relapsing a handful of times, I decided to take it slower on the next try. I gradually switched from cigarettes to a vape pen over a couple of weeks. at first, i didn't change my smoking habits, just added the vape. I would still take time to go sit on the porch and vape because on previous quitting attempts, I had missed the ritual of taking minutes to sit quietly outside. before long though, being able to vape and get my nicotine fix indoors got me more hooked on vaping than cigs after a few days it was winter and I lived in a rental . at first my nicotine consumption went up bc I was vaping all day, but I stuck with my plan. rather than focusing on what I couldn't have no more cigarettes today , I focused on an alternate replacement that I could have, that still gave me the buzz I was after, and was still enjoyable to use. once I got used to reaching for the vape instead of the cigarettes when I got a craving, it was super easy to gradually taper off of my nicotine addiction. every time I refilled the tank on the pen, I added a few drops of flavorless, nicotine free vaping liquid, then a few more the next time. first drops, then , and so on. after a couple of weeks there was hardly any nicotine in the tank, and also hardly any flavor. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] the reduction of nicotine wasn't dependent on a change in behavior. I allowed myself to vape as much as I wanted and still gave myself quiet outside time. it didn't feel like I was suddenly missing something. I didn't have to change my habits much and I didn't get hit by intense cravings. vaping just got slowly, steadily less fun and gave me less of a buzz as I added more and more nicotine free liquid. I guess the key for me was to quit gently and gradually. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] kept smoking, added vaping, phased out smoking, gradually diluted vaping liquid containing nicotine with nicotine free vaping liquid. haven't smoked in years. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I started drinking lots of seltzer. The bite of it feels sort of like the feeling you get in your throat from cigarettes. Shop rite sells ginger seltzer and it s perfect for this. [SEP]', '[CLS] Everything you do is worthless unless you truly believe you can quit. You can do it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Decide that you really want to commit never to smoke again. That's the biggest one. Practice saying no to yourself when you have urges. It gets easier with practice. Realize and admit to yourself that there is no such thing as just this one cigarette. It will snowball. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Think about how bad you smell to others when you smoke, and call cigarettes stinkies. Also start using a vape instead and ween yourself off if cold turkey doesn't work. Cigarettes have more than just nicotine that is addictive, often its harder to quit those than the nicotine itself. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Nothing seems to work. My mother, however, found a sure fire method of quitting smoking she developed an allergy to tobacco and got very sick every time she tried to smoke. I'm still waiting for that top happen. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I switched it with Epok, a purely nicotine snus with no tobacco. Yes I'm scandinavian. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Pick a day to quit where you'll be busy and stressed. If you relapse and buy a pack, smoke one cigarette and then destroy the rest of the pack. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I only smoked for years but I just started smoking more weed. Want a smoke Smoke a bowl. Want a smoke after your bowl Smoke another bowl. Want a smoke after that bowl Go to smoke another bowl and realize you're too stoned to smoke another bowl, so you turn on a video game or something. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Buy a new car, your monthly smoking habit pays off your monthly payment, back in I purchase a new SUV and my monthly was , I was spending per month on cigs, I've quit a couple of times but this made it stick. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I switched to vaping. I was already at the point where I couldn't stand to smoke another cigarette but my brain wouldn't let me go without the nicotine. I switched to a vape pen with mg nic. It was a terrible experience but ultimately helped me quit. I would sit around playing skyrim for hours on end and vape to my hearts content. I didn't have to step outside and it didn't make me feel like I was sucking car exhaust and coughing until I puked every morning. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I went a little overboard because I would lose track of how much I was vaping and my brain loved all the nicotine. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I started feeling sick but I figured it was unrelated and kept on vaping like a madman. I got worse until eventually I couldn't get out of bed. I blacked out and woke up days later. I gave myself nicotine poisoning and possibly almost died. After that I have never touched either cigarettes or vapes and I have absolutely no desire to. [SEP]\", '[CLS] My advice is to switch to a less harmful nicotine delivery system but do not go overboard. Switch to vaping with a LOW nicotine dosage or get gum or a patch and ween yourself off. You will feel so much better after you quit and the thought of smoking a cigarette now makes me feel sick. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Not a smoker, but my buddy is. He says Chantix I think that's what it's called is working for him. He's one month in. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Convert to e cigs then try if you still want to. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Buy a vaporizer. Not a juul. And legit one. I use the revenger x by Vaporesso. But i've had alot of different ones. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I smoked for over years. You won't like it at first. You will probably go back to smokes for like a month or two. But eventually you will notice three things, when you do switch. You will have a lot more money,cigarettes will get less and less appealing, and you won't smell. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Like now, I might have one when I'm drunk, but it just isn't satisfying anymore. And you can ween down the nicotine quite easily as it feels more or less the exact same if its mg nicotine or nicotine if you ween . I use all melon naked juice because the taste is neutral. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'm from Tennessee. All my friends are smokers. The only ones who have successful quit, have all done the vap route. Its the only one I see work.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Take deep breaths like you are smoking a cigarette. Hold the clean air in and release as if it was a cigarette. Helped me relax immediately. Also if you fall back, let it go, and just get back on immediately. It s tough but you can do it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'VE TOLD FOLKS TOO. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I literally pretend when nobody is lookinga round to smoke a cigarette, even going as far as using my right hand i'm left handed, but i smoked with my right , and taking a deep breath. This literally felt like of the smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] also, don't hang out with your smoking friends, and finally, quit drinking also. Your gaurds will go down if you drink. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Listen to YouTube hypnotherapy stuff, it s more guided meditation but helps. [SEP]', '[CLS] Go cold turkey, no gum etc, I tried many times before cracking this. [SEP]', '[CLS] Chew gum after meals and when you crave it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Aka don t give up, your cravings go away after months mostly and after a year almost completely.

From this moment on, you can't smoke. If you had quit a year ago you would have been done for a year now, this time next year you are going to be happy you didn't let it go another year. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Don't quit. Don't plan to quit. Because you already smoked your last cigarette last night. You'll never smoke another one. You're not going to quit, because you've already quit. Smoke free months. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I went the e cig path after years of smoking. I got a POS for my first one, but then finally got a decent setup for my nd one. That was years ago. My last analogue cig was almost years ago I'd occasionally have one after a REALLY rough day . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I still use my e Cig, so I haven't quit but I'm healthier in general. I can breath easier, I have a bit more energy, coughing spasms are gone. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I found I had to make a mental change to make it take effect too. I was in a crappy place in my life, and this was one of a few changes I made to try and better myself all around the same time. [SEP]', '[CLS] It sounds super captain obvious y looking back, but in addition to a cessation aid patch I had to start thinking of myself as a non smoker. Smoking becomes such a part of your identity, something people associate with you, and changing that behavior entails changing your conception of who you are, and how you fill the moment to moment windows that would usually result in going out to have a smoke. [SEP]', \"[CLS] More than once I had an internal conversation where I'd be thinking Hmm, I could go for a cigarette right now , before catching myself and thinking Wait, no I don't I'm a non smoker. The patch helped a lot too. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I tapered off little by little. Went from a pack a day to half a pack a day, to to none. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I quit cold turkey in after smoking for years. Went to a party one night and smoked too much. Woke up next morning with bad hangover and shot lungs. Didn't have a smoke that day. Woke up the next day and decided to not have a smoke that day either and see how long I can make it. Haven't had a cigarette since August . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Just do it, yo. Take it one day at a time. Don't be thinking about the next day. When you feel like having a cigarette, just don't have one. That's my advice, lol. It's not that hard. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Cut the caffeine until the cravings aren't tearing you apart anymore. Caffeine intensified the cravings and once I stopped that, it was easier. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Don't force yourself to just quit one day while still smoking frequently. You'll crave that last cigarette you didn't have and are more likely to cave. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Just smoke less over time. It can be a month, months, doesn't matter as long as you're smoking less. You can do this by being conscious of when and why you smoke, and get stricter with yourself over time. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Eventually cigarettes will start tasting like shit, because they do.

[SEP]', '[CLS] days smoke free today. I take mg a day. [SEP]', '[CLS] You gotta quit every habit. I quit for months and hadn t had any but I went back to school and found out I hadn t quit the after class habit yet One step at a time. [SEP]', '[CLS] Deep breaths and lots of food. [SEP]', '[CLS] Want to quit. I mean really want to quit. The will power to not feel like shit was my driving force and the only way I got through it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Fisherman's Friend It's a brand of throat lozenge that is outrageously menthol. Eating one after every meal and as soon as I got in the truck curbed my cravings pretty quick.

I want to let it be known that the urge never goes away, it only decreases. I was miserable for a good several months in the first year. Now its just a oh that'd be nice right now thought and then saying nah. But you can't do it alone. I lived on a college campus being a student at the time, and every corner had students taking bogey break constantly. No addict can fight the urge unless you have inhuman will power. You need friends and or family to keep you accountable. Good luck. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Wean yourself down to the essential cigs as much as possible. For me that was three a day, wake up, a stress cig sometime midday or after work if it was a good day and a before bed one. [SEP]', '[CLS] I heard someone, maybe on a podcast can t remember, talking about how although everyone knows that smoking is bad for you in the abstract it s difficult to really comprehend or convince ourselves of the damage we are doing to ourselves in the moment. It helped me to visualize how many cigs I smoked a day and how that translated into the packs I had smoked over my life. I tried to envision the pile that made and that every or any single one of of those could be the one to give me cancer and kill me. I really tried to take that in and to consider my habit as actively trying to harm myself. [SEP]', '[CLS] Then I took it day by day. My then boyfriend hated me smoking so on his birthday I didn t smoke. It was tough but I made it. Then I thought you know I did it yesterday, let me just see if I can do it today and on and on. Till I made it a week. I even thought maybe I d reward myself if I made it to a week with one but then I made it to a week and thought fuck that let me see I can do another week. And another. [SEP]', '[CLS] I haven t touched one since. Stressful situations make it hard try five minutes of meditation or a brisk walk or really anything else first before giving in. Just try to make it a little longer and longer. Try not giving in. Also if you are like me and a social smoker you might have to lay off the booze for a while. The hootch makes it so much harder to keep your resolve. [SEP]', '[CLS] Good luck You can do it. [SEP]', '[CLS] I smoked cigarettes for years, am coming up on months being smoke free. I was smoking a cigarette with my friend one morning, took a few drags realized that I just didn t want to do it anymore. Started to realize how it was affecting me, as I would wake up with chest pains my mouth feeling dry disgusting. Decided to quit cold turkey, only reason I was able to do so was because I knew that I wanted to quit. That aspect of addiction is probably the toughest thing to overcome. It s much harder if you still desire to smoke, luckily enough for me I no longer felt that way. Went through nearly weeks of withdrawal dealt with nausea vomiting, massive headaches body aches, fatigue, loss of appetite. It certainly sucked, but not once did I even crave a cigarette during that time. I feel so much better having quit, cigarettes don t even cross my mind anymore. Mental physical health have definitely improved over the last half year as a result. [SEP]', '[CLS] You can start with something like the JUUL, but there are cheaper ways refillable pods, non pod systems, etc. to wean yourself off. [SEP]', '[CLS] You can satisfy your nicotine craving and eventually dial it down to , without inhaling all the other crap that is in cigarettes. [SEP]', '[CLS] Eat healthy snacks. Drinks lots of water. [SEP]', '[CLS] I managed to quit only after I figured out I only started to piss off my parents. I was a long time smoker, but when I had this realization I quit without cravings. I actually have no idea how long it s been since.

Bring things to chew on in the car, develop a new habit to do in place of what you did previously. So if you used to wake up, get a cup of cofffee, then go outside for a cigarette first change that to getting ready while you drink coffee or make a phone call.

[SEP]', '[CLS] First off I chose a date to quit, it was around a month ahead of time, this was because of some upcoming parties and wanted to enjoy myself. [SEP]', '[CLS] By then I had the mindset that I just would never smoke again. This was before vaping, so every time I wanted a smoke I had a mint instead. When it got really bad I brought some herbal cigarettes from a health shop. They were disgusting but it helped. [SEP]', \"[CLS] When it got really, really, really bad I used nicorette gum, this stuff works by releasing nicotine every time you chew. Don't keep chewing otherwise it'll taste bad.

During this phase, just do stuff constantly. Clean your garage, weed the yard, go on a hikewhatever  Distract yourself. [SEP]', '[CLS] The next few weeks. The constant cravings subside, but you will have cravings at odd times during the day with your morning coffee, after a meal, when you walk past somebody smoking and it smells so good. Distract yourself with other thoughts, or do a brief mediation.

Don't bum a cigarette at a party, don't buy a pack just to have a few. Just don't. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The patch. It helped so much. I still wanted a cigarette, but i wasnt going to kill anyone if i didnt smoke. Also, my boyfriend really wanted me to stop. Xoxo.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Then, I totally upped my hygiene game and reminded myself that the minute I smoked, it would all be undone. Brushed my teeth several times a day. Switched from coffee to tea.

Before long, I rarely even thought about cigs. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The best tip I can provide is before you even begin pick a date that you're gonna stop smoking. When I quit there was month left until the end of the football season, I knew I loved to have some beers and watch football which would lead me to smoke. [SEP]\", '[CLS] So I picked the last day after the Superbowl to stop smoking. I was able to, during that month try to be conscious and reduce my smoking where I could. By the time the day came I had timed my last pack, I smoked the last one knowing it would be the last. That was years ago. [SEP]', '[CLS] Be broke, so you cant afford to smoke.

It's essentially a replacement and you end up smoking the juul a lot more because you can smoke it wherever. Doesn't leave a smell or anything. So now i'm trying to quit smoking these things. I just ordered the lower nicotine pods off the site so i'm going to try that way. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Switching to juul honestly helped me a lot. I feel better, don't smell like cigs and i'm saving money as well. Try it out. [SEP]\", '[CLS] First of all, you have to go cold turkey. You can t taper off or do nicotine substitutes. You ll just be half assing it that way and it makes it that much harder to be nicotine free for good. [SEP]', '[CLS] It s gonna be scary at first, because you are redefining your life without cigarettes. The first two weeks are rough, I won t lie. You re gonna feel like an incorrigible child, not getting their candy. You re going to be very aware of all of your triggers to smoke. Once you get past those two weeks, half the battle is won because you got through the physical cravings. The mental addiction lasts much longer. I m four years quit and I still sometimes get a mental craving, but it always passes and I m off to other things. [SEP]', '[CLS] Be aware that your mind is going to play tricks on you. Your body and mind are rebelling against you because it is being denied something it s regularly gotten for a long time. You re brain is going to tell you, C mon. Just one smoke isn t going to matter. No one has to know. It will be our secret. Do not listen. Those first weeks and months are slippery, so it s really important to stick to your guns during this time. [SEP]', '[CLS] Chewing gum is good for the cravings, but I think cinnamon gum is more effective. It has some bite to it that helps take your mind off the need to smoke. [SEP]', '[CLS] Have a support system. Tell your people that your doing it. Having people championing you helps keep up your will power. Let them know the small victories you have each day fighting through the cravings. The encouragement will really give you a kick in the pants to persevere.

The farther removed you are from cigarettes the prouder you ll be. [SEP]', '[CLS] And smokes aren t cheap anymore, so think about how much cash you re going to be saving. That s ultimately what got me through. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This is a bit of a CBT technique, but re frame in your mind what you're doing by quitting. When you quit, what makes it really tough is the massive anxiety you get when you don't get nicotine that you body is craving.

And, every anxiety spike I can endure is exercise to resist anxiety from here on out . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] At least, this is what worked for me. It really helped me resist those urges to go fuck it, just one won't hurt this quitting process . [SEP]\", '[CLS] Find a way to break the habits of those times you want to smoke. Like while driving, or relying on it for a break at work. I actually achieved that portion with using Quikmist spray for a while. It broke my habit of needing a cigarette once x happens. It then helped when I actually cut the nicotine out fully, since you have less reminders. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I smoked for almost years. I tried times before I actually made up my mind to quit for good. Biggest help was those disposable eCigs I think the brand was Blue. Not sure if they're still around but plenty of vape options.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Smoke cigarettes normally, except minutes before you smoke, use the vape then smoke. [SEP]', '[CLS] The last part is really important since you will always have nicotine on your body when you smoke a cigarette. This will trick your brain into disassociating nicotine with cigarettes. After a couple of days when your brain wants nicotine it will not ask you for a cigarette, you will instead crave the e cig.

Smoke the one and fill it with the one. Keep doing this and it will gradually go from to nicotine without you noticing. When the bottles run out buy another one and keep smokingbjt four a couple of days. [SEP]', \"[CLS] th step Stop smoking whenever you want because you're not dependent on nicotine anymore. [SEP]\", '[CLS] th step Never ever in your life pick up a cigarette because it will slowly creep on you and make you addicted again. [SEP]', '[CLS] th step if you do get addicted again rinse and repeat. [SEP]', '[CLS] Mini stroke yrs ago did it for me. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I've quit many times in the last years. I've tried Zyban, Chantix, patches, gum and going cold turkey. . weeks ago I decided to quit again using patches. I found an app called Smoke Free. Whenever I'd crave a cigarette I would open the app to see the progress I've made. It tells you how long its been since you last smoked, the money you've saved and health benefits. Highly recommend this app to anyone trying to quit. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Edit I stopped the patch after weeks. [SEP]', '[CLS] My wife gave me a blowjob every day I went without smoking. So get yourself one of those . [SEP]', '[CLS] Not a smoker, but a dipper. Best tip for me was I started identifying as not a dipper , so whenever anyone would ask if I wanted a pinch or cig I d just say sorry I m not a dipper smoker . [SEP]', \"[CLS] I was doing work in a hospital and realized that there weren't a lot of old people who were obese or old people outside smoking. Just threw the pack I had away and stopped cold turkey. Quitting after the pack is done will never happen. You just have to want to quit and then quit. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This might not seem like something to think about, but I have known at least other people who wanted to quit and are still smoking. I wanted to quit and after my dad passed away my mom told me, you know your dad wanted you to quit. That was the final nail to make me go through with something that I needed to do for a while. [SEP]', \"[CLS] years later still no cigarettes and I am going to run tomorrow a half marathon with a goal of sub hour time. I still believe I made the best decision to quit smoking and the desire to quit is something I tell anyone who asks how I quit. Without that, it's gonna be a whole lot harder to do. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Collect your last few packs of butts in a jar. Fill it half full of water after you have finally quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] When you get a craving, open the jar and have a great big smell of that ashy, tarry bullshit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Get away from people that do it or any place that has smokers.

[SEP]\", '[CLS] For me, I just had to get to the point where I was sick of spending money on something that makes me feel like hacking up a lung first thing in the morning. I was able to finally quit cold turkey after a few failed attempts. My roommates at the time friends of mine were really positive influences as well. [SEP]', \"[CLS] There's no trick to it.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Hey OP, something that helped me a lot https wwwstevepavlina com blog days to success. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Basically it's a challenge with yourself to smoke the least possible for days. I smoked for years and failed to stop numerous times before trying this method. Something that made me failed is that I had no tolerance to failure at all if I smoked one cig I started all over again. With this method I kickstarted the habit of not smoking and I've been mostly smoke free for years now. I can smoke from time to time now and not relapse but I almost never feel like it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Don t quit today or tomorrow. Book a date in the future, maybe one that has some meaning a family members birthday . In the meantime, don t cut back, just carry on as normal knowing that the day you quit is finally ahead of you. You will start to realise how much you are looking forward to it and whether you really want to quit. If you don t really want it, there s not a lot of point trying.

Now I find it disgusting, I haven't smoked in over a year and whenever I imagine smoking I feel sick remembering that awful taste in my mouth. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I used to smoke a pack a day, back when it was still okay to smoke in restaurants. Never vaped. I tried seriously to quit over times before I finally made my mind up. I did my research, which said your odds of quitting increase to over if you do these three things get social support set up, use the patch, and use a prescription medication like Zyban Wellbutrin or Chantix. [SEP]', '[CLS] I talked to a pharmacist, who told me there are behavioral and a mental sides to addiction. The pills reduced the mental struggle by reducing cravings and anxiety, and the patch removed the physical withdrawal. The withdrawal creates cravings. He said that the cigarettes, or vaping, give you doses of nicotine, so there is a rush and a withdrawal with every cigarette. The key is to avoid those little withdrawals, by keeping a steady stream of nicotine entering your bloodstream via the patch. This gives your brain a chance to break the behavioral habit side of it before you break the physical dependence side of it. He said to get the strongest patch and step down. I wore the strongest for a month or two, then stepped down to the medium for a couple months, then the weakest patch for the last two months. [SEP]', '[CLS] Two weeks in advance, I got on the prescription, and I started telling everyone I was going to quit on December . Be as public as you can. Ask everyone for their support. They ll be thrilled to help you. [SEP]', '[CLS] On quit day, I started by not smoking first thing in the morning and wearing a nicotine patch. I brushed my teeth, chewed gum, and ate baby carrots in the car. I gave up sodas and coffee, too. Carried a water bottle everywhere and drank lots of water. I cleaned the house thoroughly and washed all of the smoke smell out of my clothes. Cleaned the car, too. Threw out all the ashtrays. Stopped taking break outside with smokers. I stopped sitting around, watching television, and instead rode my bike. I hung out with non smoking friends. [SEP]', '[CLS] Reward yourself Each week, I would take the money I would have spent on cigarettes, and used it to buy myself a treat. Each month I was smoke free, I rewarded myself again. I experienced occasional cravings, but fewer and fewer as time went by. [SEP]', '[CLS] I stayed on Zyban for a year. I stayed on the patches for six months. [SEP]', '[CLS] If you really want to quit, stack the deck in your favor. Plan for winning. Make winning as easy as possible and make smoking the hardest, least convenient thing. Make it your first priority. Put as many obstacles between you and a cigarette as you can. [SEP]', '[CLS] My parents smoked for years and about years ago switched to just vaping and barely do that now. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Wellbutrin did it for me. It's after a year or so that you have to be careful. That's when you go O I can have and then you snowball right back to a pack a day in a week. Happened to me after a Vegas trip D. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I did a p x routine with a friend and couldn't breathe at all  I threw the pack in my bag and literally cold turkey quit. Every time I wanted to smoke I took as deep a breathe as I could and tried to appreciate just the aspect of being able to breathe more so than a nasty ass hit of a cig. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Cravings don't last long and they don't go on forever but it's so hard because they're really intense. You just have to tell yourself that when they come. This will be over soon, just ride it out . I found it really helped. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Reading Allan Carr's book twice before intending to quit so I didn't actually follow the advice therein and quit at the end far too daunting and then a year or two down the line when the sub conscious mind had convinced the conscious mind that quitting now was the only option using Champix nicotine receptor inhibitor as it's known in the UK. Thankfully I had no side affects from that and it worked a charm. I don't think I'd have managed cold turkey so I'm forever grateful to the smart boffins who developed the drug. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Have a reason to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Remind yourself of that every time you want to cave. [SEP]', '[CLS] If you do cave, get over it, it ll happen at some point. Don t just think oh thats it I ve failed now, get your head in the game and think about what lead you to caving and make sure you don t do it for that reason again. [SEP]', '[CLS] Been years since I quit, I ve had cigarettes in that time for various reasons but hey every day is a day better without them. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I used lollipops. Not great for your teeth long term but I would use one whenever there was a point in my ritual times to smoke. In the car on the way to work etc. After a month or so I didn't need it.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Habits were the toughest thing to break my body was programmed to come home, eat dinner, and then light up a bowl to watch tv. so try and build a new habit whether its working out, video games, etc force yourself to do it for a few weeks . [SEP]', \"[CLS] No matter what you do, keep your mind solely focused on how absolutely awful you feel during withdrawals, and realize that is your body detoxifying. Don't give in I swear once you get past it, youll realize you never want to go through it again mine took about weeks of headaches, awful sleep, etc. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Lastly try and build a support unit, all my friends knew I was quitting, my wife knew everyone would try and keep me away from it finally during my weaker points. [SEP]', '[CLS] Good luck, I am now happily at months, and have never felt better. [SEP]', '[CLS] I did the math on how much it cost to smoke and even though I only smoked packs a week, the extra money helped when I wasnt making ends meet. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My wife quit cold turkey. She just woke up one day and said I don't swing too do that anymore. and that was that. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I read the easy way to quit smoking by Allen carr. I didn't quit until about a year after finishing the book. No withdraw or cravings. The book really helps you understand the addiction and why you smoke instead of trying to just address the symptoms of trying to quit. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I was a pack a day smoker for about years. The first thing the book tells you is that you should keep smoking while reading it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Highly recommend to anyone who is a smoker and doesn't want to die a smoker. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Like everyone else has said, you have to want to quit first. My first few attempts at quitting always failed and I would be right back to smoking a pack a day in no time. I'm honestly not sure what clicked but here are my tips. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Do it because you really want to. It's going to be hell so you need to be sure it's what you really want to do. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Mints, gum, whatever floats your boat but mints helped me immensely. [SEP]', '[CLS] My smoking was tied to habits such as eating, driving, and work breaks. I attempted to find other things to occupy my mind during these times, and also inhaled Altoids like there was no tomorrow. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Understand that no matter how bad the cravings get, they will go away. years after quitting, I don't even think about cigarettes anymore. I often forget that I ever smoked in the first place, it's a great feeling. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Keep track of your progress using an app. I thought it was neat that the app I was using would track my progress and tell me all the benefits of being quit for X amount of days. It's been years so I don't know if the app is still good but I used QuitNow on Android. It also keeps track of your stats of how many cigarettes you've not smoked and how much money you've saved. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Smoking hurts people around you. I have a friend who is just not ready to quit smoking and it breaks my heart. I love the guy to death but he's already overweight, eats poorly, and smokes like a chimney. I've tried everything I can to get him to quit but he just isn't ready see first bullet point . My fear is that if he doesn't curb the habit now while he's still got time to fix his health, it's going to be too late. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Take some deep breaths. I was extremely irritable in the weeks that followed quitting. The smallest things would set me off. Since cigarettes are what I always turned to when feeling stressed or irritated, I had to learn of new ways to cope. Deep breathing techniques helped to curb a lot of the irritation and stress plaguing me during that time. [SEP]', '[CLS] For me, I weaned myself. I was smoking one an hour so the next day, I wouldn t let myself smoke for an hour and minutes. Next day, an hour and minutes between cigs. Maybe also no smoking in the car. Little things that stretch the time out between cigs without completely depriving me. No exceptions. I did that for about a month and then got the patch. Gum, lollipops, jolly ranchers were helpful with the oral fixation part of it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Also, don t think you can be a social smoker. You can t. Taking a drag off of a friend s cig once you ve stopped is basically your first cig back on the path to being a smoker. [SEP]', '[CLS] I quit years ago and it remains one of the hardest things I ve done. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I switched to vaping to wean myself off of cigarettes, then after a year or so of vaping I quit that, too. To help, I bought a flavor that I HATED and it became smoke the shitty flavor or don't smoke at all. I picked the latter. The hardest thing was being around other people while they were smoking, just the smell was enough to make me crave it ravenously. Someone would offer me a cigarette and I would tell myself it's just one and next thing I knew I was back to my old habits. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It's been about a year since I quit smoking entirely and I have no problem being around other smokers at this point but I still avoid the temptation. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My advice would be to get rid of anything that would tempt you or remind you of the pleasure associated with smoking. I got rid of lighters, ashtrays, and accessories. I stopped going to the smoking area on breaks even though that's where my friend hangout and made it a rule that smoking in the car was forbidden that was easy after I got my new car because I didn't want it to smell bad and it didn't have an ashtray or built in lighter. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I also stopped drinking which helped a ton, too. Having a cigarette with a beer is one of my favorite things so I gave up alcohol and stopped going to bars all together in order to avoid testing my self control. or lack thereof. [SEP]', '[CLS] Went electric. Some may consider that cheating but it made it super easy. [SEP]', '[CLS] You don t need a therapist, you can just google any CBT worksheet available. [SEP]', '[CLS] I actually just quit three weeks ago. What I did was get an Addiction Clock which pretty much counts the time you ve been sober . I used it as a motivational tool. So if I was craving hard I d look at it to see how long I d made it which would help me not cave. Also chewing gum is good. And most craving only last about thirty seconds so if you start craving just do something quick to take your mind off it. Also don t drink to much in the first week or two cause you will mad crave that shit. And after the first week you will find that your cravings have gone down significantly. [SEP]', '[CLS] Cold turkey as others said. every cigarette you smoke makes you more addicted. [SEP]', \"[CLS] One of the most important things was a change in how I categorized myself. I became and called myself a non smoker. It's not that I'm quitting or I quit, it's that I don't smoke. I identify as someone who doesn't enjoy smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Been years haven't looked back. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Just stop I did it I smoked for years and just stopped. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Be a parent to yourself. You told yourself to quit, now stop making excuses and do it. You are an adult, you made the decision to smoke as an adult, now act like one if you want to quit. Cravings are rough, but you didn't decide to eat ice cream for every meal, every day for the last how ever many years. Why not You could have, and it would have been cheaper. You didn't because you didn't give into cravings. If you can stand up to those cravings, you certainly can stand up to these ones. With in two to three weeks, all physical cravings are gone, and it's just between you and your mind. If you can't control your mind to look after your own interests and goals, why bother trying to quit in the first place. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Ten years, smoke free for over three. [SEP]', '[CLS] on mobile so forgive typos i quit at the same time that i got out of a toxic friendship. basically their drama would lead to me needing to go on suicide watch at in the morning and other such stress, and that stress made it impossible for me to quit. cigarettes were calming and were somethimg i could seemingly control. when i finally stopped being their friend, i found myself with the perfect opportunity a d quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] that was in january and even tho some days i straight bloodhound the air for the sweet scent of nicotine, ive found that quitting was easier bc i wasnt just quitting one bad habit, i was quitting with a whole bad lifestyle. [SEP]', '[CLS] so maybe thats the trick quit the stuff that makes you need a smoke, then you just gotta fight your want for one. [SEP]', '[CLS] oh it does help sometimes when i shout GOD I NEED A CIGARETTE and then immediately say NO I JUST WANT ONE I DONT NEED ONE. sometimes. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Brush your teeth right after eating if you can, or at least chew mint gum for me, the after meal cigarettes were hardest to give up. You'll want to smoke less if your mouth tastes feels clean I chewed Trident spearmint and it helped. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Vaping, and now I have a juul which probably isn t the best idea but I haven t smoked in awhile. [SEP]', '[CLS] keep quitting, no matter how many times you slip. Just keep quitting, eventually the slips get further and further apart until you are able to just quit for good. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Nicotene gum helped me. I started out chewing more than the recommended dose. I was addicted to it, but I didn't care. Eventually, I transitioned to regular gum, and eventually quit chewing that. If you're trying to quit, don't stop trying. Everything is better after you quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] if possible, do pushups or some kind of exercise daily. Working out is awful when you've been smoking so I built a negative relationship with smoking and started getting fit at the same time. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Cutting down or taking a break from drinking can be good too as that becomes a self feeding cycle, plus your discipline is lowered when you drink. [SEP]', \"[CLS] When I was out and about I would keep a cigarette behind my ear and see how long I could keep it there before I would smoke. It helped satisfy one aspect of the addiction which was physically having a cigarette and helped to delay the actual smoking. I eventually worked that into just needing to put a cigarette behind my ear and that was it. Eventually a hobo or someone would ask me for a cigarette and I'd just pass it along. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I tried cold turkey about years ago I lasted about weeks I ve been using a Smok Infinix over the past month to cut out cigarettes, and I ve also lowered my Nicotine amount. Not only has it saved me a ton of money since the pods are refillable, I haven t craved a cigarette since. [SEP]', '[CLS] Just stop and be happy u no longer smoke. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Don't smoke at work. It's easy to get in the rhythm after that and stop thinking about it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Well I've managed to quit smoking after years and what really helped me was constantly vaping. Not the greatest alternative, but after about a month of mg nicotine juice I switched to and haven't smoked since. For me, part of it is that the vape juice is so sweet good tasting and then when you hit a cig it tastes like ass. Unfortunately I had to vape all the damn time to beat the urge. Now I can go all day without it at all cause I'm not physically addicted. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I will say the hardest part for me was the shitty justification I'd make in my head. oh, I've had a bad day I can just go grab a pack then give the rest to x friend that smokes. Never worked. Then I started bumming instead of buying and giving friends cash to make up for it. Same damn thing. Good luck. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Work up to your quit date by stop smoking in your trigger environments first driving, coffee, booze, work. If you can break those habits for a month, you can quit smoking cold turkey all together. [SEP]', '[CLS] Nicotine is physically addictive but smoke is very mental. [SEP]', \"[CLS] You need to know that making the decision to quit isn't something you do just once. You have to make that decision over and over again every time you crave for a smoke. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Also, get some kind of nicotine product, it really helps with the cravings. [SEP]', \"[CLS] There are apps that helped me. Knowing that you've saved a shit ton of money was nice. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Perseverance. Try to do things that keep you busy. Exercise. Don t drink loads of alcohol or cut down on nights out and events that make you wanna do both. [SEP]', '[CLS] Read a lot, especially Allan Carr s How To Stop Smoking. That book changed my mindset, and my perspective on the drug. [SEP]', '[CLS] Also don t be afraid to fail. Remember at the end of the day you re only human, and you will fail. But then one day you won t need to think about quitting, you ll have quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Took me three times, and two relationships to really give up the ghost. It s been one year and three months without a single cigarette, and I ve never felt more alive. [SEP]', '[CLS] This is going to sound dumb, but seriously just do it cold turkey. Find a friend or family member that will stay with you the first few days try to take a few days off of work to deal with the withdrawals and wait it out. [SEP]', \"[CLS] You'll feel like absolute shit the first three days, pretty bad for a week, and feel great after a month. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I went the Nicorette route. Quitting cold turkey wasn't feasible. Nicorette took care of the cravings until I got over the chemical addiction, then just weaned off of the lozenges until I didn't need them. Worked pretty well. Going on years tobacco free and being around cigarette smoke doesn't bother me. [SEP]\", '[CLS] If you want to go the medical route, Wellbutrin stopped my smoking habit. Granted, I took it for depression but not wanting to smoke was a pleasant outcome. [SEP]', '[CLS] You have to really want to do it. I did not use any methods to help you with, unfortunately  Half way through a cigarette, I decided I was done. Gave the rest of my pack away. That was that. It has been almost years. [SEP]', '[CLS] I did the session program from hypnosisdownloads dot com and would highly recommend it to any English speaker who wants to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I didn't feel any significant urge to smoke until about a week after I finished listening to the program. But by then it was too late. I was not going to get suckered into wasting more money. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Smoked for years. Pack or more a day. Decided it was time. You have to be ready, because quitting sucks, but is sooooo worth it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I did the patch for months total. I spent the extra money on getting the name brand Nicoderm, not the generic. I started at the highest dose, and went down about every weeks til I felt ok being without completely. Haven't has so much as a puff since March . Still like the smell, but don't miss it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Quit as many times as you need to, but understand when you're serious about it you must commit to never having another puff on a cigarette ever again. This is the only thing that will work. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Similarly, you will have to embrace the cold turkey mentality but not necessarily the method. What do I mean by this You will have to come to a point where you will not assuage cravings with an NRT. You will just have to grit your teeth through withdrawals and starve your body of nicotine until it gives up asking for it. [SEP]', '[CLS] People who allow themselves to believe that NRTs are going to make quitting painless set themselves up for failure. After your last patch lozenge etc., you just have to grind it out if you continue to substitute even with substantially lower doses of nicotine you are going to end up addicted to NRTs or relapse or both. Trust me. [SEP]', \"[CLS] So use NRTs as a way to make that final battle less violent and exacting. Go through the physical purging hacking up crap, having flu like symptoms while on the NRTssure  Get yourself to a point where your body is looking for mg of nicotine daily as opposed to sure  Just know that no matter how much you wean yourself off, that last stage where you say 'no more' will be difficult and there is no resolution but to bear with. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Its been days. Vape pen helps. Its not so much the tobacco i miss as much as the other stuff. A week of solid insomnia has been pure torture. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Set rules for yourself and follow them. Mine were no smoking in the house, no smoke breaks at work. Went from a pack a day to a pack every to days. Then I bought a vape so I could sit on the couch and smoke when it was too cold to go outside. I just never bought another pack of smokes. I never really tried to quit, it just happened on it's own. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Actually decide you are a non smoker. Until I thought of myself as ex smoker instead of a smoker trying to quit it never worked. That and even a stupid cheap vape pen just to give you the oral fix. [SEP]', '[CLS] I used a vape with no nicotine for about months. After the hardest part you just have to  not do it I guess. Realize that many habits trigger your desire to smoke. Pay attention and do something to distract yourself in the moment of a craving. You just need minutes.

[SEP]\", '[CLS] So my plan was to tackle things one at a time. For me, the ritual of holding the smoke between my fingers and taking a drag were pretty strong, so I switched to snus.

I got to the point where cigarettes kinda disgusted me from the smoke smell and lost all desire to smoke just dip. [SEP]', \"[CLS] From there I switched to the patch.

As you approach the date, with every inhale, think about all the shit that s going in, condition yourself to hate it. When the date arrives, stop.

However, over the last few months, gradually, any romancing went away. Previously, if I craved a smoke, I would picture myself smoking it, coughing, reversing any good health benefits I have now. I would tell myself that I would not want to hurt my family or friends who were proud of me, or I would think about how this quit, my first quit, is my golden ticket, and to relapse would probably lead to me smoking and quitting over and over.

OH SO TRUE NONE of us, should misunderstand the false sense of security we get Once an addict, ALWAYS an addict and that's it I STILL kick myself for the st 'relapse' after being clean for a year and half or more  don't remember exactly There were no 'cravings' that I recall  plus, in those days, I smoked EVERYWHERE except bed Thank God, I'd moved during that glorious time, so at least when I did start mental note to hit myself it was only on the balcony  but still and for MONTHS I had it under control   reminds me of my little brother GRHS, and his heroine addiction anyway, it got worse and worse, till I practically LIVED on the balcony at times Have quit, like you Chrys, MANY times between then and now, but this has lasted the longest since my st, I mean but I'm NOT being lulled into that FALSE sense of security oh no My point being, smoking, heroine, crack, booze, whatever the addiction, it's STILL AN ADDICTION My name's Ria and I'm an addict Love and peace to you ALL xox xox xox. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I have been smoke free for a long time now. I stopped counting after half a year. I have to say that I still get lets call them memories of smoking . I started when I was a teenager so i smoked through the interesting period of my life. Now that I do something, like travel, l do get a feeling that yeah, i used to go outside for an arrival cigarette . Nicotine withdrawal is long gone but even in the long run you still will get flash backs from time to time. That's why motivation is so important. I quit many times, before I realized that i need some foundation. Now I always say, that relapse is not a big problem but before resuming smoke free life you have to think hard on why you relapsed. I used to relapse because i had a stressful day , I thought that smoking calms me. Only by truly understanding that smoking does not calm me that I was able to stop smoking once realization came I didn't need to quit, I just stopped. I am repeating myself because that It calms me was what I believed and a lot of smokers do believe. The moment you stop smoking withdrawal begins and by smoking again you are just temporarily eliminating withdrawal symptoms thus perpetuating this circle of misery. By the way, for me last symptom was high energy. Weather permitting I was on a bicycle every day burning that extra energy and aggressiveness D. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The contents of my last ashtray went into a jar that I half filled with water. I keep it screwed tightly shut for obvious reasons. A couple of times when I have had cravings for a smoke that tested my resolution, I unscrewed the lid and took a good long sniff of what I've been missing. That subtle and complex bouquet of fragrance that I might otherwise refer to as Satan's kimchi. This is the ROMANCE of smoking. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Yes, nicotine is out of system very quickly and withdrawal symptoms are actually are a great and wonderful things. That is your body adjusting itself to run on higher grade fuel in front of your eyes. You can feel yourself improving and if you understand what it is it stops being negative and becomes a very positive thing. Staying the course is a question of did you quit or did you stop smoking . If you feel that not smoking is a struggle you have to look at the reason why you feel this way. I am guessing you are quitting for a reason so now look at why you feel that being smoke free is something you have to work on. What is it that you think smoking was giving you positive. Smoking is a self sustaining purely negative habit. All other habits have at least one positive feature. Smoking has none. So to stay the course you need to explore what you think you would gain from smoking and clearly understanding that you will NOT get this from a cigarette.Edited January , by MarylandQuitterAdvertising.

Once you answer that and you decide you want a smoke free life badly enough, all you need then is personal commitment. You know the drill by now. You know what you're facing. It's the same thing all of us face when we quit. Educating yourself about the addiction, keeping a positive mindset throughout your quit and sheer determination through the initial days will get you there. It may not be pleasant but it will work and it will be worth it. You, like us, will see that those difficult days won't last that long. Take it in small bits at first.

I was out drinking one night with a group of people I rarely hang out with  so it gave me opportunity. I kinda rationalized it as my free New Years cheat, which I had thought about granting myself. But I didn't smoke on New Years or any other time in the last months. They do say you can do that reward if you earn it sort of thing on diets, obvs I would not recommend it here. I'll just reiterate  not worth it. It only takes for the cracks to start in your 'quit' psyche. I have noticed more urges since then. I still have absolute resolve, so its not that bad. Its been weeks, hell I had beers the next night and didn't smoke. But I had almost forgotten to think about smoking until I had those. Even around friends who smoke, it's like I'll hang. I have desire. it's not ever worth cheating, it's like a crack in glass. You seriously weaken your mindset and have to start filling in the cracks again. I kinda understood this going in, but it totally reinforced by belief.

On the third day, you are even more proud of your accomplishments, there are still strong urges to smoke at times, but it is less frequent now. On the fourth day i saw a drastic reduction in my desire to smoke and the urges were reduced substantially as well. I remember on this day i had to drive for a good hour for a long meeting with a client, and normally after such a meeting i would have been running back to my car to grab a smoke, but this time i did not feel like i needed it and this was an awesome feeling.

First, congratulations on your decision to try to quit smoking Helping you succeed is why we're all here, and so I hope you don't mind if I add my own thoughts about your plan to cut down smoking a little bit at a time. Many people on this board have different ideas about the best way to quit smoking, but I'm fairly sure that most of them will agree with what I'm about to say. Quitting by cutting down SOUNDS like a good plan, but it probably isn't. I bet almost all of us have tried to get it under control a number of times, and failed. The reason is because we're addicted to nicotine, and by cutting back a little bit at a time we're just prolonging our suffering and reinforcing how hard it is for us to stop. We might seem to succeed for a little while, but eventually we'll run out of willpower and go right back to where we where before. And then we have to start all over again, and we feel more powerless than ever. If we just QUIT, then we have to endure withdrawing from nicotine for a few days or weeks mostly the first week is the worst part and then it quickly gets easier and easier, until after a while we start to forget what it was even like to smoke.

How can a person sleep hours a day when we have career's It's not like I can take month's off work simply because I stopped smoking. I hope you will begin to enjoy life. Cigarettes are not what will bring you joy. We both know that. It is finding that 'something' that FEELS like joy, I guess like smoking did to you   All I can say to the new people who want to become a non smoker is first off, you want to WANT IT, and badly. Not just because of health reasons, family, friends etc. YOU are the one who has to want it, and then YOU are the one who will go through whatever your body will do when you stop feeding smoking the poison. It is not a fun little stroll in the park not at all. But every hour, every day you can say 'wow, I didn't smoke for x amount of time' will hopefully make you want to keep setting another short goal. Maybe another hour, a day and so on.It still sucks. For me anyway, it sucked bad. In spite of all the health risk blah blah blah, there were times I did enjoy a cigarette with my coffee. A cigarette with my friend's on wine night. Or a cigarette when I was pissed off at the world.

NRT doesn't solve the problem with Nicotine addiction. It just shifts the focus from one source to another. Using NRT may have other side effects as well. The problem is that Nicotine is the addictive drug, it just doesn't matter which source it comes from. Compared to NRT, probably the only benefit, as far as I know, is that harmful tar in the case of regular cigarettes and chemicals released as vapor from the liquid used in e cigarettes , are not being inhaled. From what I've learnt, Nicotine as a stand alone drug comes with its own health hazards. NRT may help some and may not help others. It depends from person to person. I am glad that NRT has helped you stay away from the more harmful cigarettes and e cigarettes. I do hope that one day you will be completely Nicotine free.

I know what I am doing this for. I need to keep in touch with that. I do really want to free myself, although there will be times my nicotine wired brain will tell me otherwise. Thanks again and I'l be back. Congratulations You quit smoking Start tomorrow off with a pledge of NOPE and drink your cafe in a different place just to switch things up. I think you have avoided a lot of anxiety by quitting early and can use the momentum to carry you through the coming days. You don't smoke anymore. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Welcome aboard. I want to tell you my first quit was also in my s and lasted about as long as yours. Divorce got me started again or so I told myself and I was a musician in Las Vegas lounges and everyone smoked for the most part. Casino s full of smoke back then and it was part of the lifestyle. Fast forward years plus. I am and this is the first quit that lasted any length of time. Almost years and it s going to last. I want you to think about making this quit stick for good and tell you if you do you have a good chance of avoiding health problems I have that are smoking related. Heart stints, poor circulation, and high blood pressure. I wish so strongly that I would have stayed strong back then and avoided what I have gone through that is smoking related and who knows what lurks around the corner. Make it stick this time. Your still young enough that the damage can be repaired. My best wishes to you. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Well, I survived the very first morning ofcourse . Started reading the list I wrote but I was surprised how distant it felt. I anticipated that, it has always struck me how big of a gap there can be between 'I will never do this again' and 'Ahh, give me that smoke, I'll try another day'. Drank tea instead of coffee, hugged the boyfriend and then started panicking. Like, for real. It suddenly hit me, I was not going to smoke all day, not feeling normal, not etc  etc. After half an hour of adrenaline and anxiety I managed to calm myself down.

Quitting smoking reveals many inner truths. One lie your addict is using is, you will become more depressed if you quit smoking. This is bullshit. Smoking only feeds on our depression it doesn't cause depression. Quitting smoking is life affirming and leads to many powerful inner changes, all good Lies lies lies. Lies that you are boring.

Now stop that nonsense, don't be so damn proud of yourself and get the smokes already. You know it's what you want . Personally, I find this the worst. I can't wrap my head around it. Somehow this thought can get to me, the way a good but evil  friend talks to you and you appreciate and believe their words. I know it's not true. And still, it must have something to do with my own insecurity in general. Is it as simple as believing you can  And by that, chasing away this thought I had a long talk with my boyfriend the other night, about meditation, going through fears and all, self compassion. We often had discussions about quitting and me being so afraid. He's been with me before when I took the plunge, back then he just couldn't understand why it took me so long to feel normal again and to ease the depression. My willpower is crazy though  and it just dawned on me that that's what might get in my way, strangely enough. Im so afraid to see myself as  ok, to be alone with all this fuss in my head, to welcome my emotions so to speak. That's why I never gave meditation good chance, it seems just to scary.

Besides that, if it were to be true  excuse me, but I could really use some boredom now and than Those thoughts of becoming a boring person when we quit are in large part attributable to the lies we tell ourselves as addicts. Years and years of social conditioning also play a major factor in those thoughts. From Hollywood to Madison Avenue, much time and energy have been spent selling the false premise that all the beautiful people smoke, drink, and do drugs. This is not the time or place for my conspiracy theories, so I will simply say you have to tune out the outside voices that would have you believing that a healthy lifestyle is boring and dull.

The point Well, really just to say it is temporary and passes. A couple of weeks after quitting I started sleeping better than I had done in years.

You know your the best one to make decisions about what you can and can't take but if a lack of sleep is going to push your resolve there are options  the insomnia is an early stage thing from what I have read with others, as I said it was no different for me before quitting and after, so you can just push through this or you can try camomile tea or malted honey milk or see your doctor about a sleep aid.

After a while, they just assume that you are over it and that quitting smoking wasn't that big of a deal. It doesn't work that way, normally. As ex smokers, we have centered our lives around cigarettes for a long time and the healing process with quitting does take time. It gets much better but there are many ups and downs early on as you try to adjust to living as a non smoker again.

I know there will come a day where my junkie thought will be something like this 'there's no harm in smoking one, you've been off for longer periods of time and therefor your health risk is low'. The sad thing is, I cultivated this thought myself. I used to be so very angry with myself when I didn't succeed in quitting, it ruined my self esteem completely. Gradually I came to see that self loathing is devastating, in general actually haha. So I made a deal I will only quit if I can stay friends with myself when I fail. It became easier and I often said, well, at least I've been off for a while again and been giving my body a good period of healing. I forgave myself rather easy.

Be sure to just deal with things a day at a time initially so you don't become overwhelmed. It make things easier that way Reflect often on what you have already managed to deal with successfully because once you have completed the first weeks, you have beaten the worst of it. After that, as Johnny mentioned, it's more reprogramming your brain to function normally and happily again without smokes. It does take a long time to readjust your thinking. That doesn't involve craves necessarily but more an adjustment in your thinking. That's the part no one but a quitter really understands. That's also why it's important to stick around here with other quitters after the first while. We get it We speak the same lingo as all other new quitters. It may seem like those of us who have a year or more quits under our belts are different from you but, we're not. We were all where you are now at one time.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] My life, my recovery, Your post today brought back a flood of memories from when I was at your point in time after I stopped smoking. The memories are as if no time has passed. The emotions were so strong. I also was going through days in a heavy fog and wondering how it was perceived by the people around me. I had told nobody that I stopped smoking for about weeks. I was very surprised to find that nobody had noticed any change in me during that time. While I was definitely obsessed with the emotional changes and felt that I was wandering around in a thick fog, those around me were oblivious to any change in me. I was not concerned that I would smoke, but like you, I was very concerned about how long that state of mind would persist. I can sure understand how scary the thought of forever can be. Unfortunately, I can't offer an answer to those questions. I can only offer an understanding to much of what you are now experiencing. I know that at just under weeks quit I just kept moving forward in very small time increments. Sometimes it was just one deep breath after another, or one distraction after another. You are doing great, and there is nothing unusual about what you are experiencing. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Well how nice is that, apparantly I've been ETQing all a long.   but you are right c jane , I am committed to making this work. During a day like this, I have at least moments where I am so happy about quitting, even if it's just seconds. The other day I read something that said, when you quit, whatever you feel, it's intense. The good stuff also I totally agree. And these moments hold promises for what it will be like in the future, I trust in that. I know that I'm dealing with patterns here, not some real time demon or monster. How come it is so tempting to think about it in that way The anxiety depression thing came up frequently today. 'Ah, with my history it must be extra hard. What if I don't succeed ' and 'Be prepared to feel like this for at least a year ' . While the matter of fact is since quitting I do NOT experience any more anxiety than I usualy do and I have NO sense of that hardcore depression I know all too well. In fact, my brain is more lively than usual, I feel connected to people here, I live my life, I do my things, I make no major f ck ups. I think about rewarding myself, I wonder about self care, I try to make things as easy and enjoyable as possible for myself. And there's also the occasional fog, the crying, the bitching, the binging and the unrest. Apparantly thats just part of the deal, for now. It's funny, many people here tell me it will pass and then say right away 'although it won't be of any comfort now' but  it really is of comfort When I tell myself that, it doesn't really have the same magic effect, I guess I need some practice at that.

Not being able to enjoy a good coffee or tea without a cigaret. The constant needyness. Despite at least really sh tty days, I am so glad I am still here.

Things have calmed down a bit, since somewhere between last saturday and sunday.

Repeating over and over and training myself in that really does the trick and though it's annoying sometimes, I'm sure I'll benefit from it now and later on. It fascinates me. The time distortion, change of perspective sometimes in the blink of an eye , having a sense of real power over the addiction versus 'I'm a victim and will this ever end' yes, at times my brain thinks like that. I'm ashamed about it but it is what it is and I find comfort in the fact that I muster up the courage not to identify with that thought. Because that's where I would really have a problem and definitely would end up smoking one after another again . I remember somewhere in the beginning, I thought about balance, between surrendering to the proces aka trust while still deciding where to go next. Probably still working for me.

I remember this was an issue before somewhere in my journal, but I guess certain topics need more than just one click. Early on in my quit I dealt with many addict moments coffee, driving, phonecalls etc. etc. etc. At one point I thought I had that under control. Untill I found out that whenever the going got tough, these seemingly conquered moments where challenges again. Be it less than before, but still. Apparantly they are not just moments in time, they are all linked and flaring up whenever shit hits the fan. Smoking gave me the impression of a foundation. While, in reality, it constantly, day in day out, kept me unstable. Always looking for moments to get that dopamine fix. What that tells me is that, besides the simple fact that Im a wired nicotine addict, I have a certain need for predictability. Whenever things in life are difficult, I want to be able to fall back on something. I want to build in certainties, rythm, kindness. These past days I did that by talking to myself in the mirror How I did well at night or how proud I was for heading up for another day. No matter how corny it felt, I did it. Rythm, of doing what I promised myself. And now I realise Im almost halfway month four already. Which will be of a year. Yeah Edited December , by MLMR.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] There's one thing that absolutely motivates me to KTQ and that is that I never ever can be sure I would attempt another quit. And if so, how that would work out. Some time ago  I remember being well into the first year, so extremely proud. I took great pride in quitting, really on top of the world after every crave I conquered. One year became one and a half, two and finally three. I actually inspired some friends if she can, why not us Time went by, I hardly ever missed my nicotine killer. And I actually felt  great. But then I did the unthinkable. Smoked a tobacco joint during a festival, afterwards a cigarette. Because, what the hell and tomorrow no one will remember ah, but no. The real reasons ofcourse were some left over receptors going bonkers . The music died out, people crawled into their tents. The next morning I had coffee with a cig. And though I kept a straight and tough girl face, I knew at that point it all had been for nothing. Shame and self doubt made its way back into my mind. Fast forward, six or seven years later   august ,   it had to be now or never. This time around, things were different. Lots of bumps in the road, none of that first timers pride. I had to work to feel proud, I literally had to create happines around this whole event. On a few occasions it was like my world was falling apart and I had to get it from idontknowwhere. Ofcourse it hasnt all been straight forward misery, but no way is it comparable to these previous three years of quitting. And let that be my guide then. I will never ever want to do this again, ever. I will not grieve and crave a cigarette. I will not cry over a crashed relationship again while aching for a smoke. I wont have any guaranteed life happenings be affected by the thought of cigarettes. I will never ever let that mf nicotine mess up my soul again and I am prepared to make this a life time thing.

Recommend to anyone who may have tried alone and struggled before, or who thinks that they want to try the NRT stuff but are scared of the price. months should be enough to quit and not have to spend a cent. Tonight we went to a friends for a BBQ and beers normally would have been a time that I might have smoked a lot more than normal, but didn't really crave at all.

Nicotine gangstered our brain receptors responsible for rewards ie  dopamine . One by one we claim these receptors back. It takes a while for the endorphins and dopamine to kick in. This is why rewards are SO important, and why we recommend rewards for every crave trigger and for every celebration. I propose finding something beautiful to listen to or look at or remember when you are in a crave. It will assist your brain to trigger endorphins dopamine for Good things, for Clean things, for appropriate things and wean itself away from the poison that is nicotine.

Pick up a favourite book, give someone a hug, put a talisman in your pocket. Even faking a smile encourages endorphins and soon the smile becomes very, very real.

The physical dependence ends rather quickly but the mental side of the addiction is how we beat it or why we relapse. All of the things that cause triggers after nicotine has left your body are mostly mental. They can be memories, smells, a particular song, a ritual like smoking after dinner or with morning coffee, the first snowfall and the list can go on and on. It's going to take an entire year to experience the full cycle of life without smoking. For some the triggers are few and far between while for others they're daily. What were some of things that caused you triggers early on and how often do you get them now and what are they One thing we know for sure is that the longer you stay quit, the less frequent they become until you can't even picture yourself smoking. It doesn't matter if your week quit or years. Please share your experiences, past and present regarding triggers because with that comes hope and confidence for those who are struggling on their journey of their first full year without smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] For me The rituals. First smoke in the morning, after eating those were the toughest craves initially. I changed routines up and focused on understanding the nature of triggers understanding that all habits can be changed and that the only thing causing a desire for the next cigarette was the previous cigarette. Then I found myself hankering for a cigarette when the Spring came again, analysing where the trigger came from, why, helped me overcome them. Even now months quit I get the odd trigger. Sometimes a strong one. But I'm experienced now I ignore it and surprise surprise, it goes away. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Agree with all the above,  for me a big trigger habit was talking on the phone, I reached for a cig before I answered the phone, lit one before I made a call, then chain smoked the entire time I talked  it was one of the hardest for me to get passed, I tried lollipops, Twizzlers, cinnamon toothpicks,pacing back and forth  but what worked for me was twirling my hair with my free hand  don't know why it works for me, and I really don't care why it works I still do it   it works and thats all that matters  goes to show it's important to keep trying things until you find one that works for you and your particular smoking related trigger habit . [SEP]\", '[CLS] When I first quit, after the all the time cravings ended, I had alot of triggers such as the after work cig . They faded one by one. One of the most lingering was the first cig in the morning. Now I get some thoughts when driving in the car or when thinking about,strangely, fun times, such as vacation or a night out with friends. I do not think about smoking when stressed. I get wistful, as if smoking was ansign of youth, or freedom. I do this too with other substances. So, these are thoughts, not cravings.

I would love to smoke really but probably best to avoid that bad habit Jetblack I think you and I are struggling with the same demon. I don't want smoke in my lungs, but I want to smoke. I don't want to smell like a cigarette, but I want to smoke. I don't want to spend half of my disposable income on tobacco, but I want to smoke. I don't want to die a slow, painful death, but I want to smoke. I don't want to set such a horrible example for my kids, but I want to smoke. I don't want to be out of breath when I'm walking up a flight of stairs, but I want to smoke. So, I'll keep reading about addiction and NOPEing until it finally sinks in to my thick skull. Maybe I'll always want to smoke, who knows I am an addict after all. But, as long as we want to be non smokers more than we want to be smokers, we can still win this battle.

The physical dependence ends rather quickly but the mental side of the addiction is how we beat it or why we relapse. All of the things that cause triggers after nicotine has left your body are mostly mental. They can be memories, smells, a particular song, a ritual like smoking after dinner or with morning coffee, the first snowfall and the list can go on and on. It's going to take an entire year to experience the full cycle of life without smoking. For some the triggers are few and far between while for others they're daily. What were some of things that caused you triggers early on and how often do you get them now and what are they One thing we know for sure is that the longer you stay quit, the less frequent they become until you can't even picture yourself smoking. It doesn't matter if your week quit or years. Please share your experiences, past and present regarding triggers because with that comes hope and confidence for those who are struggling on their journey of their first full year without smoking. bump.

You reclaim your brain and that receptor will no longer rely on nicotine. It's pretty cool how our brain will heal itself. This is why rewards are so important.

I can recall when all the bans came on about smoking in designated areas, where I felt utterly despised almost to a criminal status, this was one of my reasons to continue to smoke, I thought that everyone should choose what they want to do with their life, and not listen to the status quo. A bit of a rebel really. It was by accident that I came across a video during my first few months of quitting, which totally transformed my way of thinking. This was a Video by NASIA DAVOS, called How to be a happy non smoker presented by TEDxUniversityofPiraeus. Similar to the one on your website. It made me look at my belief system for many things which I had to unravel before I could understand just why I wasn't able to sustain my quit for longer periods.

A bit of a rebel really. I used to think exactly so, forestgreen. I was an aggressive smoker, smoking where and when as often as possible. I didn't hide it, I flaunted it. In the early days of vaping nicotine before any regulation, I would supplement my dry tobacco with a vape and I took extra delight in getting my fix in places like Whole Foods or organic groceries. I was an idiot, yes. I was an addict. It was only after understanding the tenants of addiction that I was able to admit my folly. I wasn't a rebel at all.

The very moment you drop your defense of the addiction and allow yourself to accept the truth, the entire myth of the cigarette unravels immediately.

I've been on blood pressure medicine since my late 's and instead of quitting smoking I chose to have tubal ligation surgery because my Dr wouldn't prescribe birth control after years old IF I WAS A SMOKER. But I never contributed my cold feet and hands to smoking until I quit. When you lose circulation to your extremities you risk the loss of limb. I wish I remembered just how far into my quit I was before I noticed it but at the time I was too concerned about my bleeding gums to even notice. Turned out this too was the new flow of blood due to quitting and within a month or so my gums had color back to them.

So why am I bringing this up three years after quitting Because I don't want to ever forget where I came from.

It is more than a few days for your body to get rid of nicotine, a lot depends on how long how much you smoked.

If it took you a while to rewire your brain about the realities of cigarettes but you didn't smoke, you are a successful quitter. Smoking is an addiction. Cigarettes are something we conditioned ourselves with for years. Quitting is a process. If the process was a bit more difficult for you than others. If it took you a little while longer to turn the corner than others. If you really, really, really wanted to smoke a cigarette. If you were grouchy, bordering on homicidal, during parts of your quit If any of these conditions applied and you stayed true to your commitment and did not smoke, congratulations.

What do you think, Tiffany My thoughts I don't understand why we have to keep discussing this. Ok, I'm not the junkie sitting on the side of the road in NOLA. The tree sitting in the road was my refusal remember, it's a choice to quit smoking. This does not qualify me as an addict. Nor does it you. But if it works for you to call yourself that, then by all means, do what works for you. I'm not going to try to convince you that you're not. Just don't smoke. But I will say this  I will NEVER address on here if I'm struggling again. Because all you're going to do is tell me I'm struggling cause I refuse to admit that I am some sort of addict in denial. It can't be something as simple as I am addicted to nicotine and still trying to process through it. No, it has to be that I HAVE TO HAVE A LABEL ON MY HEAD. And somehow, this label will take away any struggle I am going through. I call BULLSHIT. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I smoked, I made that CHOICE. My thoughts. And obviously, it's going to be an ongoing thing to change them. So I get to choose on here if I want to label myself as an addict or sit back and let y'all label me as hard headed, stubborn or an addict in denial. Do what y'all need to do.

Everyone's quit is unique, much has to do with attitude, general wellness, behavior lifestyle, nutrition  Keep some tricks in your tool box to help you, just in case, and keep your blood sugar up. Antidotes forced walks, cold air, intentional breathing, too much coffee, 'embracing the suck', attention to my blood sugar, alerting people that might be affected, not stressing out about it understanding that it will pass.

I don't WANT to smoke, but I can't stand this corrosive, constant fantasizing about cigarettes. That is why I relapsed in the past, that is I was trying to quiet that voice.

This should be added to the newbie package to get them to start doing the same and to see that someone else felt and went through exactly what they are going through.

And usually while a man listens he is thinking What do I say to help, how do I help,  Men dont usually just listen and go OK we arent programmed that way. We are fixers, not listeners. So figure out how to say it. Hey I'm not asking for help, but this smoking thing got me messed up, or I know you dont smoke but this stuff is hard, my skin is crawling can we go to help get my mind off it Give us husbands a chance to screw up. But point out your just venting, not looking for answers.Its too easy for us to say Just suck it up and dont smoke because they dont know how to fix it and are frustrated. Dont frustrate an idiot, help them help you. Thank you Bakon, for the whole blog so far, but especially the above. My H quit years ago and while he is very supportive, he gets a little testy if I talk too much about the process and pain of my quitting.

That's also what takes the longest to change   our habitual responses to any number of situations that crop up in our daily lives including emotions. Happy, sad, bored, lonely, excited they all create an automatic response and that is to light up. That's what the Year Pledge is for. It's located on the Quit Smoking Discussion Page pinned near the top of that page. It's an important reminder that it takes most of us a full year to completely recover face and beat all our smoking triggers at least once seasonal triggers included . That's why the Year Lido Deck celebration is such a big deal. Once you get to that year mark, you have truly arrived Sure you may still have thoughts about smoking but you have proven to yourself that you CAN beat your addiction at it's own deadly game. Yes this is an insidious addiction but there are also habitual responses involved because most of us have smoked for decades. Same response to triggers over dozens of years.

Smoking breaks It is amazing what the logic of a smoker is in regarding these little breaks. It starts with a smoker popping into drug withdrawal, breaking his or her train of thought or physical stride, and then saying or thinking to himself or herself, Oh, I think I need a break, I better go get a cigarette. What you will soon realize after quitting is that you will all of a sudden start projects and then follow them through to completion without taking these breaks. You will generally get them done significantly faster and more accurately for you won't have those constant breaks distracting you from the projects. Soon you will realize the truth of what smoking was doing to you time wise all those years. It was never that you were needing a break and thus going for cigarettes. It was that you were NEEDING cigarettes and then having to take breaks. The week you quit your efficiency may suffer, but you will make up for that lost time in a matter of days, and soon you will find yourself a more efficient person for the rest of your life.

I love the look of and like to handle anything that's well engineered especially small, heavy and chunky items. E cigs fit that criteria perfectly and I'm sure I'm not alone in appreciating nicely made objects. Even the boxes they come in are a cut above a run of the mill box. They've also become very tactile and the colours can be very attractive. In all honesty, they're a nice piece of kit but that's part of the problem now. Apart from delivering nicotine, they're a very attractive fashion item. Cigarette manufacturers have always tried to make their product appealing but they just had a box to work on whereas e cig design has endless possibilities. That must be stacking up to be a big problem as technology advances irrevocably. The liquids also smell good enough to drink cookies and cream, pear drops, McDonald's apple pie etc etc. you name it, they have it. Even the dedicated e cig shops look trendy, upmarket and inviting. Now that the dangers of vaping are being realised, I wonder if the e cig makers will at some point be forced to make their product drab with graphic warning images on them, as cigarette makers were latterly obliged to do with their packaging.

The biggest hurdle to me in quitting is your day to day life habitual smoking routine. Whether you smoke cigs or vape, it's the garb a smoke reaction to so many daily life events that is the hardest thing to get past and takes the longest period of time to reconstruct your life. I get the fact that some may want to soften the early quit challenges by continuing to feed nicotine via a properly controlled NRT program. It has clearly worked for some, as has prescription medication such as Zyban and whatever else that's called. I do believe that stopping the flow of nicotine ASAP is also a requirement but just not at the very start of one's quit. What concerns me more than the patch programs are these gums, sprays and lozenges. Those items seems like candy to me. Therefore, more difficult for people to control the dosage plus the temptation to combine any number of NRT's without appropriate medical consultation. Too many want to believe there's a magic bullet out there somewhere that will eliminate the hard work aspect of quitting and that's just not the case. No question, there are potential issues with NRT's but they have done a lot of quitters a service and continue to do so if used appropriately.

Relapsing and smoking a cigarette is a conscious decision. No life event made the person light up. The person decided to light up and relapse on their own.

This quit I am now seeing them in a different way. I'm pitying the way they are addicted to nicotine. Pitying the fact they spend so much money.

Massive achievement's mixed with abject failures. Achievement's being the running, which is still going well albeit after a short hiatus due to niggling little injuries. Failures being the couple of times I have actually smoked. Single days out being the main culprits, once at an all day music gig and two separate days out on the demon drink. I don't know why I bother drinking it always leads to smoking. There was one longer period of smoking which lasted a week. It started off with a day holiday and when I returned from holiday I finished the rest of the week smoking. That was the beginning of August and that was the last time I smoked. I seem to get to a point in my quit and then start looking for a reason to smoke. Before the day holiday I had made my mind up I was going to be smoking for the days. The grip had got me that much. Same with the one day music gig, I had decided before it I would be smoking that day. I feel now like I will never smoke again. I have no feeling for it and no desire. I'm currently loving running and I have taken onboard a lot of the Allen Carr books teachings of the nicotine trap. I totally get what he is saying. I feel like the final hurdle is these urges that come out of nowhere that make me plan when I'm going to smoke. As I say at this moment there is no need or desire. It always comes with alcohol but I have no alcohol days planned. The cure could be to go out and have the day out if I must but to pre plan to leave when the urge comes. Just slope off to save my own sanity. It's more important than being a social, jovial soul.Edited September by tocevoD.

Congratulations on quitting smoking, tocevoD Change your quit date from to the date you actually quit smoking. so we can plan all your celebrations Drinking and smoking can often be real problems in a quit. I have friends that only smoke when they drink and then go weeks without smoking. It still means they have a nicotine addiction and it is the addiction we must confront. For me, I kept away from alcohol for a few weeks and then just went for it. I drank and didn't have any craves that I couldn't wouldn't defeat. It is a state of mind. Either you smoke or you don't smoke. Drinking will not lead you to smoking if you don't smoke, it will only lead to smoking if you want it to. If you are sabotaging your quit, you will undoubtedly succeed. I would ask you to consider why you relapsed. Alcohol only lightens our inhibitions but, there may be a chink in your armor that lets addiction through. Your commitment needs to be rock solid w no misgivings or doubts and you need to be alert, awake and aware. Putting Nicotine Addiction to sleep is serious business, a formidable opponent and not to be taken lightly at any time. Hope Alan Carr can help you understand, he has helped so many.

Prior to quitting, the environment seemed full of quit advice such as literature at pharmacies, doctors surgeries etc. Now that I've quit, the NM seems to have sneaked around and removed a lot of it. Honestly, the day after I quit, my chemist's little health advice table was lacking in the usual stop smoking advice leaflets. Similarly with my doctor's surgery. I experienced a bit of altered perception during the early days of my quit as well. It seemed like when I was smoking everyone was wagging their finger at me and telling me all the reasons I needed to quit. Then I quit and it seemed like images promoting smoking and cigarettes became far more prevalent. It was a matter of heightened perception combined with a bit of imagined martyrdom The whole planet is working against me man With time things began to even out a bit. I do still notice big tobacco's product placement in media. However, I also see the anti tobacco campaigns now.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] I didn't understand this concept of a craving in the early days of my quit almost the entire st month because if I was awake, I was almost overwhelmed with the desire to smoke. It had no beginning and no end. I just didn't think about it as often when I kept myself busy. occupied and distracted. It wasn't until later that I would occasionally get a sudden urge to have a smoke. I mostly couldn't tie those to triggers either. It would just come out of nowhere when I was almost anything sometimes nothing at all. I was never really tempted to smoke due to stress or life situations. I suppose I was able to keep my life and my quit separate like that. What was in my brain in terms of what I thought a cigarette would do for me Not really sure.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] The physical dependency of addiction played a role in my cravings. There was also the impulse of instant gratification. However, a big part of my early cravings was little more than a desire for a return to normalcy. Normalcy at the time meant just going back to smoking when I was used to smoking. I was out of my comfort zone for a while and frankly didn't know what to do with myself at times without a cigarette. I was having to act very deliberately not to light one up. It was tempting at times to just go on autopilot and smoke like I had for the previous quarter century. Funny really In March , smoking felt so normal I couldn't imagine life without it.

But mostly change, I'd now suddenly have to cope in situations where I'd smoked before, I thought I'd lost some level of comfort. I remember feeling like it was a proper new day every day in the beginning, as I was basically fighting against the comforts that I knew at the time. Oh how distant all of that now seems.

After my first failed quit, I think I had an idea of what to expect early on. I was usually able to make it through the first few days when it is said that nicotine leaves the body but I had trouble remaining focused and vigilant long term. After a few weeks and starting to feel a bit better, I fell into the old trap of thinking that one cigarette wouldn't hurt which is a horrible trap to fall into . I guess what I'm saying is that it was easy for me to quit but it was hard to stay quit.

I had the ability to focus on other things and temporarily not think about smoking. However, if I wasn't tuned in completely to something else, the smoking thoughts were always at or near the surface. The only long term issues I dealt with, which I would classify more as annoying rather than hard, were the desire to smoke after finishing a job or task and the inability to fully identify as a non smoker. I was several months into my quit before the thoughts of wanting a cigarette upon completion of a job began to cease. The identity issue was, I suppose, a combination of a lingering addiction and a bit of self doubt. Even as I put more milestones behind me, it often felt like I was just taking a break from smoking before I inevitably started smoking again. In hindsight, the hard parts weren't really all that hard. And considering what I've gotten in return for my efforts, quitting smoking is one of the best bargains of my life.

I despise the smell of cigarette smoke. But WHY do I still smoke in my dreams At least once a week I have a dream and I'm smoking in it. Dreams are fascinating and confusing. A lot of subconscious clutter comes to the surface when we dream. Many studies have been performed and many smart people have spent time thinking about the subject. And still, there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason as to why we dream the dreams we dream. Smoking is an addiction that encompassed every facet of our life. We smoked cigarettes all day. We smoked through the entire gamut of emotional states. The cigarette was always there and in turn became a part of our identity. Then we quit. The process of quitting forced us to undo years of conditioning. Quitting smoking brings about a seismic shift in our brains. I suppose that the dreams could be little more than lingering remnants of the years we spent conditioning our brains to believe in the cigarette and identify as a smoker. Vivid dreams can produce powerful feelings. The realization that it was just a dream should provide comfort. I wouldn't sweat it if I were you.

Regarding smoking dreams, I think smoking was such a big part of our lives for so long that it can still regularly be a part of our subconscious world long after we've quit.

I have to stay alert for drastic mood changes on one side, cause I know very well where they can get me.

And life just happens to give me ups and downs and they might have been far worse if I would have been smoking. I am also starting to realise the importance of the 'it's always there for me' factor. Obviously I've learn to grow comfort in the idea of cigarettes being 'here for me'. Though it's only two weeks, I am already a bit embarrased to look at it that way. So many things are here for me  not many of them 'always' and that's ofcourse where the temptation comes in, the temptation to look at cigarettes as if they were comfy, warm, friendly, non judgemental and above all, ever available. etc. My friends, partner and family are here for me, but not always. So I will have to learn to ask for support in different ways. And even then, if they somehow are uncapable of being there at that moment, I'll have to learn that me reaching out means taking care of myself. My house is here for me, but it doesn't have arms and legs to clean itself, so I'll have to be more concious these days about making it a place where I feel at home and where I feel loved. Literally, the floor is here for me, the earth is there to carry me. Etc. How I used to hate to be 'thankful on purpose', as a way of therapeutic brainwashing, ha.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] Quitting smoking it's what every smoker desires. We've already established that the act of quitting is dead simple. You simply refrain from putting cigarettes in your mouth and lighting them on fire. And repeat. The benefits of quitting are many freedom, improved health, more money in your pocket, etc. The benefits do not end there. In fact, the benefits only begin there. The process, while simple, is a bold action a step in the right direction. You commit to leave the rut of comfort behind to begin a journey of self improvement. The process can strip you bare emotionally. It sounds harsh, but has a real upside. The process will force you to deal with things that have been swept under the rug. You will have to remove your head from the sand and face the truth. The process will force you to confront the bullstuff that you have tried to pass off as gospel truth. The truth will set you free, but it will make you uncomfortable for a while. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Addiction is a link in a chain, a chain of self destructive behavior and self defeating thoughts. You break that link and the chain that holds you back weakens. Hold on, that's when life starts to get interesting. Potential becomes reality. Confidence begets confidence. Strength begets strength. The process, one that begins with a singular purpose and commitment, sets off a series of ripples that will eventually impact every facet of your life. If you sit back and meekly accept that you are a hopeless addict, what else will you simply accept in life If you decide you deserve better and boldly commit to the process, what other bold actions to improve your lot in life will you take on Trust the process. Embrace the challenge. Enjoy the ride.

In a more mercenary vein, wealth motivated me and if I am honest, it was very important.

In ten months, I had Three Thousand I felt like Midas with all that dosh. As far as health, I was in ignorant denial and never paid much mind to health risks. Sure, a minor cold inevitably morphed into bronchitis and I certainly coughed a helluva lot but, for forty something years, I idiotically accepted that was just the way things were. I was weeks into my quit before I faced the truth and began to understand the ramifications of smoking and my nicotine addiction. Facing the damage done, I am tentatively grateful that maybe I quit in time. I feel great. Breathing is rapturous, innit Now, health is a motivator keeping me nicotine free and I haven't been knocked down with bronchitis in four friggin' years. Amazing.

I had been seriously thinking about quitting for a few months and trying to cut down November through December. I am a disabled veteran and have been treated by the VA medical system for over thirty years and the care has been anywhere from poor to good. In the last couple of years the VA has been under fire for its treatment of veterans. The doctors there would always state that I needed to quit but there was no conviction in what they were saying. A couple of years ago I was assigned new doctor and she has been pretty good and would also state on all appointments I needed a quit. I saw her in early December and went over this pretty good. A couple of weeks later some of my tests had come in and her nurse called me. The nurse said the doctor would do anything to help me quit, the tests were beginning to show some serious negatives. We had a long discussion over the phone. After that call I realized that my Doctor and the Nurse truly cared about me and not going through the motions. I do not know why but this stuck with me, so much so that after the first of this year I quit, just jumped off the cliff cold turkey. Though the last few weeks there have been difficulties I have not looked back. To say the least my VA medical team is ecstatic as well as my grandchildren .

If I ever gave in now I wouldn't be able to live with myself. The fact that I successfully quit makes me feel good about myself. And joyful.

Gives me a clue as to why I unconciously perceived it as a wonderdrug. Watch, to understand how the different nicotine receptors are hijacked by smoking.

You are not quitting smoking for her or any of these other people who are undermining you. You are quitting for you. I can tell you that, when I quit, I was taking care of two very unloving parents, who could do a real job on my self esteem. Due to their age and health, I was going out of my way to accommodate them. I allowed them to use me and emotionally abuse me. During my quit journey, I finally realized the strong person I was. I take care of me first and I do not let them control me anymore. What your are doing right now is outstanding. You are quitting an addiction, which is not an easy feat. Be proud of yourself and do not let anyone undermine that. Everyday you avoid those cigarettes you are gaining so much power and control over you life.

You my friend, are a bloody good egg. You have immense value. You deserve respect because you certainly show it. Now, when we give up smoking some of us don't have to just deal with cravings. Some of us get to face all those insecurities and hurts we have had programmed into us since we were kids. Why, because while we smoked we programmed part of our brain to think that smoking made it all feel better our brains learnt that when we felt worthless and useless usually by the people who shouldn't make us feel that way we'd have a smoke, when your mum would make you feel like shit you'd go have a smoke so of course those are the buttons our addiction will push in its dying efforts to get you to throw away your quit. You should be proud of yourself for staying true, this is a hard stage, I've been there and it passes. So, on to the family dynamic, especially your mum, here is a thought that helps me cope at times, how sad and miserable must their lives be that they need to get their own happiness by causing someone else's sadness. That is truely sad. People who need to make others feel worthless to make themselves feel superior deserve our pity. You are very much wanted, you are very much worthwhile, and warts and all even though you keep saying you have them I amyet to see evidence of we know you are more than just a person with some good.

I rolled my eyes which triggered a whole rant to the kid about how rude her mum is and she shouldn't be like that   Don't do that don't roll ya eyes, well maybe but only if noone nasty can see. . I took a big, deep breath in and out. . I counted to in English, Italian, French and Japanese in my my head . I reminded myself that there is something fundamentally wrong with the woman, that is not my fault but because I am such a strong, amazing person she uses me to try and make herself feel better. . I said nothing and went back to the conversation with everyone else there as if nothing was said this gave her fire no oxygen to burn.

Insomnia, not so much. As far as my mom goes, to be fair, sometimes she does tell me don't smoke when I'm upset , at other times she tells me I have a sick mind and demeans me. That's how she plays with my head, she doesn't realize it which is all the more annoying. I've told her I'm her son and to treat me like that, I've gone as far as being extremely blunt and saying I'm not her b h. Smoking isn't the only thing she picks on, its several things on a day to day basis and this has been going on for several years, always asking questions indirectly, speaking for me and assuming my silence as agreeing with what she said, trying to put words in my mouth, and even manipulating me into thinking I had said something when I didn't and making me look like a crazy person.

If you want to start counting the second you ash out the last one, do that. If starting the count at the beginning of your first full day without a cigarette feels better to you, do that.

The added beauty is I also love the fact I'm not clock watching once in the airport thinking can't have a smoke for the next six hours. The freedom of that is priceless.

YOUR QUIT YOUR LIFE THE PROPER SEQUENCE By Crist bal, When our quits are young, we must learn and then practice in a conscious manner, to disconnect and keep separate our quits from all life events. We learn to always keep our quits sacred, protected, and never influenced by any life event that may happen. This dynamic we may call The Proper Sequence, and it is powered by your commitment to NeverTakeAnotherPuff  NTAP . It does not matter what may happen on any day in your life as long as you maintain in a conscious manner The Proper Sequence dynamic as a primary element of your quit, you will not smoke. The Proper Sequence is YOU QUIT LIFE. NOT YOU LIFE QUIT. By maintaining this simple sequence dynamic in your quit, you will not ever have your quit influenced by life events. If you always keep your quit close to you, protecting it with your commitment to NeverTakeAnother Puff NTAP , you will never, EVER , smoke again. We build our quits, and train our minds, our emotions, and our spirits to live as non smokers in beautiful freedomby continuing to commit to NTAP. as our way of not smoking, and our way of slowly putting this awful addiction to sleep. Consciously adding The Proper Sequence dynamic to your new non smoker identity will strengthen your quit even more. Crist bal Edited July by Sazerac.

I like to stay busy and I m usually an active person. Not so much the last weeks. I have totally stop smoking as of yesterday. I was up til than only smoking cigarettes if that a day. I m hoping in a couple of days a lot of this will be totally gone. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Hi Diane, what you are experiencing is totally normal. Your body is working hard to heal from all the damage smoking has done. So if it's tired, rest. Hungry, eat. Craving sweets, eat a candy or drink some fruit juice. Just let your body dictate what it needs right now. Many of us experience shortness of breath after quitting. I have asthma and my breathing got so much worse I was questioning why I even quit But, it does get better. To ease your worry though it's never a bad idea to talk to your dr. about it. My cousin quit and doesn't have asthma but her Dr. gave her a rescue inhaler to use for that first month or so. She's great now. Congrats on being past day. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Thanks for the info jillar It s nice to have a place to just vent and get things on your chest. [SEP]', '[CLS] I concur with Jillar there are several things you will go thru the first several days off of cigarettes. The fatigue got to me a bit did not expect it, what I did was rest. Again drink lots of fluids cold if you can and use deep breathing techniques they really help. Again check out the site and all of its information as it can really help you understand what is going on. If anything seems really out of place it cannot hurt to discuss with your doctor. Congrats on the first day. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Shortness of breath, I had it too. Mine was anxiety related. Quitting scared the hell out of me. It lasted a while, diminished and came back again. Its a proces. Do some research to what causes it, maybe visit your doctor if you dont trust it. And try concious breathing. See it as an opportunity to learn something about yourself, rather than something that has to get out of the way Just to clarify, have you quit 'officially' now If so, good for you, congrats on your decision Edited July by MLMR.

Glad you have put the smokes down all together because that's what is required not only to break free from your addiction but as well to get through all these early quit symptoms you are experiencing. Now that you are not smoking at all, the true healing can begin. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Diane, so glad you are finally quit. Hunker down and stay strong.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] Congratulations on the quit. Two quick observations  First, maybe think about trying to force yourself to go to the gym despite the fatigue. Sometimes exercise can be an energy producer instead of an energy consumer, and you may feel better as a result of going. Second, definitely don't be alarmed if your energy is not back to normal in a couple of days, as you mention in your initial post of this thread. Recovery can be a long process and given how long most of us smoked, the toxicity of the chemicals we've ingested, and the habits we've ingrained, it would actually be surprising if this weren't the case.

This is from the FDA Drug Safety site, Patients taking Chantix should contact their health care professional if they experience new or worsening symptoms of cardiovascular disease, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, calf pain when walking, or sudden onset of weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking. Patients should also contact their health care professional if they have any questions or concerns Here is more information from Chantix Stay aware and alert. I was so excited that you had quit, I forgot you were on Chantix. There are more complicated things to be aware of with a drug like that.

I don t think I need it for a full months. Hi Diane, I am no expert in Chantix, wouldnt know if thats the wisest thing to do quit early . Like Jillar said, Ive also heard from people who went straight back to smoking after quitting the program early. I went cold turkey, but I did have some time frame in mind. No worries about over eating the first month, shifting focus to exercize only after months i tried walking daily though, from the nd month or so , making sure I celebrated every milestone and counting weeks on a calender. I wanted to have a grip on my first year and I was well aware of all the triggers patterns both daily, seasonal, mental and many others to overcome. This time frame helped me a great deal. I am not one for NRT's, but I can imagine that the programs that often come with it, like with Champix or patches, can be helpful. Working towards something.

When I smoke I can t do all the workouts I like. I love spin classes but no way you can do that and be a smoker. Of course I changed the place I went. In the beginning I just made it hard to find places to smoke. That helps if I m out having a few drinks with friends. Most of my friends don t smoke. So that is helpful. Even when I smoke I don t like the smell and I can always smell it. When I don t smoke I can really smell everything so much better. I went out with a few friends that at the time where smokers and it was a bar you could smoke in. The is how I started again too many drinks and friends with cigarettes that didn t talk me down. Today I don t go out drinking like I did than. One I can t drink like that now. I have type diabetes. Two I m year older so out drinking like that doesn t do it for me. I ve made a lot of life style changes. So this is the last one. So I guess I m just doing the things I know worked last time. [SEP]', '[CLS] Sazerac believe me I know it wasn t a successful quit.

I eventually grew to think of smoking as living under a dark cloud literally and figuratively of negativity, isolation and poison. I wanted out of that. When quitting, I really tried to focus on the positive. In time, you will see that smoking does absolutely nothing positive for you whatsoever. There is no negative in quitting.

You just do not smoke. You were not born as a smoker, so your brain in both conscious and inconscious manners has memory of how life was without cigarettes. Just because you learned how to be a smoker, does not mean that forever you are to be a slave to the addiction. It takes time for your brain to return to handling life without cigarettes, but it will. It did it before you became a smoker, and it will do it again now that you have quit. Just be patient, and most important thing is to not be afraid of nicotine addiction. It is not a monster hiding and waiting to get you. It has no intelligence. And no power. You control the it . As long as you do not put nicotine in your body again, it will stay asleep. Crist bal.

I let a bit of time pass and last week I listened to Bootcamp again. I got so much out of it this time so many Ah ha moments.

No depression. No anger. I was great I was happy Then out of the blue I lit a cigarette some hrs of being free . I had no cravings to do this, no triggers, no stress. I have no idea why I did this. I went back to listening to Bootcamp again and I have no Ah Ha moments. I understand since I've listened to this a few times it will be anti climatic but I can't find what I missed that made me light up again.

Addiction and conditioning combine to make smoking a cigarette your default setting. On day two of a quit, it can require a deliberative mental effort to refrain from lighting up. You were just beginning the process, it takes time and repetition before not smoking becomes your new normal. All of the programs, books, and information can facilitate the process of quitting.

I'm not sure who or what I am suppose to follow. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I didn't read Easy Way peepers but I can tell you that mindset plays a big part in how your quit goes. My first few months were pretty hard but I also dwelled on how hard it was. Others who were just done smoking had a much easier time. I quit because my health was suffering and had to. It wasn't so much wanting to as it was being ready to, if that makes sense. Maybe someone who's read the book will comment to your question. I don't see though how anyone gets away from cigarettes without some sort of withdrawal recovery symptoms . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] There are many paths to the center. The point of providing choices is everybody is different and will build their quit in their own unique way. Some swear by Alan Carr, others resonate with Joel Spitzer, some find guidance through other quitting methods. I quit cold turkey, that is my experience but, there are many successful quitters here who found NRT's helpful. There is NO one way, no right way, no magic bullet, except tocommit to never taking another puff, and it has been my experience, that educating myself about nicotine addiction, especially the science of it, helped me understand what I was going through and empowered me to keep my quit. I read Alan Carr, watched all of Joel Spitzer's videos and lurked here and there to learn everything I could. I am still learning.

Books, videos and quit aid products are all well and fine but it always boils down to personal commitment to quit smoking. Without that commitment, you can not be successful It does boil down to commitment, I agree. I get where the folks who are struggling to keep a commitment. I felt as though I had two warring personalities, one that wanted to keep the commitment, the other easily overpowering it with the promise of easing the panic that something terrible was going to happen to my kids, or that I'd make a fatal mistake at work and lose my job. All that panic the result of craving nicotine, but my commitment wilted in the face of the anxiety. I can't count the times I threw away cigarettes and lighters, said, that's it and hours, days, or weeks later I blithely and without a specific trigger trotted off to the store for cigarettes. I don't know what was wrong with me. There has to be motivation to state, I'm committed, and ongoing motivation to keep that commitment. I tried vitamins, Tony Robbins, a book, What to say when you talk to yourself, nicotine replacement, self hypnosis suggestion, meditation I can't remember what else. It was all in the service of trying to stay committed. It was as though I was only reaching one aspect of my personality, with the addicted aspect unaffected. When I was successful for days or weeks, I don't really know where I found the motivation to stay abstinent for those periods of time, but made it only hours other times. I agree, it does boil down to commitment. It's been staying motivated that has been lacking for me to keep that commitment. I feel committed now because the specter of encroaching blindness looms on my horizon. In the mind of a person who keeps the commitment, is there perhaps a consciously or subconsciously held picture sounds feelings that are more powerful than addiction.

Thanks Most people who quit smoking do not use a forum, or study ways to quit. They simply make a decision to Never Take Another Puff , and then keep the commitment with themselves. A big danger of studying different ways of quitting is to believe that studying is what will keep your quit. It does not. What is missing from your quit, is that you have not yet made your commitment to Never Take Another Puff . It does not make any difference how many times you read Alan Carr's or EasyWay materials or watch Joel Spitzer's videos, or use nicotine patches, nicotine gum, Chantix, accupuncture, hypnosis  Without this commitment, you will always fail. That is the answer, to your question what I am missing to free me from this slavery . Avoid analysis paralysis . The very tall quit smoking mountain you think is front of you, is a illusion.

Talking to people on QuitTrain can be helpful. However, no matter what anyone says, and irrespective of the methods books videos NRTetc  used to quit smoking, one has to make a commitment to oneself not to smoke. It takes courage as well. You may be scared as to not knowing how you will be to handle life as an ex smoker. You may be scared to throw out all your smoking paraphernalia. You may be scared not knowing how you will carry out your day to day routine without smoking. Although easier said than done, take quitting smoking in your stride and work through it an hour and a day at a time. Keep yourself busy with activities. Drink plenty of juice and water during the first days. Take the NOPE pledge on the forum, it helps. When I do get a crave, I admit to myself I need a smoke, but I also say to myself that I'm not going to submit to it. Personally, I never read any books wr t quitting smoking, I just watched Joel's videos and talked to people on QuitTrain. I also take the NOPE pledge everyday. I also stuck as many post its I could that say Never Take Another Puff all over my room, and the post its still remain to this day.

I m get closer to not having another puff Edited July by Diane R. [SEP]', \"[CLS] You're well on your way, Diane I didn't use Chantix but I did cut down and practice not smoking in various situations for quite a while prior to actually quitting. This method isn't recommended by most people, but I was such a heavy smoker for years and was used to smoking everywhere house, car, outside of work, etc. so cutting back and getting used to not always being able to smoke was a huge help for me. I imagine cutting back with Chantix helps in somewhat the same way, with the big bonus of making you have less desire to smoke. Whatever works for you is the best way to get through this, and it sounds as if you are determined to make this your final quit. We'll be rooting you on all the way.

I'm going to one of my recovery meetings at noon where many people smoke and its sort of normalized but I'll be with a nonsmoking family member so I won't be tempted to bum one. I'll do my best to remember why I'm quitting, look at smoking as something horrible and destructive that endangers my life instead of romancing it. Thats what it will take when I'm at a meeting. Its NOT okay, its NOT normal , its NOT something that I do because everyone else is doing it, I will NOT push down the fear and knowledge that I'm endangering my life. I will remember why I'm doing this, and so will ya'll.

Who cares if it looks silly and it probably doesn't because I think most people know its a substitute for a cig.

I ignored them because I was frightened. I was frightened of failing. So, I would laugh, I would tell people 'Live life Enjoy every moment We all have to die some time of something.' I bought Allen Carrs book 'the EasyWay' and I read it. Not for the first time I sat down and really thought about smoking. About mortality. I thought about my wife. About how she had moved away from her beloved London and her beloved family to support me and my work. I thought about COPD. I thought about my wife as a carer. I thought about dying. I though about my wife all alone. I decided that I was right. We do all have to die of something. We should enjoy every moment. Did I really enjoy smoking Did I need to hurry my death along No. And No. I simply followed the instructions in the book. I chose a date. I committed to quitting smoking and celebrating that quit immediately. I quit on vacation. My wife still smoked. So on the first morning, after breakfast, we carried on our routine and went up to the terrace for our after breakfast cigarette and espresso the obvious difference being that I did not smoke. She was worried, watching me from the corner of her eye. Me I was fine. I quit. As the vacation continued, my wife decided that she would quit too, and smoke her last cigarette before we got the flight home. Did I crave Yes. Sometimes. Did I sometimes rely on support from like minded people online Yes mostly lunatics here . How do I feel now Absolutely fantastic.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] I was self motivated for the first week. I quit just to see if I could.Then, I 'discovered' Joel's videos, they are now on site HERE .Once I educated myself about my addictionthere was simply no turning back.I had many patterns to change and one by one was able to dissociate the tobacco habit from my life, sometimes by tricking myself, sometimes through education, sometimes through fierce will, and sometimes just slogging through one more smoke free day.Commitment to NOPE and education were two major motivations .

I like breathing, and I am too damn smart to be standing there hacking and desperately trying to take a drag,looking like a sick fool instead of in the hospital getting better.

Instead I heard there is some very slight hemorrhaging from the diabetes in both eyes . When I went home, I researched how to stop the progression of this eye vessel hemorrhaging and everything I read said QUIT SMOKING DO NOT SMOKE NO SMOKING. So, since I value my eyesight, I decided to make a plan that day. My family and I were going on a cruise vacation to the Pacific Northwest in mid May, and I vowed that when I came back from vacation I would quit that weekend. I chose to use an e cigarette to quit. I had tried every method out there except drugs like Chantix and never succeeded much beyond a day or two. I also knew in my mind and heart and soul that I had to succeed this time in order to improve things for my health. I did quit that weekend, and I have not had not one puff since then. I do still use an e cig perhaps not as often as I did in the beginning. I do not use nicotine in my e juice, just the juice. When I'm stressed or just getting a craving which are getting very weak now , it's there and I use it. I have been nicotine free for months and plan to continue the remainder of my life. I know at some point I will stop with the e cigarette as well, but until I feel confident I can go without it, I will continue with it. I hope this helps someone out there who is trying to decide to quit or not. Quitting was the best decision and best action I've ever taken in my life.

I actually smoked my last one at pm that Saturday at my mom's. Then that was it. I was a non smoker the next day when I woke up, and have been ever since.

I chain smoked when I wasn't at work. Last time i wondered what it would be like to do something big, my life changed for the better. So I was gonna quit on Oct nd but of course it only lasted four hours. I thought, Alright, I will allow myself three cigarettes a day down from but Friday I need to quit quit. I gave away the rest of my smokes about three packs worth , got rid of my cigarette machine one of those top o matic type machines and cigarette tubes, and that Friday Oct at AM, took my last hit. I was highly motivated to quit. I was having problems breathing, I was coughing a lot, breath rattling at night worse than ever, I was scared. I used to joke that I would probably die by age . But that meant less than years to live, if my guesstimate were accurate. If the minutes off your life per cigarette average is anywhere close to true, I have lost about three years. No big deal but the years I am around will be better without smoking those stupid ass cigarettes.

After doing this a few times, i again was on the way home and looked to see again I had three left. This time I forgot to get the carton. I was out on my deck. I looked up and asked God for the strength to make the decision. I promised i would go through it all on my own if he just helped me decide. BOOM I felt it immediately.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Do I want to eat Or do I want a smoke. [SEP]', '[CLS] I never got that bad, but sitting down and realizing my cigarette bill and my rent were both taking up of my income did the trick. I was great at living on the cheap except for one line item . [SEP]', '[CLS] Could of just ate the cigarettes ya know, win win situation. [SEP]', '[CLS] I had to make a similar choice when I was around . Unfortunately I chose smoking over eating. I lost lbs in months. Still a smoker though. I made the wrong choice. [SEP]', '[CLS] Choose between smoking or eating You could never be a model. [SEP]', '[CLS] I know many people who would choose the smokes . [SEP]', '[CLS] This. The moment I had to choose between having lunch or buying a pack, that was when I stopped. Amazing how much money I wasted on that vice . [SEP]', \"[CLS] You didn't eat the cigarettes, did you. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Started to eat the cigarettes. Brillant save Time and money. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I choose smoking over eating all the time you're comment makes feel stupid. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Similar story, except I just got fired and couldn't afford cigarettes OR food. I had read about the master cleanse fast and decided that was the time to try it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I had some nicotine patches left over from a previous quit attempt and wore them while fasting. By day three, the nicotine was overwhelming me I'd get dizzy and had to take the patch off. Never smoked again. Apparently the fast made me overly sensitive to the nicotine. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Funny thing was, I wasn't trying to quit, just get by until my last check arrived, but that was the quit that worked permanently. [SEP]\", '[CLS] So  what did you choose. [SEP]', '[CLS] I work with the low income population, and I have seen so many people make teh other choice. I have no money, please give me food. However, they have a pack of cigarettes. For some people it seems as necessary as rent. I make a month. My rent is , cigarettes are so I only have left over for everything else. [SEP]', '[CLS] One time I had to choose between dinner or cigarettes and I chose cigarettes. [SEP]', '[CLS] Dude, the exact same situation here. [SEP]', '[CLS] Bleh, I justified the appetite suppressant effect as being cheaper than smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] to cut out two meals a day Ok. [SEP]', '[CLS] Then I learned to make cheaper food. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I was kinda broke too when I quit smoking, but after you factored in the increased need for groceries since everything tastes AMAZING when you stop committing taste bud genocide , I don't think I came out much ahead. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is the exact reason why I'm quitting. Today is day. [SEP]\", '[CLS] So you decided to eat the cigarettes. [SEP]', '[CLS] Came here to say this. [SEP]', '[CLS] I only quit due to lack of money and little willpower. Never ever smoking again. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I wish this would work for my sister's husband. I'm constantly sending money their way and ordering pizza for her and her kids because they're so low on money lately. But they never have a shortage of Marlboro reds and Energy Drinks . [SEP]\", '[CLS] In college, my girlfriend lived with a girl who was getting a monthly student grant, which she would proceed to without fail blow within the first two weeks of the month. It would then pass that she would have to make a choice between food and cigarettes. She would choose cigarettes. [SEP]', '[CLS] I came here to say, money. [SEP]', '[CLS] People are being taxed out. Not to mention some employers offer healthcare premium reductions. [SEP]', '[CLS] That shit adds up fast, especially when something in the budget has to go. [SEP]', '[CLS] Why not just eat the tobacco then run to bring it to a burn. [SEP]', '[CLS] Lol im there now and im still choosing cigarettes P. [SEP]', '[CLS] I was poor. I had to decide between eating, smoking, or paying bills. I chose smoking because it curbed my appetite and at the time was cheaper than eating. [SEP]', '[CLS] Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels. [SEP]', '[CLS] That was going to be my call too. [SEP]', '[CLS] Almost the same thing here,gave myself an ultimatum.i wanted a new truck but with smoking i wasnt going to be able to make the payments on it,so i had to choose a new truck or blackened lungs. I love my truck and its been a year since i last smoked. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Yep, that's why I quit. Once I realized that I'd made the decision to eat rather than smoke and I was smoking hand rolled at the time anyways, couldn't even afford those I just started working on a hatred for the things I watched The Insider great film, especially if you need a reason to hate Big Tobacco and researched a bunch of facts on cigarettes online. [SEP]\", '[CLS] You should have compromised and ate your cigarettes. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Money is a big factor, but I quit cold turkey after smoking for years. I've been without a cigarette for almost years now and I can't stand the smell of cigarettes. Just find a vice, mine is working out, along with changing your habits. If you usually go outside for a smoke on your lunch then stay inside. Just stay away from temptations. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Eat the cigarettes. Problem solved. [SEP]', '[CLS] Poverty for me, too. The winter electric bill came and I had no way to pay for it, so I quit smoking. I used the patch for a little while to give myself time to get past the habit before I worked on the nicotine addiction. I also quit with a friend and relied on my spiritual beliefs, both of which were helpful. [SEP]', '[CLS] So, I guess it was the combination of peer support, spiritual internal coping, nicotine replacement, and being too broke to buy cigarettes. Quit years this past November. [SEP]', '[CLS] I did the same thing with WoW. [SEP]', '[CLS] This is the only reason I have managed to give up for the last weeks. [SEP]', '[CLS] So many time I chose smoking over eating . [SEP]', '[CLS] I just gave up fruit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I've chosen to smoke in that situation. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This right here, I had the same issue its been a little over a month now but yeah to choose between gas and food or smokes and food had to make a call. [SEP]', '[CLS] This will never work for me  I roll my own and pay a carton. [SEP]', '[CLS] Exact same thing happened to me, here and i ran out of money. Only when you have no money does spending every few days seem stupid. [SEP]', \"[CLS] It's sad that I have chosen the smoking over food many times. It is terrible and silly in retrospect. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I know choosing between cigs and food is a great way to lose weight, but this is a stop smoking thread. [SEP]', '[CLS] So, you chose eating cigarettes And you hit a rough nicotine patch. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Pussy, back in 'Nam I had to eat my cigarettes. [SEP]\", '[CLS] So, which one did you choose. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Fell in love with a girl who didn't smoke. Simple as that  I got self conscious about my breath and teeth and the smell of my clothes. I wanted her to want to kiss me all the time. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That, and she never pressured me to quit. She just said smoke or don't smoke, but quit acting like you want to stop and then buying more. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Sometimes, I still have one when I'm really stressed. Finals week, etc. It's easy to stop there when you don't want to be a smoker anymore. I barely enjoy them now. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Yeah man exactly how I did it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The girl's gone now, but so are the cigarettes. I'm happy with that result. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit for a girl. Then a year later she broke my heart and my house got burglarized. Aaaaaaaaaand I started smoking again. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I have been vaping for the last months and I think I'm done with ciggys. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Man I'm a shit girlfriend. I want my boyfriend to quit so bad and I bug him to stop quite a bit I need to lay off and let him do it in his own time. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My girlfriend does smoke and I'm trying to quit. I haven't had one since yesterday, but I don't know how well this is gonna work out. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My story, exactly Except I'm a girl and he's a boy. He never pressured me into anything and I think that propelled me into wanting to quit. My ex would force me to stop smoking and that just made me want to smoke more. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Same with my dad. He quit once my mom was pregnant with me. It worked out well because I didn't know he was a heavy smoker till years later. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Yeah I'm going thru that right now. She doesn't care if I smoke or not. But when I do it causes her to have coughing fits and I feel like a terrible person. I'm still struggling but I haven't bought a pack in weeks. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] No judgement here I don't have a problem with people who smoke or anything , but I would say be a little careful with the very occasional smoke attitude . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] As someone who used to smoke and doesn't anymore let me just say that for years I would smoke very occasionally, maybe at a bar with friends, or at stressful times, etc. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] And a bit later, in a new city, I was regularly playing music with a bunch of people who smoked, and I'd occasionally bum a cigarette at practice. And feeling self conscious about always taking them from my friends, I started to buy packs again, though not regularly. But slowly it became more common, and I basically started smoking again. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I managed to catch it but I definitely found that the once in a while thing was, for me, not actually a good idea. I've properly quit for many years now and now have a child, which I think really cemented it for me, though I'd already stopped by then . [SEP]\", '[CLS] Even now I still occasionally feel the urge in certain circumstances, especially after a couple of beers, especially with people who smoke . [SEP]', \"[CLS] Yup, for me it was my boyfriend who is now my husband. I only smoked for about a year a couple of months. Started on my th birthday and met him at . Having someone you really like pull away from kissing you abruptly because of the intense smell taste of cigarettes is a REALLY good motivator to stop. He never started smoking because his mom used to say It's so stupid, and it looks stupid. Think about it. You're rolling up a bunch of dead grass, putting it in your mouth, and lighting it on fire Imagine saying that in a Bronx NY classic Italian mother's accent . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] But, at least in my case, quitting was easy because a I had support from someone I truly liked and respected, and b I'll occasionally by that I mean once every months will smoke hookah or the celebratory cigar recreationally. It's something you can share with smoker and non smoker friends alike. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'm surprised you even would notice that. When I smoked I never knew my clothes would stink and my breath was bad. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It wasn't until after I quite smoking and would be next to someone who did, that it dawned on me that I must have stunk that bad. The smell on clothes was very powerful too. But I guess because I was used to the smoke, I would never notice it on me. [SEP]\", '[CLS] My girlfriend quit when we started dating. I love the hell out of her. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Funny, my dear girlfriend who I have been with for almost two years has been a smoker since we met, and that's how I started. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Thanks for helping me to realize the inspiration I've needed. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I met a girl about a year ago, and it's been getting fairly serious over the past couple months. I know she would love for me to quite, but hasn't really pressured me about it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'm flying half way across the country to see her in a couple weeks. I think I've just found a pretty great Valentines Day gift. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It's amazing how quickly we begin to care about things when you find something or someone you want to be with. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Don't you find though that after not having one for a long time when you do it is the most awful tasting thing and you have a few puffs then put it out in disgust I know I tried one after about a year of none and that is what I thought. [SEP]\", '[CLS] are you my clone . [SEP]', \"[CLS] Man, you did it for a girl You're going to spark up the moment you break up. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I have the opposite story. I am a girl and fell in love with my boyfriend, who doesn't smoke. He did not pressure me at all, but was very supportive when I was trying to cut down. He encouraged me, but didn't guilt trip me when I slipped. I didn't do cold turkey, I started with reducing to cigs a day for a few days, then , then , then , then . I literally had a cigarette that I would only puff a couple of times from and then re light it later. Slowly, i quit. I also got a new car and it really motivated me not to smoke while driving, which was probably the hardest challenge. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] When my fiance met me and we had gone on a 'date' or two, I straight up told him I wouldn't give him the time of day anymore unless he stopped. He stopped. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I would like to commend you for that. I recently dated a girl that smoked while drinking. And every time she would drink then she'd get horny, and I couldn't stand to kiss her after and I asked her nicely many times to stop, and to not carry around cigs every where she went. Neither happened and we broke up. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Same. I fell in love with my boyfriend, and no one in his family smoked. Whenever I would go out for one, and come into his moms place, she would politely ask me if I could just stand outside for a few minutes so that I don't smell of it. I became self concious, and I could tell that he didn't enjoy kissing me after I had one. [SEP]\", '[CLS] People always told me that you need to quit for yourself. I never could. He was the only thing that made me want to. . years later, I made the right choice. [SEP]', '[CLS] I have a friend who smoked and has a gf, she told him its me or the smokes he quit and she found out by some well placed info. They are still together and I believe he quit for good now. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That happened on both ends of the spectrum for me. If I was with a girl that smoked, I smoked. If she didn't, I didn't. But most of them did so whatever lol. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Mine was similar. First date with my now husband I was walking up with a cigarette hanging out of my mouth. He said, Oh, you smoke. I put out the cigarette and said, Not any more. I had one more about a year later that was disgusting, but I finished. I then had about of another a few years later and put it out. Frankly, I loved smoking, and now I think they are positively disgusting. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I wish my boyfriend was self conscious about his breath and teeth. Frankly, he doesn't care because he already has me. I don't like kissing him. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I told him to quit once and he snapped at me. Haven't told him to quit again, but he knows I want him to. He says he wants to, but who really knows. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I want a girl should i start smoking then quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Similar story. I fell head over heels for a girl, and noticed that she had taken to smoking when she was around me. I realized then that either I had to quit, or she would start. We're no longer together, and I've since found out that she has again started smoking. It breaks my heart to think she unknowingly changed my life for the better and I can't return the favor . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Same here, partner didn't care either way but hated my being wishy washy about it. I still have one once in a while bummed one on my birthday, had a drag of a friend's at a holiday party but I don't really like the smell or get anything from it now, and it makes me feel like shit the next day. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I had to give up one of my favorite hobbies for a while though. I couldn't go to the bar and play pool without wanting to go have a cigarette between games with the rest of the pool playing folk. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Similar story here. I met this girl last spring, long story short, I realized very quickly that I liked her a lot. She friend zoned me, but I couldn't help it, I still really liked her. I knew she hated smoking, so I never did it around her and always tried to cover up that I still smoked. I told myself that if anything ever did finally happen between us, I would just quit straight up. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It finally happened just before Christmas. I love her very much and I haven't touched a cigarette since. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My dad smoked a lot until he met my mom. She didn't tell him to stop just that she didn't like the smell. He's been cigarette free and married years. He still wakes up from time to time craving a smoke. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] As a chubby, pasty nerd obsessed with Middle earth I might as well just start dating cigarettes. At least they don't judge me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is actually the reason why I won't start. I was about to pick it up, just to try it out and the sort. Met an amazing girl who absolutely hated smoking, made a promise to her that I wouldn't even try it. Working pretty well so far. [SEP]\", '[CLS] My husband still smokes. He keeps saying he is going to quit, years in. I am anosmic no sense of smell at all , but he knows because of that I am super paranoid about me and my stuff smelling like smoke. He is down to three a day, and has an ecig, but just refuses to let go. I never pressured or even asked him to stop the first couple years, because when we first met he said he would be quitting in a couple years . About a year ago I started asking him to stop. Not all the time, about once a month. We started rationing he was doing a day half of those straight after work shooting the shit with the guys chefs on his own, so we took it down to six at first, then every six weeks or so took one away. Got to per day about five months ago and he refuses to go any lower, but I havent brought it up for a few months. [SEP]', '[CLS] It breaks my heart. I just wish he would stop already, but I know pressuring isnt thew ay to go about it. [SEP]', '[CLS] I barely enjoy them now. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That was the key for me. One one of my last cigarettes, I sat there thinking I'm not really enjoying this anymore. I finished that pack and quit cold turkey. years later, I still get small cravings, especially if I've been drinking or if I'm around smokers, but other than that I haven't looked back. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Be careful not to fall into old habits with those finals. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I can really relate to the easy to stop when you dont want to be a smoker part. I've always enjoyed other things like hookah smoke because it tastes good and I just enjoy smoking so one day I picked up cigs and just really didn't like it. Kept it up for like months and just stopped randomly. A few months later I started again for a while and stopped. Getting an ecig cut the few months on and off cycle because I can still play with the and have something that tastes good. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Okay  Just realized I am smoking while reading this thread. Than your comment was the only one to get to me  I want my gf to want to kiss me too. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Fell in love with a girl who didn't smoke. Simple as that . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] But if you'd stick with doing anal, she wouldn't smell you anyway, silly sir. Too bad you never thought about that. I'm sure your sorry now. [SEP]\", '[CLS] So for those weighing their options between falling in love or getting an ecig, where do you find a girl for online. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My boyfriend told me that he used to smoke and I didn't want to be the reason why he began again, so I quit. It's been months. I've struggled a lot, but he's worth it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] However, if we ever break up, I have a feeling I'd probably buy a pack immediately. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This is actually really cute and inspirational. I wish my partner would do the same. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My boyfriend says he quit for me, but I didn't pressure him to. When I was , my mother died of lung cancer caused by a lifetime of smoking. It was hard for me to see my boyfriend smoke, but I never complained or told him he had to quit. After we'd been dating for about months I finally got up the courage to say I was afraid of something happening to him. He said he had been waiting for me to say something about it. He threw out his cigarettes that night and hasn't smoked since. He said it was realizing he had someone in his life who he didn't want to hurt gave him the strength to quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I started dating someone who didn't smoke and hated the taste, urging me to do the same. A year later I had successfully quit and she had started up I still don't know how or why that happened. Breaks my heart watching her spark up. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit for a girl also. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I was trying to be healthy with what i ate and everything too, but really I just didn't want her to know that I hadn't quit after two years. Esp when trying to eat healthy and be a better person. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I bought a pack when things got rough with her, both out of spite and to have a crutch, but they weren't the same and I knew I didn't want to start again. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My mom got my dad to quit smoking by betting him that he couldn't. He finished the cigarette he was smoking and then quit cold turkey. My mom quit, too. Would be a pretty adorable story except they both started smoking again when they got divorced. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'm not in love, but same deal. I didn't want to smell or have awful breath around him because he was a pretty straight edge guy with drinking being the exception . I never really felt addicted though, like I HAD to have one. It was when I was bored or needed to think. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My bf is currently going through thid with me for the second time. The first, we had a pack a day smoker roommate and that made it impossible. I reassured him that if he was ready to quit it would be for him and I'd support him either way.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] I wish that worked for my boyfriend. He's trying I never pressure him but it really bothers me in a lot of ways. I watched my grandfather die and watched my grandmother watch him die due to emphysema and it's something I never want to go through. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My husband quit because I told him when we met that I wouldn't date a smoker. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] so that's kind of interesting. I fell in love with a girl who didn't smoke, but always begged me to quit. after or so years with her I finally did after many times explaining that her being so persistent didnt help matters I quit. when we broke up, I immediately started chain smoking probably mostly because she asked me not to and I was petty about it. I finally quit for real when I actually got over her, which was around the time I realized I wanted to be awesome by my own account, not by anyone else's. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Came here to say this. Problem is though, is that unlike some other people here, if we broke up I would probably go right back to it. Don't think that's going to happen though no jinxies . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The only time I've dated a chain smoker I got If you bug me about smoking, or try to get me to quit, I'll break up with you very early on in the relationship. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This exact reason is how I see myself quitting. Once I meet my girl I'm done. I've quit many times unsuccessfully before so I'm very confident I'll be able to do it. Until then  I guess I'll just be another typical smoker, shrugs. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I gotta buddy that's doing the same thing and I don't even think he knows it We've been on him to quit for years but he just keeps on puffing. Now that he's not smoking near as much, we're all keeping quiet and hoping it sticks haha. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I had a girl, that pressured me all the time and that just made me want to smoke more. Or even hide the fact I was smoking, that being said pressuring someone is not the way to go when you want someone to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] This is a real thing you can cut waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyy back. For me, it was easier to never announce I was quitting, but just sort of procrastinate that next stress cigarette. [SEP]', \"[CLS] It's easy to stop there when you don't want to be a smoker anymore. I barely enjoy them now. [SEP]\", '[CLS] And the girl What happened to here Was it worth it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I've wanted to quit forever, I'm currently using non smoking new girlfriend as an excuse.

You'll quickly realize that they don't last very long and are very expensive, so immediately start looking into other options. Look online, or at your local tobacconist. Some people like no hassle solutions like White Cloud or V e cigs, where you just recharge the battery and replace the pre filled cartridges when they run out. I don't. I would recommend a starter kit like an eGo or an eVod that lets you fill your own cartridges with a juice of your choice. I like the Vapor Zeus from Vapor Life. When you're ready, you can then step up to mechanical mods, where you're recharging batteries, filling your own tanks, and rebuilding your own atomizers. The point is that it becomes less and less expensive, and you'll figure out how to get a quality vape that you really enjoy. The world of vaping and e cigs can be very confusing just keep doing your research and you'll learn it all in time. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The important thing is to just start down the path. Quit now.

Only thing is I saw him walking up the street before I was done so I just put it out. He ended up seeing a half unsmoked cigarette put out in his astray. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That's the last memory related to my father smoking that I have though. Since then I have probably had cigarettes I'm now , just never had the desire but I can see how easy it is to begin. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Exactly what happened to my grandfather. He saw my cousin who was seven at the time pick up one of his cigarettes and put it in his mouth. My grandfather snatched it up from him and took the pack and threw it away. Quit cold turkey just like that. [SEP]', '[CLS] Similar for me. Wife was pregnant with our first child and the thought of something like that got me to quit.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] When I was in elementary school, I was going through the DARE Drug Abuse Resistance Education , and realized that what my mother had been doing could possibly kill her and it was hurting me too. So, my plan of action was to crush her cigarettes into mush and dump them in the trash every time I found her packs. Eventually, she gave up buying them and trying to hide them because she realized what I was doing was good for her, would save money, and she hasn't smoked since. It's been over twelve years.

I had patients on NRT nicotine replacement therapy , buproprion Zyban , e cigarettes technically not a true quitting agent , and Chantix. Some of my patients were ex cocaine and heroin addicts which they claimed was easier to give up than smoking. Out of this, the most success I had with getting people to quit was in pregnant women, or people with children going cold turkey. The risk of harming your child is a powerful motivator.

He's cancer free now, so no worries But the type of cancer he had was genetic. It happened at the chromosomal level, and he really didn't have a choice in the matter.

My father died of cancer when I was and my little brother was . It was heartbreaking.

Well, she had the ashtray on the patio table and one of my littler cousins picked out a butt and went up to grandma smiling saying I can do it too . Grandmother gasped threw her carton right in the trash along with all the ashtrays, said Grandma has been doing a bad thing and never smoked again. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Similar story. My year old daughter asked if she could have a cigarette. And this was after I had gone to great lengths hiding my smoking from her as best as I could. I never smoked in front of her, but I guess she figured out why the car smelled funny and why I was going outside every hour or so for minutes. [SEP]', '[CLS] Quitting cold turkey was the only thing that worked. It was three days of pure hell but after that it was okay.

I didn't even think much about starting up again, but when my kid said that it hit me like a ton of bricks. The best part is after vaping so long the smell bugs me. Its the first time in my life outside of when I was pregnant that I even noticed the smell cigarettes have, because I'd been around it all my life. I don't want that for my son. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Even after that you still had to wait until the next day to quit. Nicotine, man. [SEP]', '[CLS] I love how you quit cold turkey the next day and not the same day. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Exactly this. There is no trick to it, you just have to genuinely and completely WANT to stop. And it's tough, it's many small victories. My first was to resist every time I was in a store to buying a pack at the counter they're RIGHT THERE. Just kept telling myself Nope. There's a reason you want to quit, remember that. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit the day I found out I was pregnant. That was years ago. Nothing like being responsible for the health and life of another being to make you put things into perspective. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That's almost exactly how it went for my dad. When my sister was born, he just quit cold turkey. No gum, no patches, not gradually, no nothing. He just didn't smoke anymore from one day to the next. [SEP]\", '[CLS] My Dad quit when he was holding my brother as a baby, and accidentally burnt him. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I had to Google what cold turkey meant I'm Dutch . I quit smoking weed cold turkey, but I still smoke cigarettes. I will quit someday whenever I really feel like quitting, but for the moment I don't WANT to yet. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I really just needed to truly WANT to quit. If you go into quitting while expecting to put up a fight  you'll win the fight. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Pretty much this, wanting to quit is the main thing. I've tried various things gum, e cgis and the rest but the moment for me was it was either smoking or moving forward with my girlfriend. Its been a month or so now and yes I've slipped but I am determined and I am getting the mental cravings less every day. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Step Can finally quit smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] just kidding, but good for you. [SEP]', \"[CLS] It's like that for a lot of things. Especially fitness. You've got to want it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Yep, I think sometimes having another life to live for increases the value of your own. [SEP]', '[CLS] Exactly the same. My wife quit as soon as she found out she was pregnant, and as soon as her super prego senses developed I was on a clock to quitting . [SEP]', '[CLS] Being told daily, You stink. Go in the other room, is a great motivator. I knew I would need the extra lung capacity to chase after little ones, anyway. [SEP]', \"[CLS] For me it was also having a daughter. When she was with me, of course I wouldn't smoke. When I knew she'd be with me, I wouldn't smoke that day so I wouldn't smell like it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The hardest part was giving up smoking while I was driving. It was a habit I enjoyed most. But if I knew my daughter would be with me, i wouldn't smoke in my car two days before. Overtime, she was with me more and more, I smoked less and less until one day I noticed I wasn't doing it at all any more. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I should add that I also wanted to quit. It made me self conscious at work. During meetings, during conversations with co workers. Smelling like cigarette smoke sucks. [SEP]', '[CLS] I wish my husband did. Daughter is mo old. I make a point every time he comes inside to he better wash his hands AND change his shirt. Sounds like being a bitch, but a newborn does not need to smell that. [SEP]', '[CLS] Right on, brother. The first time my wife got pregnant we hesitated. We only slowed down the smoking. Then we lost the baby. Let me tell you that shit hurt. We cried for quite some time. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The second time we got pregnant we walked outside and had our last cigarette. Now we have a perfect little one year old girl. I don't know if it was the smoking or nature taking it's course. One thing I can say is, fuck I'm happy right now. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Same thing that did it for my dad. He smoked right up until around the time that my mom got pregnant with me, and then she told him that there was no way in hell he was going to smoke with me around, so he stopped. [SEP]', '[CLS] Do you live in Dallas by any chance. [SEP]', '[CLS] Thats how my dad did it, it was in his head that life is about to get to a point where hes gonna let go of some habits. He cared , so he stopped instantly. Never did smoke a thing, except meat, for the past years. Now hes , has a damm admirable charisma, being hes a CDL driver Class A B , but mostly B vehicles . [SEP]', \"[CLS] My wife getting pregnant did it for me too. She was a smoker too, so I stopped to make it easier for her to stop. It was the hardest but probably the best thing I've ever done. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Also, I didn't want my kids to be raised in a house of smokers like I was. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This is how I quit Wife told me she was pregnant, So much was going through my mind that I figured, if my life is going to change, I might as well quit this shit and turn myself into someone my child can be proud of. [SEP]', '[CLS] ok, excellent, this is key, I have my notes out. [SEP]', '[CLS] get girl pregnant you will stop smoking cigarettes. [SEP]', '[CLS] yeah , let me tell this to my friend so he will quite smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I haven't smoked a cigarette in over a year. I was a pack a day smoker for around years. I quit cold turkey using the book Alan Carr's easyway to stop smoking. Someone posted it to reddit late one night and I decided fuck it it can't hurt to read it. You are told to smoke at different points throughout the book and then have one last cigarette after you finish the whole book. Well that last cigarette happened to coincide with the last in my pack and the next morning I just wasn't motivated to buy another pack and I haven't since. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I used the same book as did my wife and three friends. Worked immediately and have never looked back. [SEP]', '[CLS] Eight years ago, that was my story as well. [SEP]', '[CLS] My fiancee quit using this book after several years of failed attempts to quit. He only needed to read half the book before he stopped smoking, but finished it anyway. He is now one of the most obnoxious former smokers anyone could meet, and proud of it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Carr's book worked instantly for me too yrs of heavy smoking. Gave it to five or six of my friends. They all quit, too. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Pretty much exactly the same thing happened to me, about years ago. I got it on amazon because I thought, why not Previously I had quit for about a week cold turkey, but after a stressful night at work I picked it up again. [SEP]', '[CLS] The big difference I can see is that many people that quit using other methods are still sneaking cigarettes at times, especially when drinking. I remain repulsed by the very thought of smoking, and will hopefully remain so. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same for me, except I had around smokes left in my pack when I finished the book. Breaking them up and pouring water over them was an amazingly freeing experience. [SEP]', '[CLS] Anybody have the link for it Id love to read it myself. [SEP]', '[CLS] Of all my friends that have quit smoking, the ones that used the book smoke the fewest cigarettes. as in none, versus everyone else still bumming sneaking smokes. [SEP]', \"[CLS] There's something to be said for being satisfied and confident in your decision, I wouldn't want to not smoke if I felt like I was missing out. Poor bastards. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Everyone should at least give his book a try. [SEP]', '[CLS] I read the Alan Carr Easyway book. It worked for a couple of months and then I was back on the fags. [SEP]', '[CLS] I went to one of the Alan Carr Easyway days. Similar technique to the book but in a room full of people, lead by an ex smoker. It really helped me to stop. I have the occasional smoke, generally when I am too drunk to see straight, but I am confident I will never be a smoker again. It was pretty expensive but not compared to maintaining the habit. [SEP]', '[CLS] days ago I finished this book. I have saved a dollars, and ran around with my year old playing basketball just now. I was able to get my wife pregnant months after I quit AFTER TRYING FOR YEARS Read the book, watch Allen Carr on Youtube. Shit Works . [SEP]', '[CLS] Similarly I had quit watching a video one night that pretty much explained the nicotine triggers. I quit for months after that but stressful job and traveling got me smoking again. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Now I'm free though. Through sheer will. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I used the book to help change my mindset, and haven't smoked in almost a year. I don't miss it at all. I can't help but notice everyone here talking about vaping, but I'm grateful that I didn't trade one method intoducing nicotine into my body for another. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I always feared that I would crave cigarettes for years to come this is absolutely not the case. [SEP]', '[CLS] I did, however, hit a good vaper one time, and had cravings for days. [SEP]', '[CLS] Just ordered this book after reading these comments. Wish me luck. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same here. Piece of cake with this book. I went away for the weekend with some friends, and took the book with me, thinking it was a good time to try because I would be distracted and out of my normal routine. days later, I drove back home hours with a smoker in the back seat and had absolutely no desire. [SEP]', '[CLS] You were a smoker a year ago and you had the username TheDoctorsCompanion. Your account is days old also D. [SEP]', '[CLS] I read this post earlier today, I started the book straight away. I just got to the end of Ch where you are told to have a smoke and think of the taste, texture and what it feels like. Most disgusting smoke I have had since my first. [SEP]', '[CLS] I am reading this book till the end. Thank you in advance. [SEP]', \"[CLS] So I got this book upon a recommendation from a friend. And started reading it, and it was great. I liked it right off the bat because the guy didn't talk about the fact smoking was bad etc, but instead concentrated on the experiences that make up smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Thing is I got through like of the book really quick, and it started scaring me that it was so thin. I mean I felt good about everything I was reading, but this irrational fear that there's no way this is enough to get me to quit gripped. And there's the talk about the ritual at the end. The logic here is silly, I can recognize that, but at the same time I get this fear that this thing isn't substantial enough to do what it advertises. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I've been meaning to get back to it, and do it right. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Just out of curiosity, did you finish this book in one go or break it up as you went through What would you recommend having gone through it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Vaping. I haven't smoked since August and I don't miss it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] AND this is after a year habit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same here. Pack a day down to nothing. Gave up vaping when I weened myself down to zero nicotine juice, and donated my gear to a friend. No smoking or vaping since October No more coughing shit up. [SEP]', '[CLS] Seconded. I tried so many different things to quit, but vaping was the only thing that worked. Almost years and no cigs. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Me and my SO both had been struggling to quit for a few years, then we tried a vapour e cig and we stopped almost instantly. Haven't wanted one for months now.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] years smoking maybe packs a day. weeks smoke free tomorrow. I had tried electronics several times over the years. You basically need to find a good mod and a juice you really like. The Blu shit you see in the gas stations wont do it. The actual quit process took me about a month, but I'm finally totally off tabacco. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] People need to do themselves a favor and spend on a Kanger Evod kit and get a couple different juices. Keep getting different juice until you find one you love. And every time you want to smoke, go outside and puff on that. Eventually you'll want to puff on the ecig, not a real cigarette. Then start puffing it inside. Once you actually enjoy it, you may want to upgrade to a better mod kit, which I have done. I still haven't spent a ton of money, but I know its less than I would have spent on cigarettes. Now I can just get juice every couple weeks for a huge different in money. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I absolutely love a couple juices and I crave those now.

Had switched to cigarellos two years before quitting. I bought a Blu e cig and it was awful. Didn't work at all. Bought a proper vape setup with the help of r electronic cigarette and when I finished my last pack of cigarellos I started vaping. That was several months ago and I'm down to mg and my next bottle will be mg. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It was the easiest bad habit I have ever dropped.

But we figured out that with our starter kits we just paid what we would have spent on cigarettes for the month. Of course subsequent months are much, much cheaper. I use a little over ml of mg juice a week. That feels pricey at a bottle, but since that's replacing a carton for the same length of time it's a big win. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Advice for those wanting to try it, start with the higher nicotine juices. We started at mg. I'm at mg now and looking to lower again soon. We tried once before this with weak gear and weaker juice mg and it just didn't work. Suck it up and drop the money on a big cigar sized ecig. I know it seems like the little ones would be more familiar but trust me, they just aren't up to the task. You also end up spending more on refills.

Find a ecig store and try as many as you need to to find the one that works for you. It may be very different from your cigarette brand. It's simply a different experience than smoking.

I wanted a cigarette every day. I struggled and stayed strong for a year. On exactly the year anniversary, I broke down and started the whole habit back up. Since I started vaping I have not really wanted a cigarette at all. I tried four of them during the last year. None of them got finished and every one of them reminded me of how nasty they are. Without vaping, I guarantee I would still be smoking, and stinking, and coughing, and wheezing. [SEP]', '[CLS] This, Quit days ago. Cravings for a real cigarette were very minimal. This was after years of smoking a pack a day of Marlboro Reds. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same here I used to smoke and dip a lot and switched to ecigs.

As soon as someone lit one up, all I wanted to do was start up again. This is why I started vaping using an electronic cigarette .

The difference between crap equipment and uninspiring juice is so incredible not to mention that people's tastes in the vape world are extremely varied, so you have to find something personally satisfying for you. Don't give up. Trying lots of different types of each juice and equipment is key. I know it can be hard when you want to save money, but put all your would be cigarette money towards vaping and worry about saving after you found something great. Put your guilt aside while vaping and get addicted to it, it's much easier to cut down on vaping than smoking cigarettes in my honest opinion. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Vaping since Feb .

However, i find that the percentage of people who actually quit nicotine this way is very very low. I think the best way to quit with vaping it is to use an e cig with NO nicotine. Otherwise you are doing the exact same habits with the exact same drug with a different tool  except now you can ALSO smoke inside so you learn new habits and smoke more often. Most people who attempt to step down on nicotine levels never do and actually everyone I've seen who started vaping now smokes more cigarettes than they did before as they got used to higher levels of nicotine.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] Another serious question Is vaping actually drug related I mean, I have seen a few local shops selling electronic cigarettes, and the green signs with the rasta flags and pot leaves all over the windows, make me assume that there's more to this than a simple cigarette alternative. Not to mention, the people who like electronic cigarettes seem a little too enthusiastic about them. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My mom won't use electronics because she read somewhere they put poison in it.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] Can confirm, respiratory therapist here. The way I explain it to my patients is imagine the nicotine receptors in your brain are little kids and cigarettes are chocolate. If you've been feeding these kids chocolate and one day say Hey guys, some of you can have chocolate  But most of you can't the kids are gonna be pissed. This is like cutting down on smoking, the receptors in your brain want the nicotine even more because there is a reminder of what they're missing. But if one day you tell the kids NOBODY GETS CHOCOLATE ANYMORE they'll cry for a bit and then get over it.

I have gone months without a cig. The first week or two suck but it gets so much easier after that. [SEP]', '[CLS] As a non native English speaker, I genuinely thought you were about to say something about eating cold turkey and how it would help. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My wife quit cold turkey. She slipped up and had a couple of cigs after that, but never bought another pack. We were dating at the time and she knew that I would prefer if she didn't smoke I don't , so she quit. We had been friends a long time and I never pressured her about it she just knew that's what I would prefer so she did it for me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] At the same time we have friends that have tried to quit multiple times. It just seems like the don't really want to quit when they try. It's more like, Yeah, I should quit, so I'll try, but I still really enjoy smoking. I think having a good reason to quit that really matters to you helps. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Exactly. Cold turkey was the best method. Also stay away from bars for the first week. Also had a calendar with the amount of money i was saving. It helped reinforce going cold turkey.

And I've gotten through every single one of them by simply not smoking. I didn't use gum, or a patch, or an e cig or a line from a book. I simply didn't smoke.

It got to a point where I was having a cigarette and then using my inhaler afterwards. I was like why the fuck am I even doing this to myself, so I quit cold turkey and it's the best decision I've ever made. After a week or so it got much easier. I miss cigs occasionally, when I drink mainly, so I don't do that much anymore either. A friend of mine says she wants to quit but when she tries she just goes right back to it.

And then right before I smoked the last one, I put the cigarette, and lighter in the pack and threw it out the window while I was driving. Don't ask me why I did that, I have no idea. But I haven't touched one since then. It's was hell for about two weeks, but then it wasn't so bad. I hardly ever even think about smoking anymore, and it's unbelievable to me that I lived so long smelling like that, just yesterday someone walked past me smoking and it almost made me sick.

Well, maybe not easy , but it became clear that it was the only way. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Agreed, i have only been able to quit with this method.

It's been almost five years, now. She used to get really sick a few times every winter, to the point of being unable to get out of bed. Since she stopped smoking, she hasn't gotten sick like that once. Now she's feeling better than ever, and was able to take a more active job. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I know a guy who quit cold turkey in his s after having smoked since a teenager. One day that was it. No more. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same here. Just one day just quit and never looked back. I also think studies showed within hours the nicotine in your body is already out and cravings should be reduced. [SEP]', '[CLS] Honestly, I quit the same way I had smoked for about years steadily and noticed I was short of breath all the time, and at times just felt like crap. I had to end it. I decided my vice was the gas station. Instead of going in to pay for petrol, I paid at the pump. Not going inside helped immensely. I just basically removed myself from being able to buy them. I quit in February and have only had a few with friends at the pub. The last one I had I only smoked of it and it tasted nasty. [SEP]', '[CLS] Cold Turkey here as well. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Smoked for years. Tried everything myself as well, including electric cigs. I'm months free and i'm a happy possum. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That's how my mum quit. Just gave up, that was about years ago. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I agree, cold turkey, but for me it took failing or times before I was able to quit. I always thought I could quit if I really wanted to, but was only after trying and failing times that I realized it had me really bad, and that I couldn't quit. That extra push of in effect being told I can't is what helped me really say FUCK u tabacco and quit for real. Don't stop trying, but go hard for the goal when you do. For the first months it really helps if you don't hang around the people you used to smoke with, that's the worst temptation of all. Just make the sacrifice, and tell them why. You'll be back but need a break from hanging out. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Welcome clear lungs, the most amazing taste buds you haven't eaten food since you started smoking I assure you , and your sense of smell. I can pick a wine in a blind taste test just by smelling it now. Once you've quit for long enough I swear you'll no longer crave a cig at all so no work resisting, and once it's been long enough still you wouldn't even be able to enjoy a puff were you to have one. Go for it people, it's awesome. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I agree. Granted, I only smoked for years but still  my roommates still both smoked so I always had the urge. For the first week or so, I had to ween myself off  I would bum a cig or two a day until I didn't want need them anymore. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Nowadays, I socially smoke. I have a couple good friends that smoke and when they visit, I'll light up one with them for their sake, but I never have the urge to buy smokes anymore. 'Tis a great feeling. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I did the same thing. Started smoking when I was , quit at . Smoked packs a day for most of this period. Decided to stop when I got the flu and went day without smoking. Cold turkey, almost a year ago. Man, the first week is bad, I don't think I slept for more than hours and would think about smoking every minutes. But it goes away, you end up spacing out how much you think about lighting a cigarette. Now I only think about it once or twice a month, usually when I see someone smoking and really enjoying it. Pro tip is occupy yourself and understand that smoking has a lot to do with anxiety. It's a way of pretending to do something, of filling your time with an activity, be it waiting for the bus or after a nice meal. If you enjoy the actual moment, if you pay attention to yourself and your body, the ways your brain will try to trick you into smoking, all those things, you'll manage to stop. It's funny though, your brain will create the most absurd reasoning for you to have one cigarette hey man, society ain't the boss of you, why live your life to be healthy, why not enjoy this nice moment with friends by gifting yourself a fine king sized Lucky Strike you'll get those moments. But it's useful to learn how much our brain rationalizes stupid choices and it will teach you to pay attention to it in other moments. When slacking off, when making general bad decisions, when you're being an asshole  Most of all, quitting cigarettes involves learning about impulse control and self control, that's why cold turkey is good, because the reward is instant gratification for not smoking. You can count the days, the weeks and the months and know you're winning Best of luck to whoever is trying to quit and remember just because you smoked one cigarette while drunk on a Saturday night, it's no reason to buy a pack on Monday morning. [SEP]\", '[CLS] There is no question about it. Cold turkey is the way to go. All the different shit you can get to help you quit, is all made by companies out looking for money.

The reason I finally quit was the price was getting too high. [SEP]\", '[CLS] That is spot the fuck on. years for me after going CT as my new years resolution. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That's pretty much what I had to do. Granted, I also had to stay away from anything associated with smoking. Bars Nope. Coffee Nope. Friends especially those that smoke Nope. Just a lot of time spent feeling shitty, lots of naps, and lots of general crankiness. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Cold turkey is the only way to go. If you need a crutch to quit smoking your head is not really where it needs to be to successfully quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] What finally did it for me was the cost. Chicago had just raised taxes again on cigarettes so they cost pack. A year habit was a bit much so I just said fuck it and quit. If I wavered in my resolve I just thought about the money. [SEP]', '[CLS] In the end it was not all that hard. I mean sure, I would jones for a smoke still do on occasion but I never flipped out over it and that is after years of smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] That worked for me. But, I also did a few push ups or squats every time I got a craving. It sped my heart rate up just like smoking did, and stopped the urge. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I tried many times to quit and then woke up one morning and hacked up something gross. Threw away what was left if the pack I had and didn't touch a cigarette for a few years.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] At the time that I quit I was smoking packs a day Kent Golden Light Menthol 's OMG I loved them so much , and there was no patch, no e cig, no pills. We had the gum and hypnosis, and cold turkey. I chose the latter.

I know . TEN dollars. That was a huge amount of money for me then.

[SEP]\", '[CLS] I did not have to my name to flush down the toilet that way. It made a huge impression on me. As a result I could never bring myself to go purchase a new pack, I just kept remembering, I flushed a carton of cigarettes straight down the toilet Quitting sucks, but I never smoked again. It was years this past December. [SEP]', '[CLS] I still have my favorite enameled cigarette case. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I quit cold turkey, and I'm . years clean. People don't understand that you have to confront the habit to quit, and you don't really do that with replacement therapy.

However, the one day he did pick to stop was April st, so if he ever did smoke again, it would be the one of the greatest and possibly saddest April Fool's jokes ever. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] As I've heard, The secret to quitting is to just quit seems to work. Well, for people who aren't me. Then again, I don't want to quit besides the money aspect. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I got downvoted to hell for saying this the other day but, fuck gum, patches, and eCigs they are all just ways to string you along until your next relapse. To truely quit you need to remove the psychological addiction as well as the physical addiction. The physical addiction can actually be overcome in the first few days but the psychological addiction can last for months or years. After years of smoking a pack a day and dozens of failed attempts at quitting I finally figured it out. Its going to sound stupid but if you read a book called The easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr and you finish the book you will quit smoking. He basically talks you out of it. Put out my last butt over a year ago and havent touched any nicotine in any form since. Im more than happy to answer any questions for anyone who is struggling. Drop that shit and be free. [SEP]', \"[CLS] How long was it until you stopped wanting cigarettes My concern is I'll just be craving cigarettes for the rest of my life. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Pretty much this. I wouldn't say that I completely quit in that I still light up every once in a while when I'm out at the bars on the weekend, but I quit smoking daily by simply not buying more. Saying fuck it and not making them available is probably the best way. Oh you're stuck at work and want to smoke but you don't have any GREAT. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I agree. I quit though have had a few I can count them on one hand slip ups at social gatherings where I've drank more than I should have over a year ago. The only thing that I did to actively NOT smoke was play Persona Golden on my Vita during my breaks at work instead of go outside. I work in a place where a lot of my coworkers smoke, and it was a real problem for me to really be near them on breaks, so I got digital friends to replace them. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'm kidding about replacing them, but this worked for me, and I couldn't be happier about it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I quit cold turkey almost a year ago, and i hardly get cravings any more. The first three month were a circle of hell, but after that the cravings just dropped off for the most part. Also, being actually held accountable for it helped me too. My SO told me that if I wanted to continue smoking, he wouldn't like it, but he wouldn't be up my ass about it either. However, if I chose to quit he would hold me to it. I slipped up a couple times at the beginning and some of the worst fights of our relationship ensued. It sucked, but it worked. There were actual, immediate consequences if I smoked, so it ended up being easier to not smoke and not have to deal with the confession and inevitable fight.

Some are easier to avoid than others, but again, you have to make that decision that this is the life you want to live. Best of luck to you and anyone else who's in the struggle.

I was heading towards packs a day. [SEP]', '[CLS] E cigarettes were the only thing that did it for me. I still had cravings, but when I was on the e cig the cravings seemed to lack a certain amount of their normal urgency. Like, I could recognize the craving for what it was, evaluate it, and dismiss it, rather than feeling obligated to give in. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That worked for you Thats awesome, maybe all my friends are just addicts. They all went for e cigs, sat on that for a while and now they just smoke a mixture of both I really don't get it sometimes. NO benefit for them whatsoever.

I thought my comment sounded bitchy after I thought about it, but after the overwhelming response, I'd like to tell everybody that you've all done a Super job. Even if you haven't fully quit, taking the step, even if you step back, is very important. Over time, you learn you don't NEED cigarettes. You WANT them. And ultimately you have to decide which you want more. To smoke, or not to smoke. That is the question. [SEP]\", '[CLS] You know that reddit meme YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE. [SEP]', '[CLS] Think of that when you get a craving. [SEP]', \"[CLS] It's been years, I'll be in my th in February. You have to understand that life is gonna keep sucking even if you're not smoking.

[SEP]', '[CLS] He literally went No more and quit smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] Me too I just woke up one morning, and was like, this is it. No more. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Rather frustrating, because I quit in March right after my first ever real winter in Toronto having lived in Australia before then . I'd spend the whole winter miserable having to go outside in the snow to smoke, dreaming of Patio season and being able to enjoy a beer and a smoke on a patio somewhere, just sounded amazing. Then right before it was warm enough to do any of that, bam I decide I can quit Pain in the ass. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Cold turkey I also substituted it with a different habit. For me it was MMA training. And eating. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That's how I did it. I was hoping this would be the top answer. You really must WANT to quit. Friends of mine have quit for their SO, because of the cost, because of the health issues, all of which have failed because deep down they didn't want to, they enjoyed smoking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is really the best answer. You aren't going to quit unless you decide you are actually going to quit. It's not going to happen if you're just like ehhh I might as well quit today. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I quit cold turkey two years ago cause I didn't enjoy it anymore, it wasn't worth how it was making me feel and would affect my health in the future, and it was damn expensive smoking a pack a day. I made up my mind I was done with it for good and I haven't had one since. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This, for sure. In my experience, the gum, patches, and whatnot didn't help at all. I had to really want to quit. When I was finally ready, I gave it up and just chewed regular gum for awhile when the cravings hit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Not looking for a magic cure use your willpower, then you only have yourself to blame when it doesn't work and you feel crappy every time you smoke after you fail the first time and you eventually quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That really is the only way. I had tried to quit several times, but I remember one day I just decoded it was over. It's been over a year now. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Exactly. Just because some people have a lack of will power doesnt mean all of us do. Cold turkey never works , nope works perfectly fine if you're strong enough to control yourself. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I decided to quit, but it still tok a few years of trying on and off before i did quit. The thing that finally worked was when i realized that my desire to smoke was based on lies that advertisements had put in my head. All the advertisements make you think that cigarettes are refreshing and relaxing, but for me, I actually felt kind of shitty and anxious after i smoked a cigarette. After that, quitting was easy because whenever i got the urge to smoke, i understood that the only way i was going to feel refreshed and relaxed was to stay quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I'm in the process of moving plus I was sick and out of work for three weeks recently. Cigarettes are . a pack here in MA, so it was a necessity to stop as I have no extra income to spend on a habit that's going to kill me in the end. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It's only been a week but I haven't really noticed the switch from cigarettes to my e cigs I have one of the refillable vaporizers. My sister had the same one and tapered off of it after a month. She hasn't smoked in months now. I am finding that I prefer 'smoking' my e cigarette as there's no smell and I have an unlimited amount of flavor options. My favorite so far is a strawberry watermelon pineapple blend. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I've been smoking for years, Marlboro Smooth s, a pack a day. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Another great motivational tool So far I've saved   monthly I'll save that means I can feasibly afford a brand new car if I were to continue to stay off cigarettes. Between my boyfriend and I we both are quitting that's that's a luxury vehicle payment every month. Or a vacation. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Good luck to you OP. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same for me. I added patches in to help with cravings, but in the end it was the ultimate determination to quit that did it for me. [SEP]', '[CLS] When i was younger my dad quit like that mainly because i was developing severe asthma related issues because of his smoking. So one day he just woke up coughing and hacking his lungs out and said to himself i cant do this anymore. Then in the morning he got up and saw me hacking and coughing as well and set up a breathing treatment for me and took one look at his pack of cigarettes and just threw it in the trash never to be seen again. He said it was tough on him to just stop like that but every day he woke up with a craving or anything he knew how worth it it was going to be for him and his family once it was over. [SEP]', '[CLS] This is the answer. I quit so many times, it was only when I was entirely fed up with smoking, and entirely fed up with quitting that I stopped cold turkey and just went on with my life. Also dill flavored potato chips got me thru the first week. Whatever it takes, just get thru the tough part. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same. I was tired of smelling bad and wasting my money on a pack. I started smoking American Spirits and they were so strong that they made my stomach hurt. It stopped being fun after that. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The only answer Beyond that though, I'd add two things. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] First smoke your last cigarette at night as usual before bed. Make sure it's the last in the pack and there aren't more in the home. Tomorrow you wake up and they aren't available. DO NOT buy more avoiding the whole trip to the store for more is waaaay easier than staring at that cigarette and trying not to smoke it . Some people like to carry around the unopened pack, and that may be fine. But I acknowledged my addiction and had to deny myself access. No available cigarette will go unsmoked. I'd typically smoke em down to the filter, so no butts for me. But these May need to be purged prior to the final night first day. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Second have a reason to stay 'quit ' Develop an activity in which Lung capacity is a benefit. There are plenty of times I 'get the urge' but enjoy being able to breathe even more. Having something stronger than the urge to smoke to hold on to when you're dying for that puff. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Eventually you'll come across someone that stinks to high hell and you'll know the process is nearing its conclusion. For me this was the moment it all got easy. I really didn't want anything to do with them after the stinky guy, though the urge does come occasionally. And I know I can never have one. One puff would lead to one cigarette. One cigarette to one pack. And I'd be hooked again. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Yeah, I decided I wanted to quit, because I was going to attend a no smoking campus. Just wasn't worth it to stink up my car or my clothes to satisfy a silly impulse. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Thisssss. You have to actually WANT to do it not just quit because you know you should. You have to legitimately want to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] No offense but this is a really unhelpful answer. [SEP]', '[CLS] This is also what worked for me. For about a year before I stopped I hate the taste, it pissed me off so much that I had to keep using this thing that I just hated more and more each day. My father was in the hospital and they used a patch on him. He was in there for several weeks and doing just find. So I decided to get a patch and try it out. I only ever used that one patch and then nothing. never craved one and was so damn happy to be rid of that. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I found that with smoking as with every important change I have made in my life this was the turning point. You're an adult. You're not going to do something you want to do if it's readily available and already part of your lifestyle. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I went from a pack and a half a day to smoke free on July , . I regret nothing. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Same here. I decided I didn't want to be a smoker. I used nicotine patches to help me quit, and kept my mouth busy with sunflower seeds and beef jerky, but the thing that made it happen was that I had decided without a doubt that I wasn't going to be a smoker anymore. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Patches and smoking joints when I got the urge. After a few weeks you have that stench off you and you can breathe. It's hard to see the trees through the forest, but once you're a little outside of it you'll be able to understand why there's such a negative stigma around cigs. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This. It also helped to have a wife who also decided it was time to quit, and we fed off of each other's guilt. [SEP]\", '[CLS] My grandpa did that years ago when he was , started when he was. [SEP]', '[CLS] Came here to say this. Tried a few times, never took. One day I decided I wanted to quit. I FELT the need to quit. One year later smoke free. There are no gimmicks, just you. [SEP]', '[CLS] Same here. Pretty much straight will power. I just decided that I hated it and that it was a silly thing to do. The slightly tough part was convincing myself. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Yup. Two years here. You really have to want to quit more than you want a cigarette every time. It gets easier the more time that has lapsed because you don't want to throw it away for one crappy little smoke. And no cheating Each puff makes it easier for the next one. If you are sneaking smokes, then you aren't ready yet. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Exactly. I tried to quit twice, but finally I got to the point where I just didn't want to smoke. Obviously there were physical cravings, but I didn't want a cigarette anymore. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] You're ruining the possibility of advertising products the OP could buy, that's not how deceptive marketing works. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I tried ecigs and it didnt work. Ive tried numerous attempts at quitting and I could never do it. I wanted to quit so bad and for the longest time too, but I wasnt ready. [SEP]', '[CLS] I think your mind and body have to be ready to quit altogether. I woke up one morning and decided i didnt want to die and just quit cold turkey. Its been weeks now and it feels great. U have nothing to lose and everything to gain by quitting. Keep at it and goodluck to ya. [SEP]', '[CLS] Edit As cliche as it sounds, chewing gum really helps. It just helps satisfy the oral fixation. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This. It could be because I wasn't that addicted, but on three occasions I've just quit like that. There's been a good month to year gap where I haven't smoked, and then just picked up smoking. But each time I just quit and never picked it up again. Odd. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Funny how it seems the best cure for addiction is willpower. [SEP]', \"[CLS] There is no easy way. Quitting was probably the hardest thing I've done and I've passed three bar exams and ran a marathon . Just decide to do it and do it. No excuses. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I haven't smoked in over a year quit cold turkey. I relied on exercise cardio , less drinking and seeing less of my smoking friends and a naggy wife. Also, I will put what I used to spend on smokes in a jar that I call my Cool shit jar. I just bought a drum set of CL with the money, which I use to rock out. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Also, don't use eciggies. Those are stupid looking. And will likely kill you. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I think above all else, this is how people quit. They may accredit it to other things they were doing picking up a hobby, exercising, chewing gum ect , but i really think it comes down to genuinely wanting to quit. The same goes for every other addiction out there. [SEP]', '[CLS] PS  addiction is not a disease, people. You cant choose to stop having a disease. [SEP]', '[CLS] This I quit smoking after being a smoker for several years. I have to admit, that I kind of got sick of smoking and really wanted to stop. [SEP]', '[CLS] Wife got pregnant, I quit with her. years ago. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Same here, I quit tobacco and cannabis this way. It sucked, but was totally worth it  days clean and I'm not looking back. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Yes It doesn't matter what you do to make the transition easier, as long as you have set in your mind that you are quitting. I quit using patches just to keep the edge off and to keep my marriage in tact. I've been quit for over years and still crave them though. I still watch people smoke and in my mind they are having the best fuckin' time in the world paling around with their best friend Marlboro. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Sometimes it helps to get pushed into taking the decision. I really liked smoking, until I got asthma. Was easy to decide it wasn't worth it at that point a bit late though. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Truth. I had to quit for a few months for a medical condition. I didn't want to, but I also didn't want to fuck up the rest of my adult life because i was too weak willed to handle months of no smoking. The day I got the go ahead from my doctor, I bought a pack of delicious cigarettes. They tasted kind of bad, but I didn't care I was back on it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I did quit. Successfully. But I didn't want to stop smoking and until you want to actually stop smoking, you have zero motive to not go out and buy another pack. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Yep. Every part of you must be in agreement that you want to quit. Any part of you that still wants or enjoys smoking or rebels against having to quit will cause you to fail. [SEP]', '[CLS] My girlfriend tells an awesome story about when her great grandfather deciding to stop smoking. He smoked a pipe and while laying brick one day, when he stood up from grabbing some mortar, he hit his pipe on the wall, it jammed his mouth painfully. He essentially just got pissed and said, Fuck this shit. and put it into the wall he was working on. Just decided to Cask of Amontillado it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This is exactly how I plan on doing it. I know that once I really WANT to quit, I'll be able to. I experienced the same thing when I became a vegetarian years ago. I decided I didn't want to eat meat anymore to be more healthy and I gave up meat easily in a day for years. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is what my dad did. I've heard him say a few times, if someone really wants to quit, they will just quit. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Not me but a friend of mine was on jury duty and they were all talking about quitting. One guy who was a pack per day smoker said, Oh I just used the tequila method. everyone just looked at him confused. [SEP]', '[CLS] He continues, You know how people have that one night with Tequila where it was so bad and they got so sick that even the smell of tequila is too much for them to handle Well I thought about that and thought that I could apply it to cigarettes. [SEP]', '[CLS] So I went to the store, bought packs of cigarettes, went home, and then JUST ATE ALL OF THEM . I got so sick that I basically did nothing but throw up for the next days. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I've gotten nauseous at the smell of cigarettes ever since. [SEP]\", '[CLS] same here. always wanted to quit after graduating undergrad, and stopped the night I got my diploma. something changed when I decided that cigarettes smell bad and not appealing. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I like to think that every stop smoking campaign is a big conspiracy led by tobacco companies. By constantly advertizing that it is incredibly hard to stop smoking and that you can't do it without nicotine patches or gum, they actually discourage people to do so. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The only thing you need is motivation, it's as simple as that. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Same. Smoked for years. Tried to quit a couple times. Always failed because deep down I did not want to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] You have to actually think about it and really want to quit in order to do it. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This is the one thing people don't realize when they quit. Unless you really want to stop, you're not going to. You'll find some justification for one last smoke. Maybe it's a bad day at work, an argument with family, hell maybe someone just cut you off in traffic. If you want to smoke, you'll smoke, and that's true until you find a reason not to. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] You can tell a smoker times it's bad for them and they need to stop, but they'll brush it off every time. When they tell themselves that, that's when we try to quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That being said, I've been using an e cig with decreasing nicotine for the last month. It's not quitting completely, but it's a step in the right direction. Seems to help. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This is what my dad says. He quit because it was his choice and he made it. He quit cigarettes, drinking, meth and has been clean over ten years now. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That's what I did too. One day I just ran out if cigarettes and never went and got another pack. Haven't smoked since. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Same. I did use the patch for half the time it's meant. I bought one box of each dose just to make me not a total cunt for that time period. years later I sometimes use a hookah at a restaurant. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This. When you really decide to quit, you will. If you ever feel the urge to go back, just buy a vape instead. [SEP]', '[CLS] I forced myself to believe that the tobacco plant had gone extinct. When I saw people smoking I felt bad for them because they must have been smoking tea leaves or something out of desperation. It made it easy to get through those first few days and after that it was easy to keep it up. [SEP]', '[CLS] Exactly. Take the decision for good and stay with it. No I have to or I would like to quit , just I quit and be done with it. I stopped years ago. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I picked up smoking at i'm now , my dad smoked dead now, not because of that bust still dead i picked it up from my friends  now i smoke or a day  i'm gradualy getting them down, i have days i don't smoke, so i hope i'l get them down to none. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I decided I wanted to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This is it. The only way that works. I would add more detail, though. Pills, patches, gum, etc, don't do it. You have to decide to hate it rather than love it. You have to be mindful, every time you feel the urge, to make yourself think of all the things you don't like about it. In my case it was my twice per year sinus infections and constant lung cookies that I decided I hated more than I liked the relaxation, the work breaks, etc. I tried the patch twice, and failed. When I decided, mindfully, that I wanted to quit, I stopped cold turkey and I haven't looked back. years and counting now, after a year pack a day habit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Same for me. Its been a couple weeks now and its been pretty good. Only time i get a craving now is if I've been drinking. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is exactly what happened with me. My girlfriend had asked me to quit, I tried once, it lasted about months then I went back to smoking. Then last year January rd, I just said  I think I'm done smoking. It's tough sometimes because I moved to a small town and fucking everyone smokes here, but no cigarettes for me for a year now. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That's what worked for me as well. I had tried several times to quit before but I would always just tell myself I can't smoke or I shouldn't smoke. It wasn't until I reached the conclusion that I didn't want to smoke anymore that I was actually successful. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Truthfully it never fully goes away. Seeing people smoke, I sometimes miss the act itself especially as a way to waste time, driving, appetite suppressor, etc. but smelling cigarette smoke, or the breath clothes of a smoker remind why I'm glad I stopped. It's been almost years now. How time flies. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Same for me. Played soccer for years, smoked about of them. Stopped from one day to another. Feels so good to freely breathe. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I finished my pack and thought I'm not going to buy another . That was about weeks ago now and I'm just fine. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Such simple words, yet so hard to grasp for people desperate to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I think that a lot of people try to ween themselves off of smoking. For it to work, you actually have to want to quit . You have to commit to it. When you decide to quit, that means you CANNOT HAVE ANOTHER CIGARETTE EVER AGAIN. Ever. For good. Not even one. You have to make that commitment and really want it and believe it. Anything less and you're lying to yourself. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That's how my grandpa quit. Guy smoked for years, then decided he wanted to quit because his dentist of all people mentioned something about it staining his teeth. After years. He just quit cold turkey then. Admittedly he was smoking ultra lights, which is pretty much like inhaling air through a nicotine filter. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I went the same way. During my life i tried to quit several times, but it never worked out, because in my head, i actually did not want to quit. When i finally decided that i actually want to quit, it was quite easy to just stop cold turkey. [SEP]', \"[CLS] That's what did it for me. But I'd qualify that I wanted to quit, and I actually meant it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] You really need to want to do it. Not just say you do. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Same here, I just decided it was time to quit, no major life events happened, nothing hit me hard or anything like that, I just stopped and that was that. I always feel a little bad saying that when people ask because it's probably not helpful when they're looking for insight or motivation, but it's the simple truth. One day I ran out of cigarettes and I just decided I wasn't going to buy any more, and I didn't, I just stopped. Now, I have an e cigarette handy for when I really get the urge for a smoke but I only used it once or twice a week. I think when it finally runs out I'm just not going to buy another, same as the cigarettes. I've been cigarette free since Labor day of last year and e cigarette free since New Years day of this year. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] See I would upvote but the problem is, you chose to smoke one day before that. and that's always a downvote. so it cancels out just enough so that i don't downvote you right now. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Same here. One day I just decided it wasn't worth paying a company for a slow and painful death. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is honestly the only way. Seriously, there is a huge difference between quitting because you have to or something and quitting because you don't want to smoke ever again. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I also quit this way. Decides that smoking and dipping was destroying me. Substituted with walking around the office and eventually exercise and clean diet. Mind over matter. Every time if wanted a smoke I just said not this one time vice only one more. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I haven't actually quit quit, but I have cut down dramatically. I realized that my nicotine tolerance was so high that I didn't really get anything out of a cigarette other than a cough, so I decided to only smoke occasionally for the experience flavor. Now I have small cigars cigarillos a week, which I typically don't inhale at all. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] same here. I had cigarettes left in my pack. I told my buddy wanna share my last cigarettes for you, for me I didn't even finish each one half way. Haven't touched one since. Zero cravings. That was almost . years ago. [SEP]\", '[CLS] There are millions of smokers who have Decided to quit dozens of times. Everyone who fails at quitting at one point decided to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Me too. After years I went from one day smoking to nothing every again. It just gets better every day. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I decided that yesterday. I felt like 'I don't NEED to smoke, I can quit any time' so yeah, when I finished the pack yesterday, why not now Let's see how it goes. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This is what I did, too. Smoked from to years of age. One day decided this is filthy, ashes everywhere, bad breath, and is bad for me. Never have had a smoke after making that decision to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] yeah if your trying to quit smoking, alcohol, drugs, anything for that matter its never gonna happen unless your trying to quit because YOU want too, not because everyone else wants you too. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I did pretty much the same thing. Had a weekend in Amsterdam and slightly overdid it, then decided that come Monday I'll quit because I wanted feel better healthier. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I bought hr nicotine patches that Monday but by Wednesday thought that I really hadn't felt like smoking, and I I didn't think it was the patches that helped. Cut the patches, felt the same and haven't had one since. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I think you'll quit when you really feel like the time is right  Hopefully that happens for you sooner rather later. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Self control is the only way. But you have to realize that your brain is an asshole, and will bombard you with bullshit reasons to make an exception. Had a real bad day Life going to shit You deserve a smoke, you've earned one, a reward for all the shit you put up with. Or you need it to calm yourself, or whatever justification right down to fuck this I don't care anymore I'm just too overwhelmed to give a fuck your brain will be right there to stab you in the back at your first sign of weakness. So it took me plenty of tries, but finally it stuck. First tries were pretty much just being a moocher, bumming smokes and not buying my own as though physically having them in my pocket were the problem. Then only bumming them on breaks once in a while. Once you reach the point that its only every few weeks or even months it really sinks in how much you stink from having one and that helps. The grossness might take years to overcome the 'one every few months' thing but eventually you are a true non smoker with no desire left. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I've been using ecigs for a bit now. I started off with the equivalent nicotine mg's as what I was smoking a day. Once I run out of the vape juice I go in for a new bottle and decrease the nicotine level by two. I'm now almost completely independent of nicotine. I've had a few cigs here and there and I can honestly say I prefer the taste of the vape over the cigs now. Be strong and good luck. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is exactly how my husband quit. Ecigs were more than just an aid to quit smoking, they became a major hobby for him. Along with cutting the nicotine back over time it was a really great way to occupy his mind. He was always tinkering with them, buying some new part and going to local vape shops. It kept him excited about his ecig so excited he got a few friends to quit smoking and start vaping with him and distracted from cigarettes. We are about to celebrate the anniversary of his first year without buying a pack. I'm super proud of him. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I started vaping and that broke the social habit of going outside with people since I could do it just about anywhere. After that, I sort of forgot about it. I mean, I'd vape when i felt like it, but I felt like it less and less. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I've been nicotine free for a month. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I wasn't even planning on quitting. I really thought I would smoke for the rest of my life. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] tried the ecig to humor my husband and now I haven't had a cigarette in over months. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Same here, started vaping at mg, I'm down to right now. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It's so damn easy to quit with ecigs. It just tastes so much better then smoking, but you still get the nicotine. So many different flavours to choose from, and so many different ecigs to get. This was not just a way to quit smoking for me, it's my new hobby. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This. I was a year smoker. I had tried the gums and patches. Then I tried the e cig and it worked. I haven't had a cig in eight months. The key for me with the e cig route was finding a juice that I really liked. Once I get a hold of Bounty Hunter by NLV I never looked back. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Chewed tobacco and smoked for about years and quit in day using ecigs. [SEP]', '[CLS] Over year clean now without ANY issues. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Can you or anyone else recommend an e cigg that doesn't weigh the earth Every single one I've tried is just, soheavy  Falls out of your hand. A cigarette should not fall out of your hand. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] If I could find one that's light, maybe this shit might actually work. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Haven't had a cig in months and haven't had an e cig or nicotine in about or months. They worked for me Started at mg and worked down to mg nic over or so months. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is almost exactly what I did. I started with an mg bottle, then when that was done, I went to mg, then mg, and finally, mg. After a while, I stopped carrying the ecig with me because I found I almost never used them. It's been almost a year ecig free and a year and a half since I had an analog . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I figured I'd find a post about e cigs in here  And yep, that's how I quit. I was almost smoking Canadian packs of cigarettes a day after years of smoking. I've been doing e cigs exclusively for the last years. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The e cigs have their ups and downs, after all they're not as simple as just lighting a rolled up bunch of plant matter on fire, but I feel a whole lot healthier and I look like a time travelling bounty hunter from the future. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is the only thing that came keep me away from real cigarettes for months at a time. That is to say, I can enjoy e cigs while I'm drinking or when I'm with other smokers and not be tempted. Those types of situations will otherwise get me every time if I'm just cold turkey. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Using a brass atomo clone with a Russian right now. Good on you for quitting. Been about a year since I quit myself. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I started smoking at , started quitting at . Quit many times for durations up to years. Went years after using gum and first generation e cigs for months. A little over years ago I gave e cigs another serious try. Had one cigarette on day , didn't enjoy it or finish it. I'm pretty confident I will never use tobacco again. [SEP]\", '[CLS] My impression is that e cigs are half quitting , there were some cravings and withdrawal symptoms, but now I can go hours without using, and like so many others, have reduced the nicotine levels considerably. I introduced a friend to e cigarettes and he quit everything after a year, apparently with little difficulty. [SEP]', '[CLS] This I was a heavy inhaler of packs a day, currently smoke about puffs a cig in morning have not yet today and puffs or so in evening, everything else is vaping now. [SEP]', '[CLS] Kanger EVOD is a pretty good device, but I will probably get one I can up the voltage on to get a bigger throat hit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My wife used the Nicotrol inhaler you suck through a nicotine filter , and it uses gradually lower doses. After a while, she wasn't even using a cartridge, just needed the felling of the 'cig' in her hands. It's been . years, and she still gets cravings sometimes, but hasn't smoked since. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Yup I got an electronic and quit smoking tobacco literally over night. That's from smoking about cigarettes every day for about six years. Speed up eight months, and I still had a pack of cigarettes with two left in it from that day, hadn't bought one since, and I just threw it out. Now it's been about a year and a half since I had a cigarette. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Ecigs are also great if you're often in situations where you're tempted to smoke. Instead of bumming a cig at the bar and going down the usual spiral to smoking again, you can smoke your ecig, not be miserable around other smokers, and not be very tempted to smoke. [SEP]\", '[CLS] What people are failing to specify here is that the ecigs which are piddly lookalikes at Walmart and the local Quick E Mart are nothing short of terrible. [SEP]', \"[CLS] If you're going to try the ecig as a means to quitting, I recommend buying something refillable and ugly. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Its ugly, yes but the vapor produced will be closer to a hookah smoke than a cigarette. After only a few days the transition becomes very easy. The cigarettes flavor pales in comparison to a good juice, you notice immediately that your clothes do not reek of cigarette and you seem to have more money. [SEP]', '[CLS] The choice of ecig is truly the most important part in the beginning. I like kanger, ego and itaste brands for batteries and I highly recommend the kanger pro tank mini as a bottom load cartridge. To make it more durable, pick up a kanger T s tank and use the plastic tank on the larger base for improved airflow. [SEP]', '[CLS] As far as liquid, the pompeach, razzleberry and sweet tart flavors from smokeevapor.com are hands down the best I have tried. I have many friends who have switched to ecigs and they all seem to love any variation or combination of those flavors. [SEP]', '[CLS] Ecigs can be complex and frustrating but once you have made that switch for a few weeks the taste hassle of cigarettes is just no longer appealing. [SEP]', '[CLS] I am sorry for formatting spelling, I am typing on my potato. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Yeah, I've managed to quit cigs after a few tries by switching to ecigs. A huge part of it, though, is you have to really want to quit. So much so that this desire is much greater than your cravings. I think otherwise it doesn't work that well. What helps me is realizing smoking is a very unattractive habit and girls are usually turned off by it it's certainly not an attractive look for girls either. Furthermore, it is kind of a masculine thing . I also visualize the smoke, tar, carcinogens, entering my body and irreparably damaging my body and building up gross, smelly, phlegm in my lungs and making my already yellow teeth even more stained. I try to remember the times that smoking actually felt gross even as a smoker usually when I felt satiated but kept smoking because I felt a need to finish the cigarette . Lastly, being the stingy guy I am, I remember that I've invested in this ecig rig and I would feel stupid if I resorted back to smoking. I hope this helps, good luck. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I also used an e cig to help cut down on that craving. I didn't regulate as much as you did with the nicotine, only used light dosage filters. I also cut down on drinking because the first thing I would always want a drink or two in would immediately be a cigarette. Between that and immediately after eating were the two hardest habitual times to not be smoking. However, this March ill be years cigarette free. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Best thing about ecigs is they are so much cheaper than normals. The juice where I buy it is bucks a bottle and lasts about weeks for me. Replacement coils are dollars for and they last about weeks as well each, so that's dollars a week which is about the price of a single pack of cigs which lasted days on my old habit. Really wonderful way to step down the nicotine while not really sacrificing anything. Super helpful when going out drinking as well. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I quit using ecigs a couple of years ago. I didn't even have any real desire to quit. I just decided to try one, then when I ran out of juice I decided not to buy anymore. Virtually no will power was required. I found it real easy, which was a huge shock, because I was perfectly happy being a smoker, to be quite honest. Nice to be smoke free, and to have more money in the bank, though. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] E cigarettes worked immediately for me. I got my first starter kit in th mail on feb , and I've had less than cigarettes since. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It wasn't hard. I had one or two cravings in the first couple days and then it was clear sailing. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] They have become a hobby, I love vaping even if i end up saving less money than I could have. I really don't understand why anyone smokes anymore with how awesome vaping can be. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Started vaping at down to . Gonna hit next time I get more. Then it'll just be breaking the puffing on something habit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Yup. Electronic cigarettes are definitely the way to go, especially if other methods have failed. It's been completely painless, and after a year of not smoking, my body is in such better condition. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Pack every days for about . years, for of those over PAD. Tomorrow I'm hitting months with no slip ups thanks to r electronic cigarette. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I think it's important to realize that there's going to be times where you're still craving a cigarette, and that it's not a total cop out switching to vaping. Nothing is going to replace the  experience   of smoking a cig, but it can help lower your nicotine dependence as well as get the tobacco chemicals sans nicotine out of your lungs. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I smoked years. I was a chain smoker. Got my first ecig little over years ago and instantly stopped smoking. Also went for minimum nicotine. I'm guessing I'm more hooked on the habit. I have not had a single cig after I quit and have no desire to either. On the other hand I have no intention of stopping vaping. My protank is just arriving in the mail atm. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I did exactly this and when I got to the lowest nicotine level they sell mg I started buying mg fluid and blending it with the mg and continuing to dilute it until I was at about . mg of nicotine. Then I just sort of stopped using it. I was decreasing the dose over the course of about years, cutting it down every few months or so. After about a year of using the ecig, I couldn't even handle analog cigarettes they just were gross to me and I vastly preferred the ecig. I haven't had an analog cigarette in like years now. I still have the ecig and mg fluid so if I'm going to be drinking anywhere that a lot of people are smoking then I can just bring it with me but I very rarely even do that anymore. [SEP]\", '[CLS] As somebody who successfully quit with an e cig, the most difficult drop off is when you stop using the e cig even if you have been using juice without any nicotine . The fixation is just as powerful as the nicotine addiction. For me, it helped to be able to tackle them separately, but do be prepared for that. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I'm still having trouble figuring out the dosage of ecig to what I would smoke in cigarettes. I feel like if I dont know the equivalent dose I'm just gonna keep ripping down vapor till I turn into a mummy. Any suggestions on figuring out doses. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Me hat is the health risk of using an e cig The harm of the smoke is taken out, so what exactly is left. [SEP]', \"[CLS] But now I'm vaping. I want to quit all habits. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Did unread somewhere that those are linked to stomach cancer. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The only downside, is you should look at an e cig as an e pipe. Keep it clean, and you will enjoy it. You can get a lot more usage out of an e cig cleaning with high alcohol a trick I learned from a GGG vape shop owner . Don't vape everywhere though, because people seem to get pissy about it. You can explain all you like, but they will get pissy. It may not be your thing, just keep trying. Patches, gum, hypnosis, e cigs, try them all, find your way to quit. Good luck. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Same here. I've been using ecigs for a little over a year. I've tried a couple cigarettes since, and I truly can't stand them. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] A good start would be an eGo Twist and an Kanger EVOD or T . I upgraded to a Sigelei Zmax v , and use the same clearomizers, and I've been very happy with that setup.

No looking back I haven't smoked a single cigarette in almost . years. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Now I can breathe. I can run. I can ride bikes with my son. I can smell OMG, forgotten smells were overwhelming especially cigarettes, not judging . . . . And taste. Food smells wonderful. [SEP]', '[CLS] Vaping WORKS. And Boomer lives. [SEP]', '[CLS] careful with those ecigs, they can contain way more nicotine and get you even more addicted. [SEP]', '[CLS] I get voted down everytime I say this, but it is worth mentioning I know a lot of people who have quit using E cigs, but no one who has quit their nicotine addiction. My friends who use E cigs almost all still smoke the occasional cigarette. They use their E cigs all the time and if they go without them for a few days, they will generally smoke cigarettes in the mean time. [SEP]', \"[CLS] When I used the patch, the gum, the lozenges, etc in the past, I was still imbibing nicotine, and when I didn't have it the cravings returned at their normal rate results may vary . [SEP]\", '[CLS] So please take note OP and anyone who wants to get off nicotine, while E cigs are probably better in some regards, you may find yourself trading one way to satisfy an addiction for another. [SEP]', \"[CLS] E cigs  they got you man. Still paying for nicotine. And when you're running the mg juice, you'll be paying them for water vapor. Just quit.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] At the end of the book, his final words of advice are to never smoke a cigarette ever again. I knew this advice was true, but I wanted to test my will power. After quitting for months, I tried to see if I could be a social smoker again, but I just picked it right back up and became a regular smoker again. I knew I'd still eventually quit because this book equipped me with the mindset needed to quit. Months later when I felt it was time to quit again, I decided I'd quit forever and did so. I haven't smoked for more than two years now and never plan on going back. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] E cigarettes don't even attract me. [SEP]\", '[CLS] yep. this book is the best.

Alan Carr's book has some great mental excersizes that help with the overall process of quitting. His book helped me to not only quit but to help me think properly when a craving to light up again hit. [SEP]\", '[CLS] That was how I did it. Carr flipped a switch in my head. [SEP]', \"[CLS] When I started having a nic fit, that was not my body saying I want a cigarette. My body was saying I don't want to want cigarettes anymore.

Twenty year habit, two hour course, not smoked since. That was years ago. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Carr's book made me quit for weeks years ago.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] One of the highest voted comments suggests quitting cold turkey, if you really want to stop you can, but I think this book is useful for the people that don't think they want to stop. I think the biggest problem for most people is they don't actually want to stop, they just think they ought to stop. What the book does is explain that you actually want to stop, even though you think you don't. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I also found this book powerful. Mind you, I failed several more times before I succeeded after reading it but it put the role of cigarettes in my life into perspective. Cigarettes aren't good or calming instead, the absence of them is upsetting. I found the idea of being nicotine's bitch unpleasant and unforgettable. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'll be years in May from that book. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This. I had to read the book twice though. The first time I read it, I KNEW that it was the answer, but I wasn't quite ready yet and a year later I was smoking again. When I was really, REALLY ready, I got another copy of the book if you like printed books, get it used for less than on Amazon , I took the book and a pack of cigs and sat in my truck and read almost the whole thing in about hours. When I was done, I was gratefully, thankfully, painlessly done with cigarettes. I have not had a single puff in at least years. [SEP]\", '[CLS] As someone else said, if you want to quit, and you read the whole book, you can quit without pain.

But go to a seminar instead of the book if you can. hours which you smoke through and you walk away simply never craving one again. As a smoker, that never made sense till I went. You still go throug minor withdrawals, but they are a cakewalk and short lived compared to the other ways I tried. [SEP]', '[CLS] How could I buy this for my SO without it seeming horrible.

I was a year pack a day smoker and none of my friends thought I could ever quit. got the book a day after a failed attempt at quitting and I really quit about halfway through reading it it actually encourages you keep smoking if you still are and to quit when and if you have come to the decision yourself I did finish the book and proceeded to give a copy to about friends mine who were also smokers. Happy to say of the six are still now non smokers. the th has worse drug problems. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The funny thing about reading all of the above posts is how everyone who talks about how great and important will power is in quitting also always mentions how they still miss smoking. Look at the people who quit by understanding that they never needed what Alan Carr's book shows you and they never mention or complain about missing smoking. I can honestly tell you that I don't miss it or even really think about it at all after. It was somewhat hard for the first month but now smoking is just something that I realize I started because I was a dumb teenager and stopped because I realized I actually did not need to smoke in order to have fun, go drinking, deal with stress or any of the other things smokers condition themselves into believing that they need cigarettes for.

I love this now dead man. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Yep This book in combination with a hypnotherapy session worked for me It's been years. [SEP]\", '[CLS] My brother recommended this to me, because it helped him quit smoking. I found that while I was reading the book, the desire to smoke did go down a little, and cigarettes started tasting and smelling funny as I went along. So, I thought that was neat. But I still lit up after I was done. This has however helped me in regards to where I am now, looking at cigarettes the same way I did when I read the book.

The non smoking me understands that the only way to deal with stress is to find the real cause for it and do something about that reason. Smokers tend to give cigarettes more value than they actually have. Mostly it is the ritual, the smoking break, having something to do with your hands, going outside for mins that helps, not the ciggie.

By three and a half weeks I was about to go out and smoke, then decided not to. That was almost years ago. I still think about smoking. When I'm out drinking at the bars and all my friends go out for a smoke, I miss it a little. But my asthma is non existent now. I only need the inhalers, which I have used constantly since about years old, maybe twice a month. Also I promised myself that if I live until , I can start up again assuming they are still legal .

She also wanted to quit because she was worried about second hand smoke and SIDS with our baby. She is going on years now. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I did it with a combination of Chantix and Wellbutrin.

It seems like when chantix is tolerated, it works really, really well. I think the longest I ever saw someone on it was or months. None relapsed as far as I heard. That said, it seems many people can't tolerate it. I usually suggested to those people to try ecigs. Ecigs cut out all the crap of a real cig and you can ease your nicotine levels down while still satisfying the physical addiction of holding that cancer stick. They also have a better cessation rate than patches or gum. Plus they have cool flavors you can play with. I have friends who had no intention to quit who got into ecigs because of that stuff. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Seriously, Chantix is a miracle drug. After taking it for a week, quitting smoking was actually really easy. I only had one day of physical withdrawal symptoms. I took it for a month and have been a nonsmoker for years now. I'm betting the tobacco industry is very thankful for all of the bad publicity this drug got. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Chantix did it for me too. Everyone on this thread who quit cold turkey definitely has my respect, but I tried that and just about everything else and just couldn't stop without eventually starting up again. Chantix basically ruined cigarettes for me for good, which is just what I needed. it has been a year since I stopped taking it and to this day the idea of smoking a cigarette makes me cringe. A lot of people have mentioned the side effects I didn't experience any of that and know that every person is different. As with any prescription drug you should be careful and closely monitor your physical mental emotional state for any changes while you are taking it. That said, for me Chantix worked wonders and there was no down side at all. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Chantix worked for me. I picked it up on a recommendation from a pharmacist with no real commitment to quit. days later my desire to smoke was completely gone and I had been a pack a day smoker for years . Side effects included vivid dreams cool, but very disruptive to sleep , and intense road rage. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Wellbutrin Bupropion for me. Prescribed for other reasons but suddenly I realized I didn't need nicotine anymore. After that it was simply a matter of not buying another pack to break the habit.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] I was reading some message boards reviews of the drug, and one guy said it makes you forget what it was like to smoke . I agree with this. I see smokers now and it feels like I've never smoked at all. My brain doesn't even remember what it felt like to drag on a cigarette. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The only issue I have now is sometimes I dream that I smoked a cigarette. The dreams are really vivid. It's kind of disturbing to wake up and think I didn't actually quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Side effects are pretty bad, it's better to quit using another tool IMO. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I was successful on Chantix for a few months with the bizarre dreams, and started again when my wife started again she used the patch .

The dose stops the cravings and does not produce the side effects like the full dose did for me. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I'm a biomedical science grad student and grew up hanging out working in pharmacies. Chantix is awesome on a whole. I sold a ton of it. Now, it gives some people side effects and, for some people, it doesn't work at all.

If somebody is having real problems quitting and hasn't tried chantix, I would highly recommend asking their doctor for it and be aware of the side effects. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Worked for me as well. Worst side effect for me was the lucid dreams, and i cant claim them to be a negative. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I'm on week of Chantix right now. The dreams are sooo fucking intense. They aren't bad, just intense. I would take pills just for the dreams. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Chantix did the trick for me, too, however I was unable to complete the full month course of medication due to the side effects. [SEP]', '[CLS] About weeks in, I started becoming uncharacteristically angry and aggressive. After narrowly avoiding a bar fight which I started and kicking the shit out of my kitchen trash can for some reason or another, I decided it would be wise to stop taking the stuff.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] Pretty much the same for me. I decided I was tired of going to the doc every month coughing up blood. I took Chantix for three weeks and by the end of the first week I wasn't smoking a single one. By the end of the second week, I didn't even enjoy the smell of a nearby cigarette. After three weeks I just stopped taking the pills and moved on with my life. I still have cravings from time to time Quit . years ago. especially if I have a few beers, but I just have to remind myself that it isn't worth it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Same, Chantix. After several failures using a variety of other methods including cold turkey , it was surprisingly easy to quit with Chantix. I also never took a pill right before bed so I pretty much missed out on the intense dreams. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I took Welbutrin. I kept smoking for the first week, and I kid you not after that week, cigarettes tasted disgusting and every time I smoked one I didn't know why I was doing it. My brain wasn't getting the nicotine so I was smoking without the pleasurable feeling I was used to.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] Chantix is the only thing that worked for me. It took awhile, a few attempts while on and off of it  but it worked. getting off the chantix is it's own weirdness, but not hard just weird. It's difficult to describe in vivid details, but with Chantix I slept awesome, had great dreams, and felt generally swell. but when I quit, my sleep got more restless waking up occasionally, having a little bit more trouble falling asleep , and sometimes when waking I would a bit off, like something was wrong. That abated after a few months though.

As I recall, research suggests that gum, patches, etc. all feed the craving, and the most successful quitters were those who went cold turkey. I could probably find a source for that if necessary.

I followed there system and it worked. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Basically it let me focus on the habit and not the addiction. Once the habit part was dealt with the going from mg hours none was very easy.

Hypothetical fears based on different sources of nicotine which smokers do not enjoy taking aren't a counter argument. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Glad that worked for him.

[SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit in after smoking for years. What did it for me was a huge price increase. Like . a pack. I got so pissed off that I was paying so much money to essentially kill myself that I was able to quit cold turkey. [SEP]', '[CLS] Quit in . By then a pack in Sweden was dollars.

[SEP]', '[CLS] I was very skeptical but I thought anything was worth a try to get me through so when my first came in the mail I tried it out, what can I say except it worked and I pretty much gave up smoking right away and I still have an unopened packet. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Don't think I could go back to smoking again and it sickens me to see the campaigns against e cigs now I think they have lengthened my life and it's downright evil to try and remove them from a society that still has tobacco. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] it sickens me to see the campaigns against e cigs   it's downright evil to try and remove them from a society  . [SEP]\", '[CLS] I fully agree. When I feel a wave of anger coming over me, I just enjoy the delicious irony that e cigs have put anti smoking extremists in bed with Big Tobacco. [SEP]', '[CLS] I need an e cig. [SEP]', '[CLS] throw the unopened packet away. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Alan Carr's easy way to quit smoking. Great book, read it once and have been quit for years. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Easy way to stop smoking by Allan Carr. I quit twice using this book and so did all my friends. Highly recommend it to any smoker. [SEP]', \"[CLS] It worked for my wife and I. I'm not sure how, but it took the stress out of it completely. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit smoking about million times before I was successful that makes me an expert, right My personal research focused on former smokers with at least a year of non smoking under their belts led me to the solid conclusion that cold turkey is the method that almost all successful non smokers use or so if I remember my stats correctly . Do your own research, define what you think of as success in those searches. [SEP]', '[CLS] Here are some things that I went through to help me wrapped up as advice. [SEP]', '[CLS] First, get comfortable with the idea of being a non smoker. Spend some time imagining what it will be like to stop smoking. Daydream about it. Practice turning down cigarettes in your mind. Let it be what you think about in the shower and as you drift to sleep at night. If you meditate meditate on breathing better, being able to run, having white teeth, being morally superior to your smoking friends, or whatever about being a non smoker is attractive to you. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Then commit to being a non smoker . Decide that you're going to become that daydream that you're having. That doesn't mean throwing down your pack and trying to see if your will or the drug is stronger. It means knowing balls to bones that this is what you're going to do. [SEP]\", '[CLS] During this time start cutting out some places that you smoke . For me I stopped smoking in my car. Then I stopped smoking inside while at home. Then I stopped smoking at work. This was all a process that I went through for months. [SEP]', '[CLS] Decide on a date. Think of it as your new birthday. On your new birthday get rid of all your smoking stuff. Give it away, throw it away, burn it if that means something to you. that means lighters, ash Trays, cigarettes. [SEP]', '[CLS] Avoid places where you went to smoke. That means changes in your life awhile. Plan months or a year. Smoking areas are off limits to you just like bars are off limits to an alcoholic. [SEP]', \"[CLS] When you have those moments where you think you'll have to cave pray if you're inclined, take a timeout, go to your car and scream for a minute, take a jog, code, eat celery, pick your nose do something, anything besides smoke. The craving will pass. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Repeat the daydream in your head, often. The withdrawal is only temporary. It's like having a bad case of the flu It will suck, but you'll get over it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Stay done. Realize that you can't argue with addiction . There is no reasonable amount of smoking. There isn't a peaceable middle ground between smoking and not. Stick to it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] If you slip up, so what Throw that pack away too. Go back to the daydream of being a non smoker. One slip isn't failure each time you've quit before has prepared you for this. Put your quitting shoes back on. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Look at the benefits of quitting. Look them up, read about them, think about them, cherish them. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I doubt you'll get this given the thousands of responses, but maybe it will help someone. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Edit words did and didn't happen. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Quitting smoking is easy I did it times last year. [SEP]', '[CLS] I worked as smoking cessation counselor back in the day. Some things to keep in mind. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Most people attempt to quit times before being successful defined as at least months without smoking. Having failed at quitting several times is actually good it means you're on the right track of working out when and how to quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] there's two aspects to smoking behavioral and physical. You can treat the physical with nicotine gum, patches, or gradually reducing your smoke intake before a quit day. Behavioral also requires strategy find some thing you can do when you want to smoke. Whenever and however you can change your habits is a big help. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] in the end, it all comes down to gutting it out. There are some tips and tricks that make it a little easier, but it's guts. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Am I right in saying that even if you're ingesting nicotine, say with gum or patches, for those months, you're still considered successful I think that's the only reason studies show that nicotine replacements work. [SEP]\", '[CLS] How would one find a smoking cessation counselor. [SEP]', '[CLS] After reading Allen carrs book and quitting easily without having to try and fail again and use patches or other nicotine replacements, I think these methods are vastly inferior to his. Why make it hard on yourself. The physical part is almost non existent. Its all in our heads. [SEP]', '[CLS] Which is exactly why vaping is so successful, since it replaces the behavioral aspect while also providing the physical aspect. [SEP]', \"[CLS] It isn't just nicotine addiction that comes along with smoking, it's habits. Routines. I would have a cigarette before class, during breaks, and after class. I'd have a cigarette after a big meal, with my morning coffee, etc. Start breaking these habits. I would first stop smoking when I was going to from class. Then gradually break more of these habits as you go along. I also started running to aid in the inevitable weight gain it's also gratifying when you can run for a half hour straight without dying from the lack of breath. I hope this helps I honestly never thought I'd be able to quit and it's been over six months now. You can do it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] These kinds of actions helped me quit the last time. For me if was no more smoking in the car, and then no smoking until all of my work was done. This lead me to realize I viewed smoking as a reward. That's like rewarding yourself by having someone rub your face in asbestos. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is exactly what I did. Some people aren't able to go this route, but I found that slowly cutting out each smoking habit helped me immensely. I started by not smoking in my car, then not smoking at lunch, and eventually progressed to only smoking cigarette a day. Running helps too It feels great to progress and be able to breathe while working out. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Also, MAOIs present in tobacco enhance nicotine addiction, too. So, that also comes with smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Did you ever end up gaining weight since you decided to run to combat it This is one of the things I'm worried about. But I do love running. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I just passed my th day without a cigarette http wwwsigbanners com reddit .png . I couldn't have done it without vaping. Electronic cigarettes, when given enough power and enough nicotine if it looks like a cigarette, it's probably too weak on both counts give you a better 'smoke' than tobacco does, and actually smoking would be a step down on all counts. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Complete change of environment and habits. I quit my job. I doing so I had the chance to change my entire daily schedule. With no habitual smoking breaks, I dropped it without a problem. It was really just the habit, not the addiction for me. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I smoked for about or years and tried cold turkey or limiting myself to only smoking at home and not work. My sister in laws dad was a lifetime smoker and developed lung cancer at the age of and slowly died within two months. She sent me a picture of him in the hospital a week after the diagnosis and that was enough for me. It wasn't the typical YOUR LUNGS WILL BE BLACK AND FALL APART IF YOU SMOKE bit rather a real world example that hit very close to home. This was a man that I viewed as a strong leader and now he was barely over pounds and couldn't even lift his head on his own. I stopped cold turkey that night and haven't looked back. I have a brother who still smokes and at his rate he won't live to see , which means he only has years left with us. I would never want to force my views on anyone and understand that people can do what they want but I would strongly recommend that anyone reading this comment please stop smoking. If not for yourself than at least for your family and friends. [SEP]\", '[CLS] We have age guys in our office. One skiid, still goes to the gym and was active and never smoked his entire life. The other has been smoking since he was a teen. The non smoker is as active as a year old. [SEP]', '[CLS] Listening to the smoker cough up his lungs every minutes is terrible. It is like my uncles last days alive when he came to live with us lung cancer . My headphones brely drown it out. [SEP]', '[CLS] Were all gonna be old someday, which old person would u rather be That and also waking up in the morning with headaches, scratchy throat, and black boogers made me stop. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I know what I'm gonna name my band. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Honestly, the idea of dying younger doesn't bother me. It's the idea of having an awful quality of life, maybe having a leg amputated or a lung removed, for years before I die that bothers me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] When my desire to smoke a cigarette was less than driving out in the middle of a tropical storm to get another pack. Then I realized how much I didn't want a cigarette after the storm cleared. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I heard an interview with a medical researcher who had just released a paper claiming that if you stop smoking at then your prospects of a long life are not significantly changed by the fact that you once smoked. I was at the time and I realised that I had a chance to turn things around, and do it now before it was too late as I was already beyond the mark . [SEP]', '[CLS] And then a few months later I met my wife to be who was totally anti smoking. If I had smoked that day when we first met yes, it was a real Hollywood like love at first sight moment she would not have paid me any attention. This removed any risk at all of me reverting to my smoking ways. Yes, I struggled with the want to smoke, but I had found something soooo much better, a woman that loved me and a prospect of a long life. Simples. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I just quit for the second time, and I'm excited to share my story. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Saturday will be the week anniversary of the last time I had cigarette smoke in my lungs, I did it easily with e cigs. [SEP]', \"[CLS] January , my wife picks me up at work as usual we are currently sharing one car and she begins to tell me about her day, including that she had filled the gas tank. I quickly look around for my cigarettes because she usually picks them up for me when she fuels up. She sees me looking around and asks Aren't you going to go get one of those e cigs you were talking about. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] D'oh I had mentioned the idea of trying one in passing earlier in the week and didn't realize she would have taken the comment to heart. Reluctantly, I gave in. Yeah, I guess . [SEP]\", '[CLS] So we drive to Vaporz, the nearest vape shop in town. I knew I wanted a PV personal vaporizer over a typical e cig that you could buy at every convenience store in town, simply because of the success failure rate of both that I have personally seen from friends, acquaintances, and co workers that have tried quitting using an electronic substitute. [SEP]', '[CLS] At the shop, I was greeted by an exuberant hipster type guy who seemed way too chipper for the attempt at a major life change I was about to make. After explaining my situation to him, he presented me with this starter kit. [SEP]', '[CLS] http iimgur com FW izn.jpg [SEP]', \"[CLS] He then asked me how much I smoked. Admittedly, it wasn't much comparatively to some people  about pack a day. He suggested medium strength fluid mg Nicotine per ml and asked what flavor I would like to go with my starter kit. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Determined to not set myself up for failure, I asked for the Marlboro flavored fluid. [SEP]', '[CLS] When I got home that evening, I had a smoke before I went inside then proceeded to examine my new gadgets. I filled the tanks on the PVs as he had instructed, attached the batteries, and started puffing. Not too bad. I thought to myself, and continued to use it the remainder of the evening. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The next morning was the real test. Major trigger for me is just getting out of bed in the morning. Nicotine starved, running out to the porch the first thing in the morning to get my fix has been part of my daily ritual for over a decade. Still determined not to fail, and subsequently losing my previous night's investment about , I fired up the PV and started sucking on it like  well, like something that sucks a lot. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I still had about cigs left in my pack of American Spirits, so I slid one out, stepped outside, and lit up. [SEP]', '[CLS] There it was, the rush . The feeling you get when you light that first cig up in the morning, the rush to the head, the burn in the throat, the satisfaction that you and your body just craves . [SEP]', '[CLS] I butt it out and go inside to a disappointed wife. I explain to her that there are different nicotine levels in the fluids they sell at the vape shop and that I wanted to return for stronger juice. She agreed, more eager than I am for me to quit smoking and quit stinking like smoke, ash, and tobacco. [SEP]', '[CLS] The happy hipster is there again, and I explain my dilemma. The nicotine level is too low. Also the Marlboro flavor has that weird, sweet aftertaste which is what steered me to American Spirits in the first place. After a short discussion about the strength of the cigs I smoke vs. the amount I smoke, I leave the shop with three new bottles of juice. Two bottles of Camel tobacco flavor and one bottle of cinnamon, all in mg strength. [SEP]', \"[CLS] At home I empty out and reload my PVs, one with Camel and the other with cinnamon. I tried the cinnamon one first, it hit my throat like a truck. It actually felt like smoking. The Camel tasted more like the cigs I'm used to then the old juice did, and didn't have quite as harsh of a throat hit . [SEP]\", '[CLS] My solution I mixed the two. The end result tastes like Hot Tamale candy flavored cig, which is great since I love cinnamon. However, I knew the real test would be the next morning. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The next day, sitting at my computer, I fire up the PV for the most part, it's odorless so my wife approves my use indoors . The drags are satisfying but didn't quite get as much of that rush as I had hoped. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Again, I slip out one of the remaining cigs I have, step outside, and light up. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I'm discouraged and disgusted at this point. I know I won't be able to keep it up. I know I'll regress into smoking full time. I keep puffing on the cig, waiting to the rush I know will come. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I realize as I'm standing on the porch, looking at my half smoked cig, that I took my morning hits at my computer  sitting down . Usually, my first smoke will make me dizzy, sometimes to the point of stumbling when I try to walk back inside. Only after I sit for a bit and when my body is used to having the nicotine flowing around usually just a minute or two do I become stable again. I know sitting with my PV greatly reduced that initial dizziness that I normally get when I'm standing on the porch. I take my half smoked cig and snuff it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Wife is sitting inside, wondering if I wasted more money buying the stronger juice. She is ecstatic as I grab the remaining cigs I have and crush them into the garbage can. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I haven't smoked since, and I'm confident that I can vape without wanting to go back to cigarettes indefinitely. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I also want to add that since I've started vaping, I've done some research into the matter and here are some key points that I've learned. [SEP]\", '[CLS] . Nicotine is not a carcinogen. The other chemicals in cigarette smoke is what causes lung cancer, not the nicotine. As a stimulant, nicotine in doses in the amount a regular PV delivers, is roughly the same risk as caffeine. [SEP]', '[CLS] . Secondhand vapor from a PV has the nicotine levels of secondhand cigarette smoke, th the particulate matter, and negligible trace amounts of anything else. [SEP]', '[CLS] . Vapor dissipates much faster than smoke and is virtually odorless. I noticed an improvement of my ability to smell and taste after about days of vaping. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Additionally, I talked my dad into trying vaping. I told him to go to a reputable brick and mortar B M vape shop and talk to a salesperson so he can see and maybe even try different options. I think it's better than trying to go it alone via mail order. He switched back and forth between cigs and vaping for a several days then quit cigs entirely. He is about weeks cigarette free as of today, from a to pack a day smoker. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Hopefully, my story can be helpful and inspiring to you or someone else who reads this. This is why I took the time to write it all out. [SEP]', '[CLS] Edit I also wanted to add that I opted for the starter kit with PVs because I knew if I had downtime waiting for a battery to charge I would be climbing the walls before it was ready to be used again. [SEP]', '[CLS] TL DR Not all e cigs are created equal. A good vape shop and some common sense decision making can find a satisfying alternative to smoking. [SEP]', '[CLS] Replying so I can find this again tomorrow. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Willpower. I had yet another month where I had still some month left at the end of my money and I said to myself That's it. I quit. I'm so done with this shit. Never touched a cig again, now months off them. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Having a heart attack at age . I had two packs on me and gave them to the EMTs. It helped to have a week off of work too. I couldn't function for a few days with the withdrawal. [SEP]\", '[CLS] How did you know you were having one What brought it on. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I'd imagine you would need to be either predisposed or lead a very inactive lifestyle to bring that on, but it is good you quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I started smoking at age and stopped smoking at age . I am years old and haven't had one in years. I got to a point where I knew in my mind that smoking was going to one day kill me quicker then I wanted to die. You gotta just want to quit, period. It really is mind over matter and once you get over that hump there's no going back. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Stop trying to quit if you really don't want to quit. If you DO want to quit, stop being a pussy and do it and I mean that in a good way. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Getting pregnant This obviously is also an expensive habit though. I quit cold turkey after smoking for years and never touched them again. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Preach years ago I quit. I still crave on occasion now, but getting hooked again isn't worth buying a whole pack. Besides long life to be around my kid is worth it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] And while I was pregnant, I couldn't stand the smell or sight. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Chantix is amazing and effective. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Cold Turkey. I just remember standing outside thinking God, this hurts. My lungs literally hurt right now. and put it out. Never looked back. I didn't go out for awhile Almost all of my friends smoked at the time. I just shut myself in for like a month and felt exponentially better every day. Now, even second hand smoke gives me an asthma attack. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I started a streak of days not smoking and held it in such high regard that I couldn't imagine going back to . My buddy read a book, The Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Alan Carr. He quit and buys about of the book every year to give out to anyone who mentions to him theyre trying to quit. My buddy is a good dude. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Eventually, you're going to find that the most effective way to quit is to just stop. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I never tried or bothered to pick a date for my quit. Part of me knew that I had to stop soon before any of the major health effects started taking place. I was already getting bronchitis virtually every time I'd catch a cold so that was kind of a warning sign  Then one morning, I woke up and said to myself, Fuck it. Today is just as a good a day as any. I suppose that helped with any kind of anticipation towards a quit date. Some people like to try to reduce first. Frankly, I think that just starts the pain early before it even takes full force. Here. Let me just stab you in the legs a little bit before I cut them off with this rusty saw. I've always had something of an all or nothing mentality. If you're going to quit, don't bullshit yourself. Just stop. To anyone who is was one to two pack a day smoker, you know well this concept seems easier said than done. Dig deep. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I think the worse part of quitting was the concept of quitting more so than just the cravings themselves. Before, my mind would calm down a bit knowing Hey. Just an hour or two and then you can get a smoke in to relax a bit. The realization would set in You're never going to be able to smoke again. At that moment, my mind would start to freak out. After a few weeks of this, I was beginning to wonder if I was going to end up living out the rest of my life in a constant frustrated agony of good and bad days. Shouldn't this have subsided by now The cravings don't feel like they've become lesser or weaker at all. Nothing has fuckign changed How is this better All I think about is when next time I'll ever be able to grab a fucking smoke again. If this was my fucking option, maybe I was just better off smoking. Whoever said that the withdrawal only lasts three days needs to be beaten into a bloody pulp. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Those first three weeks were probably the shittiest three weeks of my life going through chemical and psychological withdrawals. For me, I felt high as hell those first two days. It wasn't a good high either. I'm guessing that was my body relearning how to release glucose on its own again without help. Stinger energy gels became a staple in my diet. I would have made Wilford Brimley cry. After that, it became the psychological craving battle. Frankly, it was hard to distinguish between chemical cravings and psychological ones. The chemical ones were more intense, but the psychological ones were more frequent. Any kind of stimulant only made the cravings more intense. Monster energy drinks became a big no no. I'm on Concerta for ADHD, and HOLY FUCK did those ever multiply the cravings. Looking back now, I probably should have taken a vacation from those as well. They likely made my withdrawal substantially worse than what most people will ever experience. If you're on Concerta or Ritalin and you smoke, you probably have some idea of what I'm talking about. Methylphenidate can usually does turbocharge any addictive tendencies you may have. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] You want to know when you realize you actually are an addict When you're trying to quit and you see half of a lit cigarette on the ground that someone tossed away in the street, and picking it up for a few hauls seems like a decent and reasonable idea. It's odd too because you never really feel the moment when you're free. It could take a few days realistically a few weeks or possibly a few months. Everyone has a different clock. Then magically, one day you're going to wake up and realize Wow  I haven't had a nicotine craving in over a week. This eventually becomes, I don't remember the last time I had a craving. For a while, the only thing memorable was the infuriating madness of craving just one more burn. Hell, just a drag. One drag won't hurt, right Yea. Lets fuck up three weeks of torture and start all over again. Seems like a fan fucking tastic idea. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Freedom is a great thing. It's not a quick thing, but it does eventually come. That was always my biggest fear. You begin to notice that you're capable of feeling lucid and focused without getting a quick burn in to help you out before hand. Think of it like getting better from being sick. There's no sudden AH HA moment. It's a progression. Think back to when you were at your most miserable from something like a hangover or food poisoning. Now think about how you feel at this very moment. When you're feeling that awful, you want nothing more than to just feel NOT miserable. If you're not feeling sick and awful right now, you've won. You've achieved what you wanted some time ago. Take a moment to cherish that feeling. The concept is the same, only now you're directly responsible for the outcome. It's funny too, because victory requires the absence of doing anything. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I've always considered it a decent test of willpower and character. After almost two years, I still look back feeling like I conquered Everest.

This was such a true and inspiring response, and I sincerely thank you for sharing. I'm proud of your accomplishment and I wish you further success I'm days cigarette free with only a few cheats. Which actually weren't even that great, honestly. Thank you again so, so much for your kindness in sharing such wisdom. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That was incredibly generous and helpful advice.

I thought e cigs didn't work for me too until I visited the subreddit and realized my biggest problem was being too cheap about it. You'll never switch fully to e cigs with those crappy chinese cigarettes. I've quit lots of times, nicotine patches and toothpicks worked for me for a while but this switch has been the easiest time quitting ever. I am a pack a day smoker, I spent of my week smoking budget on a good e cig itaste ep and found a good juice mix and now I've never been happier.

It also helped that i got a mix with an odor, learned the sensation of smelling something with the puff helped. I have the light odor of blueberries whenever I take an e cig puff. . You gotta want to reprogram yourself to not smoke. the first few days will break you when you realize how much better you feel on e cigs and how much more time you have with e cig taking the time to get you the same amount of nicotine as a single smoke.

It took a couple weeks, but it worked like a charm. It didn't take long before I was just tired of being high all the time. That was years ago, and while I've slipped a few times, I've never smoked more than one here or there. I still occasionally get cravings but they pass pretty quickly mostly because I'm out of the habit of smoking. Like you said, being in the health care industry, your breaks only happen if you smoke. It's the same in the food service industry. It was a habit I developed and I had to get out of the habit of taking smoke breaks. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Finally I was wondering how long it would take to find this answer. I thought I was a freak. [SEP]', \"[CLS] OK, I am kinda freakish, but I'm not alone. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] So let's say you wanted to smoke a cigarette while stoned, you'd just take more puffs. [SEP]\", '[CLS] That sounds crazy harsh.

It made the effects of smoking negligible to me. I'd smoke but I didn't get a rush. Nothing at all. I went through withdrawals. I freaked out at work, yelling at a coworker. I was almost sent home for the day. I remember the withdrawals peaking on the third night. I was in a fetal position screaming into the carpet in my living room. Once I hit that hurdle, I kept on with the Welbutrin, but only for a couple weeks because I was warned that Welbutrin itself is addictive. Note that many people will tell you that Welbutrin is a bad drug, but I think they may be confusing its side effects with nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Also, Welbutrin gets a lot of bad press from people who are using it to treat their mental illness, and I don't trust their feedback. So yeah, welbutrin did it for me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Something to note is that once you do quit, you'll still want to smoke. Like all the time, at first. But if you can sit back and observe the addiction the urge for what it is and not act on it, you'll do fine. Next, note that you'll need to readjust your life. Like what do you do right after a meal now that you quit What do you do when you're just standing around outdoors We had no smartphones when I quit What I'm getting at is that you'll feel oddly uncomfortable with cigarette's absence, but you'll adjust. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] One last point. Not smoking makes you more attractive. Also, my wife tells me that when I smoked, I smelled not just like smoke, which is gross unto itself, but I also smelled like shit. I can confirm that smokers actually do smell like smoke and shit.

Then from that day on, every time I saw someone smoking or smelled smoke, I would tell myself how gross it was. Soon I started believing my lie and now I find smoking completely disgusting.

I started taking my breaks together and going for short runs at work and just sponge bathing myself upon return. So when the inevitable day came around and my one smoke turned into two packs the shortness of breath came back with a vengeance.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] The best way to stop is to do things you usually don't do. Take walks, go jogging, drive somewhere if you never smoked in your car , go swimming, work out. Eat and drink a lot. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That's basically all there is to it. It's really important that you plan this and take your time off from things for the first few days. If you try to go about your usual daily business but just without smoking you will most likely fail. Remember, smoking is a habit. You are always smoking in the same situations, like waiting for the bus, having lunch break at work, etc. so you need as many new situations as possible for the transition. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Edit I smoked for years, two packs a day for the last few years, and quit that way. [SEP]', '[CLS] I smoked for years. At the height of my addiction, I was smoking two packs a day. I tried quitting times before I was finally successful and it was Nicoderm patches that finally got me through. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Quitting is problematic in two ways first you have the actual physical addiction. It's a pain in the ass. For me, trying to quit cold turkey without a nicotine supplement raised my anxiety levels and would ultimately lead to ridiculous justifications for smoking just one cigarette. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The second problem is the mental addiction. For me and everyone I know who has quit , this is by FAR the hardest aspect of quitting smoking. When you smoke as much as I did, cigarettes are part of your life. They aren't a thing that you do to relax or for fun the social smoker excuse , they are a habit so integrally wound into your life that you will have one hell of a hard time breaking it. I had a few triggers that I learned to identify through my failed attempts at quitting smoking. I wanted a cigarette right after every meal. I never found a good solution to this one, although the wave of public smoking bans helped keep me from smoking after meals at restaurants. I like to join other smokers outside for smoke breaks. If you've never been a smoker or if you're just not socially awkward, you probably don't understand this one. But there really is something comforting about smoke break social time. This was the hardest. I liked to smoke when I used my computer. Whether it be gaming or other activities I would chain smoke when I was at my computer. When I finally quit smoking, I shut my computer down, thoroughly cleaned my computer desk of all ashes and ash trays, and then covered it with a sheet. I didn't touch my computer for three weeks after that because I knew if I did, that mental addiction would kick in and make me more likely to relapse. There were other triggers too, those are just the highlights. What you have to do is find ways to break your habits and squash those triggers. It will mean that you have to change other aspects of your life besides just giving up cigarettes. If you really want to quit though, you'll do it. It's worth it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I grew up in the south on a tobacco farm. Smoking is a tradition in my family so is lung cancer . Over the last decade I have watched of my surviving family try to quit smoking cold turkey with no assistance patches, counselling, etc Every single one of them has failed. Some of them have failed numerous times. The same can be said for most of my friends who have tried to quit cold turkey without assistance. In fact, I can remember only one friend who was successful, but he had only smoked about a half a pack a day for a year. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My best advice for you is to seek some type of assistance. For me, the patches helped tremendously. They almost completely staved off the physical addiction. I was able to work on breaking the habit the mental addiction without the added anxiety of the physical addiction. If you decide to go with patches, be sure you follow the step down plan completely. Don't tell yourself that you can rush through it to save money. Spend a little extra now and save yourself some money in healthcare costs later. Step down gradually and give yourself time to adjust. Also, you may not want to wear the patches at night. They gave me fucked up dreams and often I found myself unable to sleep well. So i took the patch off at night and applied a fresh one first thing in the morning. Lastly, I know the patches may irritate your skin a bit. They do burn a bit when you first put them on. If you can, work through it. It's worth it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I also know many people who have gone through extensive counseling and have used medication to quit. Many of them have been successful as well. In fact, if I were quitting today, I would certainly explore that avenue. Smokefree.gov lists counseling with medication as one of the most effective means of smoking cessation http smokefree.gov explore quit methods . [SEP]', \"[CLS] No matter what you decide to do, you have got to start telling yourself right now that you will quit. You don't want to quit. You WILL quit. And do not ever fool yourself into thinking that you can have just one cigarette. I don't care if you quit for weeks and decide that one smoke isn't going to kill you. Once you've been addicted, one cigarette will lead to justifications that you can have one cigarette per week. Then it will be one every other day. Then one per day. After ten years of being smoke free, I absolutely refuse to let myself have a single cigarette. I've wanted them. Even now I find myself craving them occasionally. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] So consider something to help with the physical addiction. Patches, medication, something. I'm not sure if I'd recommend e cigs because then you don't really break the habit of having a cigarette in hand. I guess they are still slightly better than filling your lungs with smoke though. It's a fucking hard battle, my friend. It's worth it though. Good luck. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Edit I wrote a bookfuck . [SEP]', '[CLS] TLDR get help via supplement or medication and counseling . Make yourself quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Getting diagnosed with colon cancer. [SEP]', '[CLS] I smoked for years and just quit one year ago. I know it is for good because I decided in my mind I was no longer a smoker. Once you decide that way, smoking a cigarette makes you feel kind of guilty instead of relaxed and calmed. [SEP]', '[CLS] It also helped me to know that cigarette cravings are temporary. They really are. You can be sweating out an intense craving, then get a phone call and totally forget about it. This is fairly unique to cigarettes. As time goes by the craving will come less and less often. After a month or so, you will notice cigarette smoke smells much different. It smells really bad. Instead of reminding you of smoking a cigarette, it will remind you of how bad cigarettes are, and how much they smell they leave in your hands, clothes, hair and breath. How impossible it is to hide that smell. I have a couple of friends that I cannot even ride in their car because the smoke smell is so bad. [SEP]', \"[CLS] During the first month, give yourself lots of stuff to do. I would go walk up to a convenience store and get a large oz Iced tea full of ice summer . Something to drink, and lots of ice to chew on afterward. Also went through a ton of gum and chewed on stuff like toothpicks, straws, and basically anything I could get my hands on. If you choose a patch or nicotine gum, I think this makes it more difficult because the withdrawal period is prolonged instead of getting over it quickly. At least in my experiences I found the gum just reminded me more of cigarettes and didn't give me enough nicotine to get the relaxation part of a cigarette. I recommend staying away from smoker friends, particularly if alcohol is involved for the first month. Throw out or give away ALL cigarettes and ashtrays. Then tell any smoker friends you have you are quitting and to try to not smoke around you all of my smoker friends were very supportive .

For the next few days when I was really jonesing, I would tell myself that I don't want a cig because I am a non smoker. I stayed inside every time people went outside to smoke.

No one would know that I'd failed, and I could tell myself that I wasn't all that serious about it in the first place. What really worked for me was creating a commitment device that would significantly raise the price of failure. Also give yourself something to do when the cravings hit they general don't last that long, but having a plan in place for how to approach them is good whether that's gum or whatever.

You cannot just up and quit, you MUST prepare for it. [SEP]', '[CLS] Telling everyone helps create an informal support group. Your friends and coworkers really do want you to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] Several people have said cold turkey is the only way to quit and that is absolutely true. You cannot ween yourself off cigarettes. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The method isn't the issue, it's how bad you actually want to quit. I'd tried before, but wasn't really into it, so eventually I'd cave. When I quit last year, it was because I was seriously done with it and told myself I wanted to smoke less than I wanted to give in to the craving. Because that's how I truly felt. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I tried the gum, but that gave me bad sores in my mouth, so after a week, I just gave up cold turkey.

When I finally open the door, she was imitating the hand to mouth motion of smoking and at that moment, I know I'm not a good role model for my daughter, also the wife complains that our daughter smells like an ashtray when she comes from work to kiss her. Listed myself to a Smoking Cessation Class and quit cold turkey before the graduation. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] If smoking in your car is something you can't get over either, I suggest talk radio. I just needed something to think about and distract me from wanting a smoke. The only problem is now I still listen to it a year later. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Discovering my wife was pregnant with our first child was what pushed me to really quit for good. I decided I did not want to be the reason he became a smoker when he grew up. I knew so many younger kids when I was in middle school and high school who smoked because their parents smoked. I would like to live long enough to see him grow into an adult as well. It sucked to quit, and every time I see a cigarette on television or see a co worker smoking it makes me want one. I avoid this by avoiding the places where I would normally smoke. If I were you I would just choose to not take a break over hurting your health with cigarettes. In the end you have to really WANT to quit. and its never going to be easy, the cravings won't go away, and you will likely have to give up some other things that were triggers for making you want to smoke. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] EDIT I also quit cold turkey. I would get rid of the electronic cigarette as it is just going to keep you buying the real ones. I had to quit using a very nice hookah that I had bought because it would kickstart my cigarette smoking not to mention it's super bad for you.

Turns out my wisdom teeth were coming out and during this time I started smoking less because of the pain. When I went to the dentist I only had enough money to take one out and I was too afraid of dry socket so I just stopped smoking. I still had the urge kind of  but to me it was like a sort of unspoken rule I made myself follow about not smoking during this time. I waited two weeks and then took out another tooth. After that I realized I had gone a month without smoking, which totally took me by surprise The final nail in the coffin happened one night when I really wanted to try smoking again and I could not stop hacking. I just couldn't smoke anymore. Now it's been weeks and I feel great I quit on accident. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Quit cold turkey. For the first couple weeks I used cinnamon sticks to fill the void of a cigarette between my fingers after meals and driving. Driving was hardest. I had no idea what to do without a cigarette.

Smoked for years, tried patches, gum, mints, nothing worked. One day I decided I'd had enough, got a prescription. How much of it was the drug and how much of it was the want to quit I can't really say, but I am coming up on years smoke free so I can't argue with that. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I quit cold turkey, aided by hallucinogens. I had an epiphany that I did not want to die of lung cancer after smoking nearly packs during the trip. That night was the last I smoked a cigarette and it's been over months. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I switched to American Spirits for a few months. They don't have the additives in them like the other cigs, so you are smoking tobacco for tobacco's sake, not because of some crazy chemical. Then after partying in New Orleans for Mardi Gras and smoking like a chimney I quit cold turkey once I got to midnight of Ash Wednesday. I'm not Catholic but I realized I had been smoking four years so I figured I would quit for at least days of Lent. When lent was over I lit up, said what the fuck am I doing, this tastes like ass and quit for the most part. Ill still smoke on special occasions like a cigar at a wedding or hookah on a friends birthday but otherwise I'm done. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] In addition to the cold turkey technique, look at all the negatives of smoking not like I'm getting cancer ,because honestly that won't affect you but things like its expensive, it's time consuming, it makes your teeth yellow. Convince yourself that the negatives outweigh any possible positives. This is how I overcome my habits. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Most people that smoke don't need convincing to know they should quit. The hardest part is giving up something that they enjoy and usually associate with social situations, such as a smoke break with work colleagues or smoking on the porch with roommates. It's a lifestyle change that few people want to give up. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I just decided I'd had enough one day and never had another one. I didn't even set a date, didn't mark a calendar, I have no idea exactly how many days, weeks or months it's been. I believe I quit in , but it could have been give or take a year. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] No patches, no programs, no hypnosis, no e cigs they weren't available . I think I tossed my last half a pack so there wasn't even a this is the last one. I just made the decision and never looked back. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The NYC smoking ban helped, though. I'll admit that. If everyone was still lighting up at the bar every time I went out with friends, it would have been harder to tell the cravings to take a hike. It's important to change ALL of your habits. Do something else with your breaks. Meditation. Light exercise. Go for a walk. Don't go stand out in the smoking area. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I've never been a smoker, but I knew a guy who had a really cool story about how he quit. He took the last cigarette out of his last pack, and put it in his wallet. He promised himself that if he ever smoked again, even if he was offered a cigarette, that one in his wallet would be the first he'd smoke. He said that let him see it in a new light, and he thought, Am I really gonna let this little cigarette beat me Hell no . He hasn't smoked in around years, and still has that cigarette in his wallet.

I have a lot of dreams about smoking and there are times when I would do anything for a cigarette but I have friends that refuse to give me one. I talk about it a lot and voice my need for one and that helps. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I decided to quit because I started dating a non smoker and I felt bad every time I had a cigarette. I think one of the biggest things was having a good reason to quit. All of my failed attempts were because I didn't have a good reason.

Whenever I want a cigarette I tell myself that I can start smoking again, feel even worse later, or just die. Smoking will eventually kill me.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] I quit for about months and started again because I was too scared of myself when I was losing my temper. I was becoming completely unhinged, and not just a week after quitting, but for or months afterwards. And it wasn't just being irritable, or being grouchy, one morning someone honked at me on my way to work and I pulled over the car and just started punching myself in the face. I was so angry at myself for being a bad driver and a useless person. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My problem is that I have the willpower to not smoke at work, with company over, at a non smokers house, etc, but if I am sitting at home having a drink and relaxing I want a smoke. I average a bit under a pack a week and I know I should quit completely. I just don't want to. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Ecigs are missing something and the gum is a joke.

I have quit cold turkey for over a year a couple times but eventually I have a drink and someone has a smoke and I say screw it. If the want of a smoke ever went away it would be easier, of course, but I have the habit so tied to alcohol that I would have to stop drinking completely to stop smoking completely. I think I am just stuck with this until something in life like having a child makes the decision for me or a miracle drug is invented that can wash away the addiction.

If you have that one, you'll soon no longer be quitting. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I still miss it. But I don't actually care about it anymore. At a certain point, the cravings become blunt and weak and it makes you feel awesome and powerful to be able to easily shrug them off. I still occasionally have dreams where I'm smoking and I'm get really pissed at myself for doing so. It's nice to wake up from those and you're still a non smoker. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Cold turkey worked for me. I made the decision a couple of weeks before my th birthday and made that my quit date. I think setting the date in the near future and preparing for it really helped me make it through those first few days. Someone else in this thread suggested that you wait at least minutes before giving in to a craving and then decide if you really want to give in. This was very helpful to me as well. Looking at pictures of young people withering away from cancer was also a powerful deterrent for me. This March will be my th anniversary cigarette free after smoking a pack a day for about years.

Things would piss me off and i would think I need a cig when actually if i just took minutes to chill i would be fine. After that I would mentally reward myself everytime i got through something irritable. So yea realizing I can be a dick and cigs are not really helping was what got me through. I smoked for years mind you. Pack a day for a few of those. Still get the occasional craving but have been going strong for years now. I also have better control over my anger now as a result.

I still smoked at first but felt that I couldn't compete, I was sucking wind and a poor sparring partner. It was the most fun that I had had competing since high school sports. I also started spending more evenings at the gym which meant more exercise and less smoking and drinking. I realized that it was just more important to better myself in martial arts than to smoke. For the first time I prioritized something before cigarettes. And if I as having a rough day thinking about cigarettes a noon class and several rounds of burpees quickly killed that feeling. Also, my trigger was alcohol. If I drank I would smoke but if I drank, I couldn't make class. I just quit it all.

If you want to do nicotine replacement go with patches and gum. The real insidiousness of smoking is the ritualistic aspect of it. So many day to day activities end up getting associated with smoking in our brains, things like waking up in the morning, or eating, or drinking coffee. I think to have any real success you have to break those patterns and an e cig is too similar to the real thing. You hold it the same, the delivery system is the same. It doesn't do anything to beak any of the established smoking patterns and if anything reinforces them. With patches and gum you can keep your nicotine levels stable enough to mitigate most cravings and you're not perpetuating the smoking rituals.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Nicotine levels are of course important too. If you buy a E Cig from a local gas station or wherever, they typically have mg per E Cig which simulates the NIC levels of someone who smokes less than a pack a day.

That way I could ween myself off the tobacco taste, as well as the nicotine. I was also able to have the vapor shop prepare the e liquid in diminishing strengths to gradually reduce my dependence there as well.

She told me how her dad died of lung cancer and would never date a smoker because she didn't want to go through that again. Understandable. She texted me and asked if I smoked. I looked at the lit cigarette in my hand decided finding out if this girl was worth it was better than slowly killing myself. I ground the half a cigarette out and texted her back to tell her I was quitting. I had my last cigarette a couple of days later. She and I then started dating and are still together.

After years of smoking, and trying to quit, one thing worked for me when I put the smokes down. Drink an absolute ton of water. It'll fullfill the craving, flush your system, and make you get up to pee every few hours as though you were going out to smoke. I drank a bottle or two an hour for a few weeks. At one point I realized I hadn't thought about smoking in a really long time and felt really great. Not only had I effectively quit, but I also cleansed my system. If you wipe out soda and crap food during these few weeks the side effects could also include weight loss by a lot , mood changes, better sleep, clearer mind, and improved memory.

[SEP]\", \"[CLS] I also was SURE that I couldn't drink without smoking at the time I was an Irish pub manager and was drinking maybe or nights a week , but after that morning I just knew I couldn't smoke anymore. I continued drinking and having a good time, but smoking just wasn't part of my life anymore. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I can easily say it was the most positive thing I have done in my life. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Re reading this makes it sound like I have an alcohol problem, but I don't. I was running a pub so it was a big part of my life, and now I rarely drink at all. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I used an ecig. Had my wife buy the liquid stuff for it and varied the amount of nicotine with eventually one having no nicotine. When I realised I couldn't tell tue difference I was able to quit. It is still hard though, even smoking the ecig I would crave a real cig. It was just easier to have holding something in your hand when easing off. Its not just the nicotine, you get stuck in the whole routine and movement of smoking. Had lots of those I dont know what to do with my hands moments. It is still tempting to smoke even after over a year and a hakf almost. Especially when around smokers though the smell does turn me off of it a bit more thsn I ever remembered. [SEP]\", '[CLS] My wife would probably divorce me if I started smoking again so that helps stay off I guess. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Having a child and realizing I don't want him to associate stale cigarette smell with daddy. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I know you already have an ecig  but that was what worked for me. Smoked the ecig for about two months and then it crapped out. So instead of buying another one. I decided that was it. Haven't smoked in . years. I get the work thing though. I work at a different job now than when I started smoking and no one here smokes. And the stress level is way lower. That made it much easier. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My daughter being born. I did it cold turkey and it was difficult but not as bad as I thought it would be. I have a really stressful job but once I got past a few months of not smoking the pain of puffing hurt more than it was worth. I still have cravings, espcially after big meals or really stressful days at work but I generally just try to think about my daughter and how I want to be around for her, her kids and her kids' kid's. [SEP]\", '[CLS] i used the patch. You have to want to do it, though. I was told at being THEN of average stature that I was heading for a heart attack, having experiencing a lot of chest pains. Pretty big motivator, there. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Winter break started, my parwnts and sister all hate smoking so I had to sneak out to smoke. With the cold weather. I just couldn't justify going out. Same thing with my girlfriend, and I couldn't buy them in Mexico no cash . By the time break was over I hadn't smoked a cig in around weeks. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Zyban. But I was taking it as Wellbutrin the antidepressant. At the time I was in group therapy and everyone smoked. Out of the blue one day literally I guess haha my friend was like c'mon we're going outside for a smoke   and I said nope, don't feel like it. Gave my pack away and never picked one up again. Lasted through sobriety relapses all kinds of stints on drugs. Just stopped Wellbutrin last year and no desire to start cigs. I've never heard a similar story but it was miraculous for me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Im a smoker of years. My last cigarette was on . I tried quitting a few times before but always seemed to relapse. This time I felt different about quitting. Those other few times I was quitting for someone else, parents hated it, girlfriend hated it. But this time I hated it. Felt like shit all the time, coughed out phlegm the size of a softball regularly. So I said fuck it I'm done. A few months prior to quitting I started to save every empty pack of smokes. And just looking at all those boxes, of them, really inspired me to stop. In short do it for you, and find something to hold on to, to remind yourself why your quitting. I wish the best for you. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My aunt quit cold turkey. She hasn't gone back in years. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'd say try Chantix but be in the mindset of truly quitting for good. You can continue smoking while taking it but you won't get any nicotine from it since it blocks it. So after a a couple weeks of not getting that fix it will drive you to just not have one completely and from there it gets easier. My boyfriend quit using Chantix and has been free for a year now Just like you he tired numerous times to quit until he friend told him about Chantix and how it helped him. Worth a try and hope it helps. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Cold Turkey and a refusal to entertain any of the bullshit excuses I'd made for my addiction. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Don't feel defeated if you break and have a drag every once in a while. Just because you did steal a drag or bum a smoke, every few weeks or whatever it may be, it doesn't mean you aren't in a lot better of a position you were in before. I will steal a drag here or there from my friends when I drink and I don't consider it cheating, because it has kept me from being a regular smoker. I also no longer crave cigarettes, and wouldn't even want to have an entire one to myself anymore. I know that cold turkey is probably the best solution, but it just may not work for everyone. A lot of my friends smoke, and a drag here or there allows me to me to still enjoy the social aspect of it. You can't get down on yourself for having a bit of one, when you normally or at least I normally would have had far too many cigs on a drinking night. With that being said, I had also made the unforced decision to stop. I have tried in the past before, and this time just felt more natural. The problem is, I have always really enjoyed smoking, and now it is something that I dont really want to be part of my life anymore. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Anyways, I wish you the best of luck. I hope you can find your solution. [SEP]', '[CLS] combination of actually wanting to quit and a MASSIVE chest infection. [SEP]', '[CLS] Negative association. I found the nastiest cigarettes I could find menthols for me and only let myself smoke those. After a few weeks smoking was no longer a pleasant experience. [SEP]', '[CLS] For straight, single men a GREAT reason that seems to work women. [SEP]', '[CLS] Monday night at the gym with all the new years people still milling about  but their numbers are dwindling   I was listening to two men talk about their New Years resolutions. One guy was already a semi regular face to the gym the smoker   the other guy was new to the gym. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Both guys talked about the changes they were making, and the smoker said that a girl he sees in the lobby of his building asked him if he stopped smoking because she always saw him out front when she went to get coffee  but he was smoking, she's not a smoker. [SEP]\", '[CLS] at this point I just jumped into the conversation with these guys, to no longer eavesdrop like a lunatic. [SEP]', \"[CLS] He told a story about how she wanted to come say hello to him, but as much as she wanted to talk to him, she never approached him outside or got in the elevator with him because he stunk like smoke. Plus she said that she wasnt sure they were compatible because he was a smoker and presumably, made a ton of other stupid choices in life too. So this guy is telling us about a girl who wanted to approach him, but because he was a smoker, and stunk  she didn't. I gathered that they are dating now, because he stopped smoking, and he said that being single for so long, and seeing that smoking gave him not a single benefit in life  but instead opened new doors  he quit. I'm straight but he's a good looking guy, and I can absolutely see how smoking would ruin his overall look. [SEP]\", '[CLS] He also mentioned that how there were many times when friends and family talked to him about smoking, and he hadnt an real excuse to quit. Instead he said that he was really juvenile in his mindset with his I can do what I want attitude that he said   came from smoking. He said he was a man with a kids rebellious attitude and he was ashamed of that. [SEP]', '[CLS] At that point, the other guy started making Cartman voices of I do what I want   and the tone of the conversation changedhaha  The biggest takeaway from all that for me was hearing an ex smoker admit to smoking at least one reason because of you cant tell me what I shouldnt do. [SEP]', \"[CLS] You get the point  I'm rambling now. [SEP]\", '[CLS] There is no try. Just decide youre done and then dont do it. Youll feel terrible for a while but at least youll live longer. Also, maybe tell a doctor and get some Wellbutrin. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I just threw it all away and just kinda stopped. I don't know how or why it worked. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit cold turkey, smoked a pack a day for six years and I started when I was stupid  . [SEP]', '[CLS] Quitting was a combination of two things. [SEP]', \"[CLS] One day at university I got a really good whiff of some people coming in from a smoke break. I thought holy shit, that's what I smell like to everyone else around me . When you're in it, you don't smell it as much. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The second thing was laws that forced me to go outside to smoke when it was in the winter cold. I got tired of that shit and decided I'd rather stay inside and not spend a week on cigs anymore and not stink or freeze. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Many days not lighthing up a smoke. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Okay, first of all, this works. I am not fucking with you at all. I used this method myself and I have not had a cigarette in over three years now. Moreover, I can still be around smokers and not be tortured by the reminder nor made sick by the smell. Honestly, it's all good. I didn't use punishments or any of the conditioning methods because I was worried about the long term effects of fucking with behavior modification. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'm serious. It's a simple technique that will get you through the hard shit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] You're going to be a dick anyway because of withdrawal. So instead of fighting it and stressing yourself out more, embrace it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] There is some nuance to this that you'll have to navigate a bit. Obviously, you can't just crank up the dickitude to eleven and start peeing on the menu outside Jack In The Box. What you can do is relieve some stress by venting to some very supportive friends who can be amused to see an uncharacteristically aggressive you. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Also, you'll need some structure to avoid going insane. Let's face it, there are some terrifying consequences going at this without a plan. You don't want to become an asshole permanently, do you. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Step One Tell your friends and co workers that you're about to be an asshole. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] This is vital. They need to know what's up and why ahead of time so they can a enjoy the show and b be supportive. It's also important to approach this step very carefully. Don't just say I'm going to quit smoking and it's going to make me a raging tool so you're all going to have to deal with me. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Example Look, I am so sorry to do this to you guys but I've decided to quit smoking. It's something I'd like for myself. I really need your help on this because I'm afraid I'm going to be short with people and rude and obnoxious for a few days until the nicotine is out of my system and I want to say I'm sorry before it even happens. I promise I'll make it up to you when it's all over. I'll get you some lunch. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] A couple points on step one. First, be sincere in your apology. Sincerity is important. Empathize with what these folks are about to go through. Put yourself in their position and imagine someone is telling you the same thing. Second promises of small presents or food have to be fulfilled later so keep track of that shit. It's necessary to the program to get out of asshole phase as quickly as possible, not to mention it's the right thing to do. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Step Two Give away your cigarettes. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Don't throw them away, give them away to a smoker It's silly to be wasteful. As soon as you've notified everybody you can think of that you're going to be a colossal fuck head for a little while, stop with the cigarettes right then and there. Don't make a big deal about the last cigarette ever. Just stop. The sooner you get this shit over with, the better. Which means the sooner you stop, the sooner it will end. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Step Three Be A Fucking Asshole. [SEP]', \"[CLS] This is going to suck. You're not going to like how withdrawal feels. You're going to want to punch a baby. And that's okay Not baby punching, don't do that, but don't punish yourself for thought crime that you can't control. You're allowed to think about the punchibility of the faces of infants. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Luckily, in Step One, you've shored up a lot of support with folks that know what you're going through, even if they're not smokers themselves. They know that it's making your uncomfortable and they know the manifestation of that discomfort. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] When you are in the company of these supportive heroes, remember to vent to them, not at them. That is to say, complain about whatever tiny things happen to be pushing you over the edge at the given moment but don't blame them or yell at them. Try to get them to understand, instead. They won't, but it's better this way.

I got drips on my desk like I'm a fucking toddler. FUCK. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Example of incorrect assholishness You guys switched my fucking cup, didn't you. I have enough shit to deal with right now and you fuckers gave me the leaky one. I know somebody did because I never had fucking drips on my fucking desk before fucking this fucking morning. Fuck you. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Also, be in mind not to take out too much aggression on people not in your circle of heroes, so to speak. If you haven't let them in on your plan, you don't get to be a dick to them. You can talk about them later or scream in your car with the windows down but don't go ape shit at the poor sales associate at WalMart because they don't have those seasonal poptarts you liked. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Also, be aware of people trying to take advantage of you while you're in asshole phase. Some people are real assholes. Every day of their lives. And some of them never smoked a day in their life, that's just how they are. These people might try to provoke you or aggravate you into saying something stupid and then punish you for it. You can prepare for such people by avoiding them when possible and bitching about them later when you can't. Being aware of them is usually enough to neutralize their threat. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Okay You're over the worst of it. It's been a few days to a week and now when you're being a dick, it's just you being a dick and not the chemical reactions inside you making you a dick. So you're going to find that you can stop being a dick more easily. Suddenly, you have a lot more control than you did before. [SEP]\", '[CLS] This is the point where it all makes sense. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Unfortunately, the transition between the two states is murky and confusing. The control comes and goes. You can't quite figure out where you begin and the addiction ends for a day or so. And that's okay, too. Just keep plugging away and take out some stress by venting to your heroes same as usual until you're ready. When you feel like yourself again, you're going to think you're done.

[SEP]', '[CLS] I might be late to the party, but here goes. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Complete lifestyle change. You smoke because it's habit. The best way to break any habit is to change the conditions surrounding that habit. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Sleep on the right side of the bed Switch to the left. Drink coffee every morning Switch to orange juice. Drive to work on highway Take instead. Always have a smoke during your break at work Play Candy Crush instead. [SEP]', '[CLS] When every small part of your life has been adjusted ever so slightly, your routines and habits become a bit more malleable and it because a lot easier to quit smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Of course, when you do this, the worst thing you can do is continue smoking throughout. You MUST do it cold turkey. If you keep smoking, the trick won't work nearly as well the next time you try quitting. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Worked for me, hope it works for you. [SEP]', '[CLS] What finally worked for me was to give in, go get a pack of cigarettes, take one out of the pack and smoke it, then crush the rest of the pack. I was too poor to keep smoking like this so I was able to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I took a smoking cessation class at a local teaching hospital, and that along with an understanding partner did the trick for me. I enjoyed learning about the nuts and bolts about addiction, and about tobacco and nicotine. It was nice, for example, to know that each craving would get weaker and weaker. It was nice to be able to taste lettuce. And it honestly made a difference to me to hear that the nicotine in once cigarette takes your body a week to metabolize, which is why people's level of nicotine builds up and up. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Finally, I totally feel you with the work break thing. Take a break anyway, you can still go outside for some fresh air. Just, you know, don't go where the smokers go. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I started doing martial arts every day. I figured if there was something that I wanted more than smoking that I would feel like shit doing if I did smoke I wouldn't be able to smoke for long before kicking it. Took about a month of getting my ass kicked before I have it up. I was going about four hours a day though so it wouldn't have worked if I didn't throw myself in head first. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I just had my two year anniversary of quitting smoking. I finally quit by seeing a hypnotist. I was slightly skeptical at first, but I went the the same hypnotist that helped my aunt quite years earlier and my mom quite years ago, so I knew her reputation and I knew it could work. After the hypnotist session it was still a battle of will to not smoke, but it worked. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I tried everything. I and my GF quit on the way home after taking care of a very nice man with are nasty illness from smoking. I don't think I really wanted to quit before then. Once I really did it was pretty strait forward. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I also work in health filed. I started just telling people I needed a break and guess what they covered me. Strange isn't it. Just don't go around the smokers on a break if you can. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Smoked for years tried to quit many, many times. What finally worked was Chantix and Nicotine gum at the same time. Also played a lot of violent video games for the first few weeks. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I smoked a pack a day for years. I was tired of smoking and wanted to quit.

[SEP]', '[CLS] Ecigs. Started a year ago. the cheapo gas station things that look like cigarettes were total crap, so I moved up to the slightly more advanced vapor devices, and then analog ciagrets were this highly disgusting thing, a cigarette compared to an evapor device is like eating poop compared to a Brazilian steak house. I quit within days of starting.

[SEP]', \"[CLS] You have to want to, meaning for yourself, not just bc you know that rationally it's bad for you. I mean hate it, hate yourself for it, be terrified of dying an agonizing death from lung cancer, etc. When I was a teen young adult, I didn't get it. I knew it was bad bc, well, science and facts, but I felt no consequences personally yet. It didn't effect my health, I worked with hung out with mostly smokers, and I just enjoyed smoking. After about years of it, I started coughing every morning, experienced shortness of breath, and was around more non smokers which made me more aware of how I smelled. Something I did to fit in socially was now ostracizing me. I started dating a non smoker who never made me feel bad about smoking, but served as a reflection of how self conscious I was about it myself, which I had never been shown until then. I was paranoid about how I smelled, tasted, looked smoking, aware of how out of breath I was just walking stairs. I realized I didn't enjoy it anymore. I hated it and hated myself for it. Once I experienced that level of self loathing, cigarettes became the enemy and I quit cold turkey.

So I munched on a hell of a lot of hard candies or chewing gum. I also chewed tobacco dipped for a while to take the edge off which I wouldn't recommend because it was harder to quit that than it was smoking. It sucked the first months, but I toughed it through, and now I can't even stand cigarette smoke, and ask myself why the hell I ever smoked them. But that's how I did it.

I started setting little goals like I want a cigarette now, but I'm going to wait min min min before I actually smoke it. This helped me get a grip on controlling my habit. Not only was I stopping to think about every cigarette I smoked but I was reinforcing that I wanted to stop smoking with every cigarette.

[SEP]', '[CLS] I just cut down the regularity of my smoking. I figured it was a pointless exercise to say I MUST NEVER SMOKE AGAIN so I just gradually refused myself a cigarette now and again, and after a few weeks I just lost the craving.

I had the mental conversation this kinda sucks and is pointless, I'm doing this out of reflex more than anything . So at that point I gave away the rest of my cigs and stopped completely. I stayed on the chantix for another month maybe, even though they say to stay on it for . [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I think the reason why this was feasible for me was the other thing I mentioned, NA meetings. Staying on chantix for months matters because it gets you accustomed to not smoking for an extended period of time, however I was able to use the tools I'd gained from staying away from other drugs and apply that to cigarettes. IE Don't pick up the first one and you wont have the ones that follow. It's a simple concept, but for people who have been addicted to something, they know how it works. You have one, it turns out to be enjoyable and you think, okay I can do this once in awhile. It's more fun this way, once in awhile. Once in awhile turns into weekends, turns into once a day, turns into when you're stressed, turns into breaks, turns into all the time. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The point is, once you've broken the physical part, and you've gained some time away from it completely, it becomes a choice rather than a compulsion. You learn to cope without.

Even though there is an overwhelming desire to do so, I just don't, because I know how hard it is to quit a second or third time. I often lie to myself and think if I go through today without smoking than I can smoke tomorrow but when tomorrow comes I think the same thing again. For six months.

Don't assume that you're special and it won't happen to you. Don't think that you're young and have plenty of time to quit. Each puff that tastes so sweet going down is not so sweet in your body.

I listened to a lot of darker Metal industrial music and made any lyrics I could into my own narrative against addiction, especially any that were about some kind of enemy or nemesis. Addiction is a cruel beast, and imagining myself slicing its stranglehold from my brain made it much easier to finally kick it for good. I'm a quite cerebral person so escaping into music and my own imagination as much as possible made me slay that demon, and it's stayed dead for almost four years now.

It was easy to cut that down to two, then to one. I went from smoking a day to a day over the span of those years. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The final stop was when Lent started.

If I made it to my birthday without smoking, then I would quit but I never thought of it as quitting before then.

It won't convince you to quit, but if you want to, it will help a lot. Another important thing is realizing there is no significant physical addiction nicotine addiction only lasts a week more or less , so that's why patches, pills and whatnot don't work. The real addiction is psychological. So you have to be positive about it. When you see someone smoking, don't think about how relaxed they might be feeling or whatever, think about how their breath and hands smell like shit, how they spend tons of money for something damaging their bodies, how pitiful and enslaved they are for having to go out every hour or so for a smoke, even if it's cold, rainy or whatever.

Varenicline is a nicotinic receptor partial agonist it stimulates nicotine receptors more weakly than nicotine itself does. In this respect it is similar to cytisine and different from the nicotinic antagonist, bupropion, and nicotine replacement therapies NRTs like nicotine patches and nicotine gum. As a partial agonist it both reduces cravings for and decreases the pleasurable effects of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Through these mechanisms it can assist some patients to quit smoking.

I was in the hospital for a weekend, and after that hours of not having the choice to smoke, I thought it would be the best time to quit for good. The physical addiction had already mostly subsided, and I realized that it was mostly psychological. With that mindset, I challenged myself to overcome it, and it got increasingly easier as days passed. Changing your habits, ie  while driving, after meals, while waiting on automated computer procedures downloads was the most difficult thing. I took to eating pretzel rods whenever I found myself reaching for something by instinct, and that helped. It's been years, now, and I'll never smoke again. Good luck to you.

Knowing that my throat infections and need for surgery was at least partially created by my smoking, I decided to quit. [SEP]', \"[CLS] My winning formula was Chantix, and to battle the oral fixation and need to have something in my hands, I used cut up straws and cinnamon sticks as physical substitutes. The cinnamon sticks inparticular were a real winner, they took away the empty feel of not having something between my lips or fingers, and quite honestly tasted nice. And Chantix, well  I know that has quite the reputation but let me be forthright here, I couldn't have done it without Chantix. What the Chantix did basically was made the cigarettes taste terrible, and I mean DISGUSTING. One day, with a pocketful of cinnamon sticks in tow I went to light a cigarette, was immediately repulsed and then I asked myself if I even wanted to finish the cigarette. I put it out, pulled out a cinnamon stick and that was that. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] You need an external stimulus, and tools to help you with the incredible urges. I feel that in a healthcare environment you could easily get away with chewing cinnamon sticks if you cleared it with your supervisor, as it's not inherently dirty and would allow you to start a productive conversation about smoking with your co workers and other patients. Many insurance providers don't pay for Chantix but may pay for Wellbutrin, though if you decide to go with medication you need to be vigilant and watch for any personality or mood changes. If people around you say that you've been acting differently or if you feel different in an unpleasing way, you need to stop taking the medication IMMEDIATELY. Your prescribing doctor or pharmacist can give you clearer information than I, and I recommend that you consult with them rather than trusting to contents of this thread. But I quit years ago and my successful effort was after many failed efforts. Just don't give up hope and one day you'll find your winning combination of tools, external influences and gut level determination.

If you don't truly actually want to quit, it's hard to stay off it when you are successful. Quitting for other concerned people, no matter how right, concerned or close to you they are, isn't enough. Quitting for health reasons, no matter how critical they are, if you don't really actually want to quit is pointless and very unlikely to be permanent. I'm not talking about saying yeah, I'm tired of spending money, it's not good for me, my girlfriend mom wife friends don't like it, I'm talking about those reasons causing a drive that changes YOUR mentality to want to have more money, be healthier, or making you not like it.

I bought one of those e cigarettes and tried that for a little while. I kept just picking up the cigarettes, rather than the e cig. About a month ago, I decided I was just going to do it. I started gradually replacing my cigarette habit with the e cig. For instance, if you smoke once an hour, every other hour have a cigarette, and gradually replace the cigarette all together. The truth is your body doesn't notice the difference between the e cig and the regular cig. Your thoughts do. If you keep telling yourself that it's the cigarette you want, that is what you are going to have. If you tell yourself it is the e cig you want, that is what you are going to have.

[SEP]', '[CLS] I smoked for years and my parents were smokers too. I tried quitting with many different methods, patch, gum, cold turkey, but the only thing that actually worked for me was Chantix. After about a week or so of taking it I would go outside and smoke and actually not feel anything from it.

Anyway I hope OP and whomever else is trying to quit has best of luck with whatever method they choose. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I went cold turkey too, but I did it with a twist. I started the quit with a vacation. I was out of my normal routine for a week, and that really helped because my triggers were routine based walk to the train, smoke walk to my building, smoke let the dog out at night, smoke etc. . Also, I was mostly distracted by the sites that I didn't crave it as much and I was forced to be pleasant because I didn't want to ruin the vacation.

I ended up using lozenges for weeks but realized its really nicotine addiction thats causing the agony and not tobacco. So I asked myself am I really making progress I quit nicotine cold turkey shortly after, and it sucked for a few weeks. Now when I have an impossible feeling task at hand I just remember quitting cigarettes and know I can do anything. Honestly, it's going to be difficult and nothing can really help you.

I loved the act of smoking itself, but it made my hangovers worse, it made me a worse athlete, and I was embarrassed to be seen smoking. The biggest thing for me was that as an on and off smoker, I could actually feel a marked difference in my cardiovascular system between weeks I was smoking and weeks I wasn't. At some point, my foreknowledge of how much worse I would feel if I smoked overcame my cravings. [SEP]\", '[CLS] TBH though, I still sneak a cigarette every now and then.

I also heard and read about how bad smoking is for weight gain. This was the biggest factor in me quitting. I quit months ago and have gained pounds of muscle. I can't say it was entirely from quitting smoking, but I think the results are much better because of that choice. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Dating somebody that didn't smoke was a huge factor.

[SEP]\", '[CLS] Staying out of bars and smokey places was necessary for a while.

Everytime you see one you want one  but that fades over time. I liked to smoke a lot when I drank or played music. It was a social thing since all of my friends smoked. What helped was eliminating each piece individually. For the first couple weeks when i got home i didn't hang out with my friends at all  i could have but it was intentional, it was to quit smoking. What I did almost every night was drink and play quitar by myself  sounds sad but what I was doing was getting used to being drunk and playing music without cigs so the desire wasn't there as much when I was with friends. First day or two it was hard, but quickly became easier. Then when I started hanging out with friends I would just do small groups at first, I would avoid big parties. This made it easier for me to not want to smoke in a social setting. I used to bum cigarettes from my friends a lot, so when I was out with them I told them no matter how hard I beg do not give me cigarettes, I didn't buy any and quit  I didn't say quitting  i said quit again desire has to be there .

I would get winded from doing simple things like walking up a flight of stairs, my fingers, hair, car, clothes reeked of cigarette smoke GROSS and I was getting sick with Bronchitis at least once to twice a year. By the end of years of smoking, I had also developed a pretty gnarly smoker's cough which definitely is not sexy. Hacking up my lungs EVERY morning became a routine. Aside from that, my pack a day habit was becoming very expensive. At this time cigarettes were around a pack not sure how much they are now but I knew there were lots of things I would rather spend a month on. One day, I woke up and I said to myself Im done.

For me, it was bars and drinking in general. I knew that drinking would absolutely trigger me to want to smoke and that I would definitely give in. So I also decided at that time that I would quit drinking. It was only supposed to be temporary but the health benefits were so great that I quit drinking altogether. I might have a glass of wine or champagne once or twice a year, but ultimately I no longer drink socially. You have to treat it like what it is an addiction. Which means you should also remove yourself from any situation where others will be smoking like friends that smoke or co workers that smoke . Find a distraction or different vice. I used licorice, hard candy and or coffee. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The places that require the most discipline to not smoke are in the car while driving and after a big meal.

Don't want to ever go through that again, and . Know that you are capable of succeeding on your own. It makes a big difference.

During this time the most challenging obstacle was over coming the anxiety from cravings. I would have to give myself positive affirmations, telling myself you're gonna be ok. No harm will come to you if you don't light up. Which is what anxiety is. It's your body warning you something bad will happen if you don't get what you need.

Denying yourself a habit is one thing, actively participating is other healthy activities really offsets that void. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Two things. One was deciding to start a family, and knowing that I didn't want my kids to be exposed that. The other more practical approach I took was to gradually cut back. I got down to one a day, and thought this is stupid, and then I quit. Went without for a couple weeks, then feel of the wagon one night. After waking up the next morning and bring barely able to breathe, that was it. Haven't smoked since. Good luck to you. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Turning , having young kids, and pains in my chest when I took deep breaths. [SEP]', '[CLS] Quitting drinking at the same time. [SEP]', '[CLS] First you have to decide you actually want to quit. once i made the choice for myself, not because my husband was telling me to, or because my parents were on my ass , i stocked up on sunflower seeds and toothpicks. Sunflower seeds helped for when i was outside or in my car. otherwise, just keeping a toothpick in my mouth helped calm the urges. the chemical addiction is gone after days, the rest is all mental. You got this. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Willpower first of all, followed by a replacement ritual really helped me. The cravings are really tough the first couple of days but eventually pass, just force yourself to do something else everytime you have a craving, whether it's a little gesture, which is what I replaced it with, along with repeating a mantra in my mind everytime I got a craving. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I'm coming up on years w out a cigarette and can say the cravings mostly pass, although there will ALWAYS be times, especially when stressed, when I want one. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Cold turkey worked best for me, I used toothpicks the time before last and stayed off em for months. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I got pregnant. When I found out, I immediately halved the amount I was smoking. It took me about weeks to be completely smoke free. I wished I could have quit cold turkey, but finding out I was pregnant was crazy stressful, and when I'm stressed I smoke. [SEP]\", '[CLS] It my not be feasable for you to get pregnant, but it worked for me. [SEP]', '[CLS] It really was just having the utmost desire to quit. [SEP]', '[CLS] To get that desire I had to go through a lot. First I grew up with my father as a smoker, and I hated it. Then in my teens he dated a woman who was a smoker, I hated it too. She had even quit once but started smoking in front of me again on my birthday I was pissed . [SEP]', \"[CLS] Of course later in my teen years, peer pressure, desire to be cool, following in my parents footsteps, etc. I started smoking. I got pretty heavy into it and was a pack a day guy within a couple of years. I tried to quit many many times but really didn't have enough motivation to go through with it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Then I watched my father die of cancer. It was heartbreaking, and the memory of sitting next to him in his bedroom as he took his final breath haunts me to this day. But even that wasn't enough. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] What finally got it to stick was deciding to have a kid   I didn't want her to grow up and watch me die the same way. So I got the patch and weeks later I ditched that. I haven't been a smoker since I relapsed once for a night a few months later but thats it . Its ultimately my desire to want to set a good standard for my daughter that keeps me off of it. I still get the cravings and its been years since I quit. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I smoked weed everytime I wanted to smoke a cigarette. Not to get high just to smoke. I would smoke joints a day. After a couple weeks, I got sick of being high all the time. years into quitting now. Wouldnt even call myself a smoker anymore, and I don't smoke weed anymore either. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Chantix was my savior. Tried several times without and just couldn't do it. After about a week of taking it the 'buzz' you get goes away and cigs taste HORRIBLE. You also are cutting back during the week because you don't have that pressure as often or as strong. So then you stop. It will suck for a couple of days, you will be grumpy, you will have CRAZY VIVID dreams. These dreams can be bad if you have bad dreams anyway, I fortunately, do not have that problem. [SEP]\", '[CLS] For me at about a month or so in the pills started making me nauseous, this happens to a lot of people, but I just started cutting the pills in half and that let me taper off of them. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The first time I did this I went about three years without. Then made the mistake of smoking one night when drunk. Then started back within the next month. Did the cycle again and now haven't smoked in a couple of years. The urges still exist but when I get them and they are bad I tell my self that if I smoke one, then I will smoke , and it just isn't worth it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] First, you need to be yourself totally sick of smoking and have this incessant desire to quit. You must be totally convinced in the head that smoking is disgusting and there's absolutely NO good reason you should smoke another cigarette in your life. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Once you get there, just quit cold turkey. Man up and ride out the urges the first few weeks. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Social pressure. None of my friends smoke. I work in the health care field. None of my colleagues smoke. The ones that did, quit. When I go outside to smoke a cigarette, I get bored. That's it, really. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Sunflower seeds. But then I had to use cigarettes to kick my seeds addiction. [SEP]', \"[CLS] But in all seriousness cold turkey worked for me. You just need to be strong as shit. Working retail jobs don't help either. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Triple bypass surgery did it for my uncle. He was loving those menthols since he was an army cook in Korea. If he can quit, anyone can. [SEP]', '[CLS] I started to play soccer at a indoor league. At first I switched to dip to help with the nicotine cravings then stopped the dip slowly. I felt like soccer gave me relatively quick feedback for quitting. good luck. [SEP]', '[CLS] My uncles death from lung cancer lifetime smoker . [SEP]', \"[CLS] it's you vs yourself in this situation. who will come out on top. [SEP]\", '[CLS] What worked for me second attempt was quitting cold turkey but with an actual reason to quit. The reason was my willpower on bad days. I also set out to develop a new way to cope with stress since that was when I felt most dependant on cigarettes. I would remove myself from any stressful situation at the first opportunity and take a walk for a couple of minutes. Good luck. [SEP]', '[CLS] Pregnancy. Had to quit cold turkey, totally worked out. [SEP]', '[CLS] I got sick of being out of breath, smelling, and doing something I knew was shit for my overall well being. So I quit. No goals, deals, gimmicks or games. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Its all willpower and mental strength. I didn't need gum or lollipops to offset the cravings. It was quite simple, actually. I feel those who say its so hard don't really have the desire to quit, they just think they do. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] SOURCE Smoked for years, nearly . packs a day. Put them down years ago and haven't had one since. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] When I quit, it was two months after I got to watch my grandfather die of lung cancer, and I decided that's not the way I want to go. For me the memory of his last few weeks really helped me through the trying times. I used an e cig as a crutch for about a week, moved to the nicotine free cartridges, and really, kept drinking a ton of water. I was never so hydrated. Cigarette cravings seemed to decrease after slamming oz of cold water. Doing non smoking activities go to the movies, bowling, keep your hands and mind occupied . One of my friends gave me a stress ball that I kept in my coat pocket that I used while walking around outside, when I would usually be smoking. Driving was difficult, we don't realize the rituals we set for ourselves until we try to change them. Once again, water and LOUD music seemed to get me over this hump. But mostly, I really really really wanted it. There's no magic bullet. It's going to suck, and it's going to suck a lot. But having that motivation is what grinds you through. For me it was not wanting my kids to go through what my mom and uncles went through with their dad, that slow decline, that agonizing end. But it could be anything. Money you save. Your general health. Lower insurance rates. As long as that's stronger than the temporary desire to light up, you'll get through this. Signed, ex smoker of years, tobacco free for three. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I was put on wellbutrin for mild depression. The pills didn't help my mood but they made me never want to smoke. It actually looked gross to me after I started. I'm still smoke free. Hooray. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] A family member of mine was diagnosed with lung cancer and the day that happened was the day I quit cold turkey and haven't had any problems since. Its been years and I feel fine. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I went cold turkey and just refused to allow myself to take even one puff. Don't tell yourself I'll just have one puff or I'll just have one cigarette. . That's your addiction playing tricks on you, next thing you know you bought a pack and are back to your normal level of smoking. [SEP]\", '[CLS] What also helped was starting the quit when I was sick and smoking would have made me feel worse. When I felt better I thought Well, I just went two days without smoking, might as well keep it going . [SEP]', \"[CLS] For me, I quit using the Nicorette inhaler. Any brand inhaler will work. What REALLY helped me was ignoring the filter of the time. They say you go through a day when you smoke pack a day, but I went through maybe a week. I would inhale on it knowing that there was no nicotine left in the filter, but the hand to mouth gesture was enough of a reminder to trick my brain into thinking I wasn't jonesing for nicotine. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I recommend people to find a reason to quit as well, rather than just yeah I should quit . My reason was that my girlfriend HATED it, plus I was becoming a Resident Assistant for my dorms and I didn't want to be the only RA who smoked. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I used Chantix. The dreams were weird but fun, though towards the end I noticed I was a little more on edge than normal. I quit for a year but relapsed due to a stressful situation and basically allowing myself to restart. I did Chantix again and have stayed away ever since. It also helps knowing and if it's not true I still prefer ignorance that insurance will only pay twice in a lifetime for it. Knowing I can't get it again is a powerful deterrent. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Quit days ago. What helped me was an e cig with a small amount of nicotine in the juice. Used it for about two weeks, smoking less and less every day until I didn't need it anymore. You can get juice with no nicotine in it, which helps with the habit and feeling of smoking. Also, being serious about quitting helps. All of my failed attempts in the past were from not really wanting to quit but feeling like I should. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My husband bought me a vaporizer pen kanger and I started alternating between it and smoking, then when I ran out of cigarettes I just didn't buy anymore and used the pen exclusively. I've been smoke free for a month. The e cig did nothing for me, with the vaporizer you can control how much nicotine yiu actually get. Good luck, you can do this. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I was put on wellbutrin for mild depression. The pills didn't help my mood but they made me never want to smoke. It actually looked gross to me after I started. I'm still smoke free. Hooray. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit smoking a year ago. What worked for me was cold turkey, find the reason you want to quit and stick at it. I was a pack a day smoker for years. [SEP]', \"[CLS] I had tried to quit smoking several times over the years and was always tripped up by Sure one won't hurt or I'll only smoke at weekends or I'll only smoke when I'm drinking or I'll only when I'm in company . There's no such thing. You just got to stick at it. [SEP]\", '[CLS] When I quit I read advice on the r stopsmoking sub, someone said that as Nicotine is carried in the blood, you need to clean your blood as soon as possible. How you do this is eat loads of fiber and anti oxidents blueberries, pineapple , and basically have the greatest bowel movements of your life for weeks. [SEP]', '[CLS] What also helped me was making fists with your toes everytime you want a cig. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Be warned though, I may be a year in, but there isn't a day goes by without me still thinking I'd love a cigarette. I was at a party last week and of course, all the smokers are outside laughing and having fun, I was stuck inside with a bore. I went out to join the smokers, I didn't have a cigarette but I really wanted one. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Having my father died, I was in my early twenties and when my father died due to lung cancer it convinced everyone in my family who smoked that we should quit or we'll end up the same way. [SEP]\", '[CLS] I quit twice. The first time was because I said I would, and so I did. It lasted about three months, and when I got the opportunity to start up again I did. I thought at the time I would just have a smoke or two and no big deal but pretty soon I was back on the horse, looking for my stetson. [SEP]', \"[CLS] The second time, I just did it. I didn't even know it was going to happen on that day. It was at the point where I was embarrassed to admit to people I met that I smoked. I wanted to quit and I was just trying to figure out when and where to do it. One day I woke up, and I was like I think I'm done. I threw away my leftover cigarettes and didn't buy any more. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] That was over years ago now. I still dream, every now and again, about how I have an occasional smoke, or how I pick up the habit for a couple weeks at a time then quit all over again. I don't dare. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I think what made it easier for me was that I simply did not go places where smoking was a part of the social fabric of things. Early on I really missed the break it gave me minutes every couple hours hanging out with the other smokers. These days I don't miss it so much. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Cold turkey wasn't easy, but it was easier than anything else I tried. The second time I tried it, I knew what I was in for, and I just never let my resolve waver. [SEP]\", '[CLS] honestly, stop trying to replace it with anything. [SEP]', '[CLS] I did not go cold turkey, i used a patch for a week or two. [SEP]', \"[CLS] But i had friends who tried to quit around the same time and they're still smoking, and i quit years ago. [SEP]\", '[CLS] The mistakes i saw them make. [SEP]', \"[CLS] Trying to go out and party while quitting, the first few weeks will be hard so don't put yourself in situations where you love to smoke. I just worked a lot. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] taking the patch off to 'just have one'. Seriously. [SEP]\", '[CLS] Trying to quit right before we went on vacation. I had this one friend who would attempt to quit right before we would go on a yearly two week road trip when college ended. That was doomed to always fail and cause him stress. [SEP]', \"[CLS] To quit you just have to quit. Just don't do it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] The crappy feeling will go away. The daily roller coaster of 'i feel great' to 'i feel like crap' will be replaced with 'i feel fine'. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] My advice is harsh because i do not have an addictive nature, so it's like when you ask someone how to do something that they have been doing for a long time, I don't know, you just do it . [SEP]\", '[CLS] Truth is, the only way to quit is to quit. To stop smoking. [SEP]', \"[CLS] These e cigs and stuff are nice but honestly i feel like you're just leaning off one crutch for another. Stand up and do it in this case don't do it. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] So many things combined for the perfect storm, really. It was right after new years, my girlfriend had just quit, I had been leaning towards it for awhile but needed an extra push. I went out to breakfast one morning, decided I would shave my head. Hadn't shaved my head since I was in middle school. From that haircut, I never smoked a cigarette again. The first few weeks are the hardest, but now, it feels like I just never smoked, I almost never THINK about smoking, and that's the biggest thing. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] In your case, I would say replace it with something else. Something similar but not bad for you, I used toothpicks. They cover the oral fixation pretty well. Also use the patch, it sounds silly, but you do actually get a serious buzz the first few times, and you get that nicotine rush. I never tried the e cigs as a quitting method, but in my observations, I've seen people just go back and forth between them and there's not enough mental separation from the e cig to a regular cig, so people regress too easily. Toothpicks, go out for a toothpick and cell phone break. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I've battled with smoking tobacco for many years. I gave up smoking completely two years ago and haven't had one since. All I did was stop. No pills no new habit. Just stopped. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] Who gives a shit how you quit, just quit. I used Chantix and it was the only thing that really helped me and I tried everything the gum, patches, etc . It's been nearly five years since I quit and I haven't relapsed once. This is after years of smoking and Skoal. Biggest piece of advice I can give is do not think for a moment that you can just have one . That is the biggest mistake I think people make. I took the medicine for months to the dude who has been on it for years WTF. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] I had just recovered from pneumonia for the rd time in a year. The third time was so crippling that I was actually afraid I was going to die. I remember when I first got sick that third time that I was thinking, ugh, I have to quit smoking until I'm better or it's going to take forever to get over it. Then as each day passed and I kept getting worse and worse my thought process shifted from quitting until I was better to quitting for good or I would NEVER get better. [SEP]\", \"[CLS] It really scared me that I thought I was going to die and as a Mom I couldn't stand the thought of leaving my kid and having him be sad and angry at me for letting myself die over a pack and a half a day cigarette habit. It really sobered me to realize that, realistically, I was picking my cigarettes over him. So, that was that. I never picked up another cigarette after I recovered from that pneumonia and it's been officially days. I've not smoked , cigarettes and I've saved . thanks Quit.net for the daily reminder .
