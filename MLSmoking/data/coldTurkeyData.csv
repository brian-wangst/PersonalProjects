"The hardest thing is on a day that you’re bored. You notice at the most. But if you’re just sitting there playing video games or just sitting there doing work or homework, you start to feel it.  
The more you think about it the more your head starts to hurt.  "
"I used to get places 10 minutes early so I could smoke one or two beforehand, sounds absolutely stupid but my timekeeping is absolutely terrible now, I'm constantly late for stuff

Other than that, quitting cold turkey was easy, I didn't wait to finish a pack - I think I had about 16 cigs left in the pack when I decided I was done, if I'd finished the pack first I would have made excuses to keep smoking. If that made sense"
Not relapsing. Seems like the obvious answer but it's really hard not to relapse when your brain constantly tries to find excuses to smoke.
I just realized that smoking pork was way more delicious. Turkey doesnt hold the flavor from smoking the way that pork does.

But knowing all the damage I'm doing, especially to my teeth has stopped me.

So basically, knowing I would lose my teeth stopped me."

People. Other people are much harder to deal with when your brain is constantly seeking out ways to manipulate you into finding excuses to smoke again.
"Missing cigarettes.

Nah but seriously, it’s aside from the sensation it’s just having something to do. It seems like a very different experience walking down the road without a cig than with one. You’re not speaking up, holding anything, flicking ash, bringing your hand up and down to your mouth.
That’s why vapes have been a godsend to me. I don’t even need nicotine, it’s just the sensation of the action I miss."
"There's a couple things most people have trouble with when quitting that make it harder.  First, you have to actually want to quit. I know from experience that many times I tried to quit I didn't want to quit, I was trying to quit because everyone was telling me to. Second, just because you stumble doesn't erase your progress. Smoking a cigarette after a couple days doesn't mean you've failed, we're fallible. Don't throw your hands up and give up because you fell to temptation. Continue trying. Addiction is a beast, but we're animals that thrive in adversity. "
"Someone I work with is trying to switch to a healthier lifestyle, had been trying for a long time before she realized that slipping up once doesn't erase all the progress you've made. Same thing I had to learn when I tried to go a year without drinking. And this is probably the best advice for trying to overcome anything."
"The part about slipping up is the real key.  My wife and I quit 4 or 5 years ago I really can't remember exactly when.

 We both went cold turkey. We do still pick up a pack of smokes if we are going out to drink and know we will be drunk.  A night out heavily drinking which we only do once a month or every other month we might split a quarter pack and then just give the pack to one of our smoker friends when we leave.    

People always give us shit about killing our progress but whatever.  It works for us and certainly beats a pack a day each."
"My biggest problem is that I want to quit, but I want to smoke.

I LOVE smoking.  Reason: It makes me feel good.  I hate smoking, it tastes terrible, it makes me cough, it costs so much money, I am often smoking alone, outside in the cold nowdays.  It fucking sucks.  But it makes me feel good.  It's so relaxing.  A few hours without a cigarette is painful.  

Addiction is more than a beast, it's a fucking monster.  It warps your brain into loving the feeling of being gross.

I know it's gross, I know it's slowly killing me, I know it stinks, I know it costs me a lot of money...but my brain doesn't care.

The way I see it: My body tortures me when I deprive it of nicotine.  So I smoke to feel normal, not because I want to feel the relaxing effect, but because that relaxing effect, is what normal used to be.

I want to quit, but the hold it has on my body is greater because smoking makes me feel good."
"Any tips for making yourself actually want to quit? I know I need to, I just don't want to. I've even considered hypnosis. "
"> you have to actually want to quit

Yeah, this. Quitting is easy. Wanting to quit is hard. I've quit like 5 or 6 times (defined as no smoking for a week+), but I always kinda *want* to smoke.
"
"So I just fell into this, accidentally quitting smoking because of a cracked rib.  I think about a certain look on peoples' faces at AA meetings, the ones that said, ""I'm only doing this bullshit because I have to do this bullshit.""  It's the same thing.  

However, I've managed to stick with it because this isn't the first time I've quit, and something I noticed the last time I quit (for about three years) seems pretty important.  

That feeling you get when you want to smoke a cigarette after you've quit smoking?  That twitchy, ancey, can't scratch that itch feeling?  It's the exact same feeling you get just before you light up a cigarette.  In other words, you actually experience that addict's separation MORE AS A SMOKER than you do as one who has quit.  After a couple of weeks the urges hit me only a few times a day instead of twenty, when I was actually smoking.  

It's still bullshit, though.  I didn't want to quit and every single day I can think of good reasons to go back and enjoy myself.  I think if I can stick with it another month or so I'll be fine.  But I might say, ""fuck it,"" too, because I don't really want to quit.  I'm only doing it because the opportunity arose and my conscience demands that I try it.  I need a fucking blow job.  
"
Yup. Smoked about a pack in total in the 3 months after I quit. But haven't smoked in 4 years now.
I second this completely. You have to want to. Like properly have to. No pretending to yourself. I smoked for 10ish years and knew I wanted to stop by the time I turned 30. I wanted to stop. It's almost a state of mind 
"The first one is very true. I just don’t have the motivation within myself to want to quit.

Besides the health risks (which feel so far away from me now since I’m only in my 20’s), I don’t personally see why I should quit..."
"This advice is on point. I successfully quit cold turkey on the first try. Everyone asks me what my secret was and simply put, I allowed myself to cheat. If I was feeling really stressed or having a bad craving, I'd allow myself to have a cigarette. Eventually, I got to the point where I didn't get those cravings anymore."
"I feel like there's a certain level of shame you have to hit before you can really commit to it. I was never a big smoker, but spent a long time as a can-per-day chewer. What compelled me to quit was something my 2 pack-per-day neighbor said to me. We were out on our porches, he was smoking and I was chewing. He told me, ""seems like every time I see you there's something in your lip"". Holy shit that hit me hard. My chain smoking neighbor notices my tobacco habit? It must be bad. I was able to quit within a couple weeks of then and it's been almost 3 years now."
"Yes, and education re effects was helpful to me."
"“ you have to want to quit” this is good for people to note.  

At the doctors office when the nurse confirms some stuff they ask about smoking. I usually lie because before theyd just say “ you should stop it’s bad for you”.

Last time I didn’t lie and I was surprised when she said “ when you’re ready to quit we can help”
Powerful stuff. "
Great advices
"> First, you have to actually want to quit.

My mother successfully quit after smoking for 30+ years and said this exact thing. She said the times she had tried in the past, she didn't really want to."
"Absolutely this. I can't recall how many times I started again because I had a couple smokes and felt like I failed at quitting. 

The other thing this helped with is that previously when I quit it felt like I would ""Never"" smoke again, and I hated the ""forever"" not being able to do something I enjoy thought. Just take it one day at a time if you break down and smoke just enjoy it and go back to quitting the next day. You didn't fail, you just took a break."
"so many people are like ""it'd be cool if i didnt smoke it'd save me money and blah blah blah"" thats not enough to quit. You have to actually want to quit knowing that you are wasting money and damaging your health not that just oh itd be cool if i didnt smoke, thats not enough motivation and THATS why people fail at quitting. You have to want it"
This is it. You have to really want to quit. Not for anyone else but for yourself. I smoked for 13 years. I tried to quit and failed a few times. It wasn't until I was so sick of being sick all the time that I was finally able to kick the habit. I was sick with a bad head cold (I used to get those a lot when i smoked) and then i just stayed in bed for a whole weekend. It sucked and I thought I was going to die but by the time Monday came around I was sure I could keep it up. It's been a year and a half and I haven't smoked once since that weekend. Sure some times I get a craving but I don't really want to start again. I feel so much better now. 
"I can second that you have to want it. You are never going to kick the habit until you yourself decide you want to quit.

I tried everything in the book, and what finally made me give it up once and for all was because I was about to spend a large chunk of money on a new car and didn't want to ruin it with cigarette smoke and burns. You sometimes find motivation is some really strange places."
"> First, you have to actually want to quit.

This


I can't stress this one enough.  Seriously, this is your biggest stumbling block.  You have to want it.  Seriously want it.

I tried quitting many times, for my health, for my girlfriend,  for convience...no matter what reason i had, no matter what plan I had, whether cold turkey, gum, the patch, whatever...it always ended up in failure.

One day, i realized just how much money I was spending, and just said ""fuck it, I don't want to do this anymore"".  I seriously wanted to quit.  And, it was fairly easy.  I got on the patch for 2 months, and after that, I've been tobacco free for around 6 years now."
I don’t even smoke but this motivated me to stop smoking 
"so true, if you even have questions about whether you want to or not, youll fail. "
"To add to that what helped me was puffing without inhaling. I quit because I wanted to get life insurance and they do a urine test for drugs and cigarettes. No point paying more my whole life for it. Got some test kits to check myself on Amazon and figured after i get the insurance I can start again. Well after 2.5 weeks of mostly cold turkey it became hard to inhale the random cigarette whichout feeling sick. So I would puff but not inhale. Took about 3 months of this random puffing cig game till i no longer even craved one. In fact it now smells bad to me 8/10 times. After 3 months by the way it was flushed out and I was able to take get life insurance for a fraction of the cost. I'll save about $40,000 over the course of the policy.

No point picking it up again now as cravings are gone. Only thing I miss is taking breaks during 14-16 hour work marathon and planning my next steps. Need an hourglass or something."
"What you say is very true. I would like to add that cravings are temporary. And as you get past a craving, they get shorter with more time between cravings. So each craving you beat makes it just a bit easier. "
Never give up. Forgive yourself and try again. 
"This is pretty much what I came to say.  I think by far the most important thing, and the thing that stops most people, is number one.  Or at least it was for me.  I smoked for 16 years and tried to quit several times.  Longest I made it was 4 months then I went on a cruise and bam, right back to 1.5 packs a day!  I tried e-cigs but it was really not the same thing.  I enjoyed smoking and even though I thought I ***should*** quit I really didn't want to.  Not really deep down inside.  

Finally around 2010 I just got fed up with spending so much money to stink all the damn time and I just quit.  Haven't had a cigarette since.  It wasn't easy.  The cravings were difficult.  It was a really strange time honestly but they only lasted a few months and then I was mostly fine.  I still want a cigarette every now and then but it's more like an impulse, just a thought that pops into my mind, than a physical craving.  I even dream of smoking sometimes lol.  I'm happy that I quite though for sure.  "
"So, how do you know when you want to quit and when someone else is influencing you to quit?"
"> Smoking a cigarette after a couple days doesn't mean you've failed, we're fallible.

Ultimately, I've also came to the conclusion, that self-flagellation doesn't change much at the end of the day."
"Respectfully, I kinda disagree with the smoking a cig after trying to quit. As a former smoker myself whom also attempted to quit several times, you need to make up your mind. Are you a smoker or not? Then stay strong if you decide it's time that quit. Cold turkey is the only way to truly quit. If you have a cig while trying to quit you've just reset the clock from your last smoke and you'll have to rego the withdrawal all over again. My best advice is to get something to keep you busy. Smoking is not only a chemical dependency but also an physical or oral fixation. I quit with the help of a very big bag of butter rum lifesavers. Decision is yours in the end, are you going to be a smoker or are you going to be a former smoker? "
"Brush your teeth after every meal or cup of coffee. For me, the taste of food or coffee in my mouth would trigger the need for a cigarette.

It's not good for your teeth to brush them too often, but it's worth doing it during the first two weeks."
That honestly sounds like a solid strategy for me. I always long for a cigarette after I've eaten.
Chew gum instead
"Not only not good to brush often, but brushing after an acidic drink, particularly coffee, will rub off the enamel which is irreplaceable. *This is only an issue for 30 minutes post your last drink, and using a soft brush head helps with enamel loss."
I’m pretty sure smoking is worse for your teeth than brushing too often. 
Brush lightly for only a minute using a soft bristle brush.  No harm done.
I used this technique but with mouth wash as it was easier to carry around with me
Taste of food in my mouth triggers the need for more food for me lol
Can you enlighten me why it’s not good to brush your teeth too often? If it helped someone quit smoking for a year wouldn’t brushing your teeth more often be healthier than smoking?
"So this might work great for a couple days, and then when your out with your friends having a few drinks or you're late coming home from work and grab a snack at the train station suddenly you get the nicotine shivers and bam you're back to smoking ...."
"Oooo, that's a good catch. Coffee still imprinted with cigarettes for me."
You could just brush your tongue instead.

Exercise and sunflower seeds did it for me.  Smoke free since 2009
So do you grind them up before you smoke them or what?

+1 for Sunflower seeds.  I did that as well.  Started the exercise bit later.  4+ yrs now.
"Congratulations, I use to smoke quite often but now i've dialed it down a decent amount although how do you escape the constant lure and pull especially when mates are smoking around you? "
Sunflower seeds are as addictive as hell.
How do you exercise. I'm guessing you skulk around at night with a revolver hunting lizards.
Semechki?
Mr Sir? is that you?
"+1 for me. Especially when driving. 

Lower the window spit seeds out... I used to drive 4-6 hours for my job constantly. This is how I finally quit. 

I uses snus /Gum/etc at first to wean off nicotine.. but seeds were my long term habitual helper I could have anywhere. 

The only thing that trapped me for awhile was social events and social anxiety. A smoke used to be my escape when my anxiety raised. I realized that I could just say I needed to make a call or needed some air... but it took time. "
I am currently unable to quit. I just wanted to say congratulations and good advice :) 
Mr. Sir? 
"This guy read ""holes"" and took it to heart."

My child asked me to stop because he was genuinely worried for my health. That look on his face as he begged me was l I needed. I went cold turkey and haven’t slipped up in four years this month. 
"couldnt sleep when i was a kid. came down crying to my dear fat her begging him to stop for so many nights. he looked me in the eyes and promised he would stop eventually. 20 years later, he hasnt stopped and now i stopped caring."
"My sisters and I tried doing that with our mom about her cigarettes and her drinking, she just got mad and left probably to go smoke the stress away. "
"I asked my mom to stop smoking about 35 years ago now. And she did.
Kudos to you!!"
"Yeah, I had to have a conversation with my son because his (slightly older) cousin had told him smoking is really bad and kills you, and he was really upset, not wanting to believe her.

As much as you might justify continuing smoking to yourself, trying to put that justification into words whilst explaining the harm it does just doesn't work, and serves as a kick up the arse.

Not nearly as far down the line as you though, I'm about 6 months in, vaping only (although I started, indavertantly, with a massive drop in nicotine so had some heavy withdrawls) "
I tried this so many times with my parents but their addiction just wouldn’t let them stop. My dad died from a smoking-related condition and my mum just puffs on in full denial. 
I stopped because I found out I was pregnant. Giving up coffee was harder than cigarettes just thinking of what one could do to my unborn child. I recently had her and have had zero desire to smoke one. 
"I read somewhere that cold turkey is really the only effective way. Personally, I've tried tapering off and it didn't work for me at all because the cigarettes are still always there and I just couldn't stop myself from teaching for one, although it did help me cut back a bit. I did the cold turkey thing too and a stuck for a little bit, but stress got me right back on the wagon (or off? I'm not really sure how the wagon works). I switched to a vape though and its helped my lungs. I keep telling myself that I'll quit but truthfully I'm afraid of what other vice I may pick up to replace it. Good for you though! It's not an easy thing to do. "
Same thing for me except it was my now wife. She cried about me possibly dying early and having to live on without me. Really tore me up. 2 years cig free
Kids are a great motivation to stop smoking. My brother stopped daily smoking when he got his new girlfriend because she hated it. He would still smoke a lot at parties and some here and there. Hasn't smoked since my niece was born.
"I've lost a lot of family members to cancer, particularly lung cancer, it's a terrible way to go and as everyone is standing around them dying, it's gut-wrenching to see the look of blame on their face, knowing it was their fault for smoking. I'm currently 6-8 months without one, vaping helped me quit easily avoiding and not going to bars/drinking.  As much as everyone talks shit about the Jul vape, it literally helped me quit smoking so easily and then it's just a matter of not vaping, which is a hell of a lot easier than not smoking imo."
"My dad chewed tobacco for more than 25 years. All it took for him to quit was my little brother asking him to stop. My little brother was younger than 10 years old and my older brother, sister and myself never asked him to stop. "
I've been asking my mom to stop since I was 6. I'm almost 20 now. Still waiting. :(
"This is exactly what happened to me. 

6 year olds can be brutally honest. "
My mom never stopped telling me how I was a selfish little bitch for wanting to take smoking away from her. 
Wish my dad would listen...I've begged so many times 
When I got asthma and was sent to the hospital when I was 4 my mom quit cold turkey for me. My dad’s asthma apparently wasn’t the deal breaker. Forever grateful. 
"i quit when my first was born, he's 5 now. It sucks at first obviously but now I find it really offensive when I smell. Ive tried one here and there and cant even finish it. 

There's no tricks, just stop and accept the fact that it going to suck. "
"Lol, I tried this for 30 years with my mom, she still smokes. "
As a child I used to break my father cigarettes. He would leave (and return) with a fresh pack. Thanks to my studies in the 3rd grade I knew that cigarettes were awful for you.  I would break roughly 7-10 of them. I felt bad breaking them because I ended up costing him money but at the same time I didn't want him smoking. 
But that would mean I would have to have a child... And start Smoking...
"My daughter (6) put up post it notes ""Stop Smoking! Go talk to your doctor!""  Currently on Chantix and doing pretty well."
That's how me and my sister got my mom to stop smoking. When we were little we were scared she would die because of what we learned about smoking in school. 
I started doing that to my parents as soon as I could form sentences. They never quit. Dad died at 59 and mom at 62. Dad didn't last till my college graduation and neither of them made it to my wedding. Tell your kid he's lucky!
"I got my Aunt to stop smoking when I was younger because I said she stunk when I went to sit on her lap (oh, child honesty). She quit that day.

Apparently I said the same thing to my uncle too. He didn't care as much, still smokes."
"I remember learning about tobacco and alcohol in elementary school. 3rd grade or so. I came home absolutely freaking out because my parents smoked cigarettes IN THE HOUSE, directly next to me and my little brother all the time since we were born. My dad also always had a beer in his hand. 

They basically told me to shut up and get over it. That adults can do what they want. We continued that unit and school and that whole week I remember being an absolute wreck and fearing for their lives haha. I remember an instance where I raised my hand in class and told the teacher that I asked my parents to stop and told him and the what they said. The teacher really didn’t say anything and no one played with me at recess that day because “my parents are gross”. 

You’re a good dad. Thank you for doing this for your kiddo "
Hey congrats! 
"My dad quit for years and has been caught multiple times (by myself, my mom, and my sister) and even after watching us sob and beg him to quit, he's still doing it. We don't know what to do to get him to stop.

His smoking put him in the hospital recently and the doctors are honestly surprised he hasn't died yet."
You are stronger than my mother. Both her kids did that at separate times and she still smokes.
My dad told me to stop being a bitch
i cried and cried and cried when i found out my dad smoked. he took his last cigarette out of the  box and wrote the date on it as a promise he would stop. that little fucker didn’t.

So have a kid? Is that the tip?
"When my twin and I were 3 and my older brother was 6, we asked our parents to stop because we didn't like it.  They did.  Amazing.

Mom had smoked a pack of normal cigarettes a day and dad smoked two packs of unfiltered Camels a day.

I *think* I remember my older brother orchestrating the whole thing, but I'm super glad he did."
Good for fucking you. Seriously. You must be a great parent.
My mother has said that she wants to stop but I’ve never actually seen her do it. I do think that me developing asthma do to it was a wake up call to her however.
The love of my life asked me to quit so that we could spend more time together. 
"My 4 year old told me he thought my smokes were so cool (fire and all) and he couldn't wait until he got big just so he could smoke.

I threw them away then and there. I have had a few since but never gave up due to a slip up on my end."
"Fuck man this one hit hard. I haven’t thought of this in years. I remember making a poster for my mom asking her to quit. My brother told me it would make her sad so I never showed her and never asked her to quit. She wilted away, fell to the rot of cancer then remission for one day. One day. One day of remission. One day free from oncoming death. On the way to eat at a Mexican joint that’s no longer there. Mom is talking oddly. We sit down. With out a moment the fumbling of crying scared and running 8 year old boy pleading for a doctor a brother in shock and a father crying and doing his best to help my mother. A Grand mal seizure that would end up boiling her mind to nothing. The cancer had spread to her brain. She died that day. Not her body that would take time. But her, mom she died. One day. We never heard her voice again not a word. Too Ra loo Ra loo that sweet song I sing to my son is the only memory I have of her voice. Did she even know? We knew.  What if? What if I had showed her my poster? "
"> cold turkey

Good for you, I went cold turkey 10 years ago.  I've always felt that anything else is just substituting one habit for another.

"
"It's a mental game. You have to want to quit. By the end of my time as a smoker, I hated it. The way I smelled, hacking in the middle of the night, winded going up stairs, doctor's appointments were shameful. I got fed up and just stopped one day. Stopping isn't hard, sustaining is. Every time I thought about smoking, I thought about how disappointing it would be to go back to day 0. Smoke free since January 2015."
"I think this is exactly it. You can use tools to help, but if you don't actually want to quit, you aren't going to quit. Any time someone says ""I am going to try to quit"", I already know they will fail. If they really wanted to quit, ""try"" wouldn't even be in that sentence. 

I agree with your second part too. One drag puts you back at 0, the idea of that definitely helps you stay smoke free. "
"How long into the ""quitting"" do you notice that it's getting easier?"
"How many a day did you smoke? I've been smoking for 3 years, now and I only really have a bit of a smoker's cough. Don't wake up hacking, don't get winded going up stairs though, I do a lot of labour for work so, that might help keep my lung capacity better. Maybe I just haven't smoked for long enough or, 10 smokes a day isn't enough to cause those symptoms in 3 years. "
I quit smoking when I was out of town. Not beeing around those places I usually smoked at (and the people I smoked with) really helped since most of the addiction is routine imo.
It definitely is routine. Part of my routine used to be starting the day off with a cup of coffee and cigarette. So I stopped drinking coffee and stopped smoking cigarettes! Now I drink tea for my caffeine 😬
"I did one better. I actually quit right before moving. And then all my friends knew me as a nonsmoker, so nobody was ever asking me to go out and smoke with them.

Quit right before grad school, which sounds totally counterintuitive, but I was ready for the change. Sounded better than quitting DURING school, and since I didn't want to go over 10 years as a smoker, quitting before sounded better. "
That’s exactly what my wife did three years ago! We went to the nose of Iowa and hiked. She had her last cigarette when we got there and never turned back.
Quitting smoking is not that hard. I’ve done it five times this year alone
"Reminds me of the last time I've smoked a long time ago, damn it feels like an eternity since this morning."
"That's part of it for me: Set realistic goals. Nothing is more depressing than failing yourself over and over again. Nothing makes you need a smoke more than after you've failed to quit. Some people can quit cold turkey, some can't. I try to make it like a game, and now I smoke 1-2 cigarettes a day, and only at work. That's a level of smoking I can work with until I'm ready to fully jump off. But once you can forgive yourself, it becomes less crippling. "
Exactly. I quit about 30 minutes ago and will probably quit again later on today. 
I quit this morning and then again about 8 minutes ago. Feel like I’ve got a few more in me today before I quit again tomorrow 
I've quit every Monday for the last four months.  Those Friday night drinks get me every weekend.  
You just need to quit smoking one more time than you quit quitting.

"Pffff amateur, already did it 7x19 times this week."
I quit every weekend.
"Stopping entirely just means quitting enough times that you spend more time smoke free than not. Not everyone quits cold turkey, and if you quit 5 times this year and 7 next year, you'll have made progress.

Someone can quit 18 times a year, and that doesn't make them a failure, it just means they haven't hit the attempt that'll be successful yet. The more you try, the more chances you have to succeed."
Pretty sure you’re still smoking. 
Those are rookie numbers... I've quit at least 15 times today alone. 
I can quit anytime I want... I just dont want to
"This is funny but was also the key for me to actually quit.  I just kept on quitting until it stuck.  I tried every nicotine replacement product known to man, as well as cold turkey but wasn't successful, until what felt like my 100th attempt."
"I probably quit 14 times ""I'm done I'm never going to have another fucking cigarette again!"" before I finally quit for good. "
"Are you mi dad?

Because he says exactly that. He's quit smoking permanently and forever six times. "
youre not a genius are u

How long did you smoke for?
"Yup, this. Made it really easy. Tobacco free since 2009"
"Dont quit. Seriously. Start **not**  smoking. That way each day is an achievement, not a sacrifice. You focus on what you gain, not what you gave up. "
I smoked for 8 years and used chewing tobacco for 6 and this is the best advice here. Chewing gum and weening off won’t help if you can’t do this. I was in the best shape of my life when I smoked but I feel a hell of a lot better now that I’ve started to not smoke.  I haven’t touched a cigarette or dip in 4 years and I’ll never go back. I’ve even started to smoke cigars every now and then without a problem of quitting or anything. It is 100% a mental state.
Smoke-free for 2 days now. I really like this way of looking at it. Thanks.
"You have to fucking endure it and realise that by quitting you are quite literally saving your own life. This shit will kill you and it will hurt the entire time you're dying. You need to just fucking stick with it, replace the cravings and endure that shit like you're playing a game of dark souls. Only you have to win, because if you fuck up, you'll die. "
"Enduring is the key, people will always be looking for the magical solution but it's really just down to how long you can not use mental gymnastics to justify smoking again. 

It has to be hard to be worth it and if you're not struggling like a fish out of water then it's not working. (imo) "
"The thing, enduring is hard. So fucking hard. I quit smoking for four years. I thought the urge would fade away. It did not.

Every day, for four years, I wanted to smoke. I'm back on a pack a day right now. I now quitting would be what's best for me, but I don't want to feel that need everyday again."
"This is the only real advice, go about it however you need to, but you’re literally saving your own life. It’s not a matter of if, but when."
"Amen brother, amen."
"Watching my wife’s grandpa die from lung cancer got me to quit. My wife was pregnant with our first kid so she had already quit. 

Any time I would have any cravings for a smoke I would think how he didn’t get to meet my daughter and if not smoking allows me to see my great grandchildren, then I can live without the cigarettes. "
"This blows my mind. I literally quit with Dark Souls 2. Proof [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/32vurf/a_story_and_a_showing_of_thanks/). Followup proof [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/495zw1/dark_souls_2_and_quitting_smoking/). I almost caved a week ago, but, praise the sun I'm still over three and a half years strong."
How many people am I allowed to kill while I detox?
My heart attack and subsequent bypass surgery aged 42 helped me quit.
"My wife had a heart attack and died two weeks later. She was in a coma the whole time.
I quit the day after she got taken into the ICU. I've promised our kids I'd never smoke again.
Eight months and counting."

Dude... How are you now?
"The ebook by Aaron Carr that is pushed hard by /r/stopsmoking cost less than cigarettes and helped me quit ""cold turkey"" and within hours...I didn't even finish the book but quit completely in 2013

Edit- Allen Carr is the author's name...the book's title is The Easy Way to Quit Smoking"
[deleted]
[deleted]
"> Alan Carr

Can I get a tl;dr on his book/method and why is seems to be so effective? "
I see this a lot. What's in this book that's so fucking magical?
"So much this. Smoked for 15 years, more than a pack a day and stopped over night just over 4 years ago. 

Won't recommend to any ex-smoker, but that book even enabled me to be a ""party smoker"" - I can smoke half a pack on a metal gig getting drunk, and have no desire to smoke again the next day. I do this about once every 2-3 months and am amazed I never fall back...  YMMV"
"That book that is so good at getting you to quit, you can't even finish reading it."
"The Easy Way to Stop Smoking is actually the name of the book.  It is fantastic and worked for me too.  It puts you in the proper mindset.  Quitting gives the connotation that you are sacrificing something good when clearly you are not, a key point in the book!"
"This book was great for me, I recommend it to anybody who wants to quit."
"Quit smoking a few months ago thanks to The Easy Way to Quit Smoking. Smoked for nearly 10 years, always wanted to quit but never succeeded until I read the book. Do it."
"Same here, but the video.

Edit: sorry mates, I have no link for the video. It’s probably been 6 years since I’ve seen it.  Tried looking for it on YT but I couldn’t see it."
"I've heard this from so many people. They read the book in one sitting and never lit another cigarette. I wish there was a book that would do the same for procrastination, overeating, anxiety..."
Is it Allen or Aaron? Can’t seem to find Aaron Carr. 
"Thank you for this. I just ordered a used copy on eBay. This will be attempt number 3 for me. My grandmother quit when she was in her 40's and my mother who is 57 just quit because of bronchitis and hasn't smoked in almost a month. I've seen the effects of long term smoking and I don't want that, plus I have a 3 year old daughter and my girlfriend has daughter's as well. I'm going to try this book, and anything else I can find to stop, permanently."
"I read this book to and I feel it helped me quit. I read it a couple of more times whenever I started smoking again, and I really think it helped to quit, but I never felt disheartened because I'd stated again. I knew quitting again would be a choir but I still had that book. "
Same here! 
"So, I read that book in an attempt to find some angle of attack to get my dad to quit, but the book just basically says to think of yourself as a nonsmoker and just do nonsmoker things.  Other than that, it's just a motivational book with stories about the author who quit smoking and why his life is better without it.

Am I missing the point because I've never smoked and therefore never understood the addiction?"
worked for me too - smokefree since 2011
"Yup, that story he tells about making a boat turn back because he forgot his smokes but then not smoking any out of shame really hit me. "
"I have to add my voice to the choir recommending this book. It really works. It manages it take away almost every excuse you can think of to keep yourself smoking.

Years ago I decided to quit. I'd gone several days without smoking nearly at all but I kept having a late night smoke that ""didn't count if I didn't inhale"". After a few days of feeling like a failure I googled a bit and bought the ebook that night. It was the first night I went without smoking which turned into the first full day, and so on and so forth. I kept reading until my understanding of the addiction shifted to the point that I truly knew that I never wanted or needed to smoke again. I don't even think I finished the book either. 

I bought a hard copy soon thereafter because I wanted to pass this along. My husband quit shortly after me using a combo of the book and the patch. We then gave the book to my parents. with the acknowledgement that we didn't expect them to quit. That it had to be on their terms. But if they ever thought they were ready, to read the book in case it could help them too. 

Within the next year my mom and dad had both quit. They were lifelong smokers with 40+ years of experience who had tried quitting many times before and this book managed to help them where so many other methods failed. 

It's been 7 years now and I think my mom is still alive solely because she quit. That book saved her life. Now my mom still says she quit just so she could stop reading the damn book. I don't care. I'm just glad she's here to do the complaining."
"This needs to be up at the top. This is a proven method which is not only piss easy, it does not require any gimmicks. No chewing gum endlessly, sunflower seeds, no need for nicotine replacement therapy etc. I understand people being sceptical, I am the biggest sceptic out there but after reading this book, it changed my life forever. I won't lie to you, I have smoked after reading the book and quitting. The trigger for this was alcohol which you should steer clear from for the first few months ideally but nonetheless thanks to the book when the inevitable cravings do come I don't give in and buy a pack, I understand them for what they are and ignore them, happy to be a non smoker. That's the power of this book, cannot recommend enough"
What is it about the book that can cause so many to stop smoking? Is it a nicotine-laced book?
Read the book but for some reason it was the audiobook that made me really quit. It’s on audible.
"I recommend this to every one that is trying to quit or mentions wanting to.  It'll be a year  for me in a few weeks.  

It works amazingly well, only stipulation is you have to go into it already wanting to quit.  Someone suggested it to me many years ago and I only read it out of curiosity.  It motivated me to give it a shot but just didn't give enough effort.  The important thing though was it planted the seed.  I knew that when I was really ready to quit I'd go back to the book.  Sure enough when the time came that I made up my mind and that was it; went back, read it again, and never looked back.  Cold turkey"
"When you decide you’re going to buy your last pack, find a mason jar to put all those cigarette butts out in. Then when your pack is empty and the jar is full of cigarette butts and ash, fill it with water just enough so they’re all submerged. 

Anytime you want a cigarette, take that jar and shake it to get it all mixed up then open it and take a deep ass whiff.


You’ll quit in no time. "
"If you still have cravings after taking the big whiff, then take a little sip also."
Well that's thinking outside the box lol. I like it.
"Eh, that's pretty much what my whole apartment smelled like. Glad it worked for you though."
"Honestly - Cold Turkey. Bite the bullet, suffer for the week and you will be good.  
I quit almost 3 months ago, had last cig Sunday night, threw papers and filter in the bin and that was it. It was hard, fucking hard but get past 3 - 4 days and you will be good"
"This is what I did, over 5 years ago now. I wanted to stop because I'd just had a cold with a very sore throat and smoking was hell and made me feel worse. I'd recently read that the worst bit was the first 3 - 4 days and I felt I could power through that.

Not only did I manage to power through those few days (it was 4 for me) but afterwards it got so much easier. At that point it was more about breaking the habit rather than the pysical withdrawal. Maybe I'm lucky but I didn't get any urge to smoke after the first couple of weeks when I was used to not lighting up any more."
"For me, I was telling myself I’d quit every time I bought a pack for about a month, and one day after buying a pack I mustered up the courage to smoke a couple, then break the rest of my pack in half and throw them away. Haven’t touched one since. "
Same here. Cold turkey and stayed away from triggers for a month. That was eight years ago and haven't touched one again. Did have a few nightmares where I woke up in a sweat thinking I had relapsed.
"I told myself a year in advance that I was gonna quit smoking. That way I had an entire year to mentally prepare for it. Idk if this is actually a good tip or not but it worked perfectly for me. Haven’t touched a cigarette since December 31, 2017."
"Just take a week off work when you do it. No need to lose your job over being an asshole while you're working on it. Best decision of my life. Also get a tracker to keep count of money saved, time saved, cigarettes smoked etc. I use Cessation Nation to this day. "
"I quit five months ago, the day I graduated college, and haven't looked back, other than for the first week."
"The first time I quit, for 5 months, I was driving and just compulsively threw my half pack of cigarettes out the window. 

Looking back I wish I didnt litter, though."
I actually found it more difficult the second week after quitting. The first week you are still motivated. The second week is when you are creating a new routine and your entire body is fucked up. After week 2 was so much better. 
"Chantix did it for me. Felt like cheating, but I couldn't have done it without the stuff."
"There’s no such thing as cheating when it comes to quitting.  

Fight as dirty as you can.  "
I'm currently on chantix now. I'm 5 days smoke free and going strong. 
I used Chantix too. It gave me crazy nightmares though
"This. Started taking it and, one day, just didn’t really have the craving. It was pretty amazing. Make sure you finish the cycle (it’s like eight weeks or something). 
Chewed a fair amount of gum for another few months after. "
I did this as well and I highly recommend it. Took the pain out of quitting and made it easy. I tried quitting so many times only to eventually fail. Tried campix once and have been smoke free for 5 years\~ now. I also liked the vivid dreams. 
"Chantix was how my husband and I both quit. I quit within 2 weeks, and my husband within 30 days. "
"I had used patches, tried cold turkey, but kept going back to smoking.
Got rx for chantix from my Dr.  Had an event coming up where I knew the urge to smoke was gonna be really high, so delayed the start of taking the chantix till after that event.
After a few weeks I got up one morning, went to have my morning smoke, took one drag and realized it tasted really bad!  Tossed it and have not light up since.  That was around 10 years ago."
"Same.  Taking chantix took my craving-thoughts from ""fuck it you've smoked for so long you're gonna get cancer anyway might as well enjoy yourself"" to ""well I sure would like one but I shouldn't"".  

Once the cravings got to that level my sincere desire to quit and significantly changing my routine so I could develop new habits that didn't involve smoking got me over the finish line.

Granted this was 3 months ago, and I still occasionally slip up and have a couple, but I haven't had a smoke in the morning, while at work, etc, in that whole time."
"Chantix is fucking amazing and this should really have more upvotes. I took chantix and just kept smoking like normal until one day I was just like, I don't want this. A few weeks later I was like ""damn I really want a cigarette"" so I went out and bought a pack, took two puffs off that first cigarette and was like ""nope, I actually don't want this"".  

I did eventually start smoking again much later on and was too lazy/embarrassed to ask for Chantix from my doctor. So I switched to vaping. My wife wants me to quit that too though, so I finally went and got Chantix again. The really odd thing is it didn't help me with vaping at all. Was so surprising. I still vape, but no cigarettes at least?"
Okay so I’ve heard great things about Chantix and not so great things. The great thing is that it actually takes away the urge to smoke. The not so great thing- crazy night terrors that seriously fuck with you. Did you experience any of that?

Chantic made me not want to smoke but also turned me batshit crazy
"I took Chantix and read the book recommended above (Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr). Chantix helped me through the first week or so (after the first week where you continue smoking while taking Chantix). Anyone thinking about using it, make sure you follow the instructions and eat regular meals. At that time I would usually only eat once a day (midday) and my stomach would be killing me around midnight until I ate something. Like actual pain, not ""hunger pains"" or feeling sick or something. 

I tried quitting with Chantix twice and had the same issue both times, so I know that was the culprit for sure. Second time I stopped taking the Chantix and used the motivation I gained from the book to finish quitting. Been 7.5 years now. "
Welbutrin for me.
Chantix is the only thing that worked for me. I tried many methods and failed repeatedly. I've even had to do chantix multiple times but I feel confident I'm finally done. 
"I'm 8 months smoke free because of Chantix.
I didn't set a ""quit"" date, it just became obvious that the cigarettes tasted like shit and didn't give me the same fix anymore.  I actually did not want them anymore.

I do believe that it pushed me into a bit of a depression, however, I had just started it a week before my mother passed, and then another series of fairly negative things happened, so I can't totally blame the Chantix.  I will say that there were a few nights around week 4 or so that I was just ridiculously angry that I COULDNT get a nicotine fix - smoking wouldnt give me any relief.  I learned that in the first week, though.

I've been off Chantix awhile now, and I get urges to smoke, sometimes - interestingly it isnt after meals like before, its when Im really angry.  But its easy to just ignore the urge, I mean, hell, Ive come this far.  I'm 100% certain I'm done."
"It helped me too. I'd already tried quitting cold turkey a few years before, and made it a few months before stupidly starting again.

Comparing cold turkey to Chantix, I'd say Chantix was like skipping the first 2 or 3 weeks of withdrawal symptoms.  Skipping the most intense part of it, but I still did *kinda* want to smoke sometimes, though I think that was just the psychological part at that point. But it was much easier to deal with the mental aspect having Chantix take the edge off the physical aspect.

I was lucky enough not to experience any side effects, at least not noticeably worse than the effects of quitting cold turkey."
I used champax which o assume is the same thing.  Absolute miracle drug.  I'd still be smoking now only for it.  3 years now. 
"Vape. But not in an obnoxious ""force other people to walk through vanilla, banana, sundae vapour""shit. Use it to have that hand to mouth action that is habitual. 

"
"I quit cold turkey because I found out I was pregnant, but my husband quit this way. Just the habit of going outside was hard to break. So he would vape and I would eat one of those little dum-dum suckers. Been smoke free for 6 straight years now."
I'd rather walk through banana than tobacco smoke 
"Agree, the Juul specifically is all that worked for me. Working on quitting that now."
"I quit last year with the help of a new gaping rig! Get your hardware online but go to a shop for the juice, because everyone makes it slightly different and most places will let you try before you buy!

E: I'm leaving it. "
"I bought a disposable e-cig today. I really have found I don’t really crave nicotine, it’s the act of smoking that’s a habit. I had planned to buy a rechargeable e-cig and a couple of weeks worth of juice but now I’m optimistic that a week or so on the disposables might be enough to break the habit. "
"In all honesty it is the nicotine dosage you are use to. Vapes/e-cigarettes let you control your dosage and you can decrease it gradually over time. Then when your down to 3mg or less, you start seeing less of a dependence on it. Eventually I just stopped all together within a year. Still vape during the cold months though, vape and coffee in the morning (used to be cig and coffee). Honestly it changed everything. "
"This. Keep your wattage low on a stock piece of kit so you don't look like fog rolling in off the ocean.

Black Friday will mark two years since my last smoke and 1 year since I stopped vaping. Picking a non tobacco flavor helped though as tobacco vape just tasted like nasty cheap cigarettes and made me want the real thing even more."
"Cigarettes have a ton of chemicals that your body becomes dependent on, quitting nicotine is like quitting coffee, you’re gonna be aggravated and have cravings but it’s manageable. Vape on the other hand is pretty much 4 ingredients, the only addictive one is nicotine, the transition from cigs to vape isn’t as difficult as quitting cold turkey but it’s a different sensation and you still crave the cigs. But if you can switch to vape it’s easier to quit, you can change your dosage down and do it at your own pace and it won’t hurt your health as bad."
"Yep, I was half pack a day for almost a decade. The trick if you really want vaping to stick is to go heavy dose and a good system for the start. It'll get you hooked harder on the vape for a while, but it's much easier to come down with weaker and weaker doses. Less than 2 years later, I'm still always carrying it around, but it's mixed at a very low 1.5mg nicotine, and I'm basically just working on kicking the routine now. Smoking after eating, during breaks, and while driving were always huge triggers, and that's hard to overcome. "
"Honestly this. I had no interest in quitting for the longest time until my friend started vaping and let me try some of his. Haven't even had the urge to pick up a cig since because the vape gives me the same satisfaction of hand to mouth like you said. 

Two months smoke-free, and not once has it ever felt like a battle. To anyone looking to quit I can't recommend it enough. "
"As a transition for smokers who lack resolve, a decent setup is the alternative to tobacco.

For the cold Turkey types that hit a wall, A cheap disposable can get some over the hump."
The Juul has helped me alot just with just going through the motions 
"Yup. Helped me out this year tremendously. Got to the point where I even grew tired of vaping. However, when I drink I now like to indulge in vaping (as opposed to ciggarettes). But it truly did help."
Yup. My wife got pregnant and she quit immediately. I vaped for a few months then quit that too.
"Particularly I found it easier to quit by slowly reducing the amount of nicotine in vape juice. After reducing to zero nicotine (over the course of like two years), I slowly stopped craving the action and eventually stopped carrying it around. It’s been over three years since then, and I don’t even get tempted by cigarettes, vapes, or nicotine at all anymore. 

Also by working down the amount of nicotine, your body becomes more sensitive to smaller amounts. So when I did try a cigarette after quitting, it was so overwhelming, it made me sick and not want to finish it. "
This is how I quit. I was able to gradually reduce the nicotine level of the fluid and also reduce the frequency since I could just take a few hits when the urge came on but not have to smoke an entire cigarette. Eventually I reduced both the nicotine craving and the habit craving enough to be able to quite. Took me about 6 months.
"This. Started this after two years of two packs a week and while it does cost more upfront, you do save money front less frequent trips to buy juices or coils. "
"Same. I just wanted to quit cigarettes, but the nicotine addiction itself isn't such an issue to me. I just use the small pen-like e-cigarettes with a menthol liquid (I don't like all the flavoured stuff) and it doesn't produce much steam or a scent. People sometimes comment that it smells quite nice, if anything.

I might deal with the nicotine addiction itself someday by weaning myself down to weaker liquids. But for now I'm happy with the vaping, I enjoy it and it has completely replaced smoking for me. I couldn't smoke a real cigarette anymore, they smell awful to me now.

I do remember when I made the switch from cigarettes to vaping that there was an immediate change in how I felt. I stopped coughing, I felt more energetic, things tasted better, my fingernails went from blue to a nice healthy pink... whatever vaping is for me, it's a *hell* of a lot healthier than smoking cigarettes and for now, I'm happy with that. "
"I did it this way. I got the vape oils where you could gradually reduce the amount of nicotine. Started with two weeks at a low mg lvl, then the next two weeks with the lowest possible option. After that, only oils with no nicotine. Used it often and I would usually pull it out before I thought cravings would come. Kinda worked to keep my mind off it and I would eventually realize I made another day without feeling too bad. 

After about 6 weeks I realized the thing was nothing more than a pacifier and I put in a drawer. Been 7 years. 
"
"The real fight doesn't begin until you are off nicotine completely. No chew, no gum, no patches, no vaping. All of them are better than smoking, so there is that ,but don't kid yourself nicotine is still your master. Source: I smoked 2 or more packs a day for about 40 years. Quit a hundred times. Currently nicotine free for 1.5 years. Still want 'em."
[deleted]
"Don't, it's not proven, but probably also very unhealthy. Just get over your urge to suck on things, you're not a baby anymore."
"I went and saw a hypnotist. He also is an MD and a Chiropractor as well with a long history of practice in his medical profession.

One session, walked out, never looked back.  No withdrawals, anger issues etc that I had felt with on previous attempts to quit.

About a year later, smoked a cigarette with a friend, wanted to see if I would pick the habit back up, never had the urge to pick up the habit.

Been 4 years now.  

The Docs perspective is that cigarettes are a coping mechanism, not a physical addiction, but a psychological one. 

Myself and now about 7 people I have recommended to go, all cigarette free.  He found something that seems to work well.


"
Ok were you from and how can I find one?
"I mean, nicotine is quite literally one of the most addictive substances we can use. that doesnt negate the power of psychologically deciding to stop and believing you can do it-- that shit is just as powerful to us :)"
"My parents smoked since before I was born, and a couple years ago they found out about some hypnotist who sells DVDs to quit smoking. They watched them and haven't had a cigarette since. Pretty wild."
I find it hard to believe that an MD is also a chiropractor... 
Yeah I have my doubts about his being an MD and chiropractor... 
But hows the sunken place?
"I smoked half a cigar the othet day, and the high I got from it was akin to the feeling I get after finishing exercises for two hours. It's so intoxicating and scary that you could sink so easily."
Currently cutting down and managed to get down to 2 - 3 per day. Using a vape to help with this. Current motivation is saving money for Christmas so hope I can stick at it! 
"Try to avoid caffeine as much as possible, in the morning I would have an apple to wake me up using the natural sugar. Something to have a hand/mouth interaction helped as well, I bought a non-nicotine based e-cigarette with a light up tip just for that more realistic look to my brain. Lastly I used some basic 3-step nicotine patches. Hope these points help out, good luck with Christmas. "
"Using a vape definitely helped me as well. Smoked a pack a day, went down to 1 or 2 a day and eventually just quit smoking."
You’re doing great! I quit in 1984 (yes I am old). Life after cigs is much better. I have no helpful tips other than willpower. I just decided to quit and I did. It is something I had wanted to do for awhile. You got this!
"I’m right where you are. Vape and using an app to slowly cut down. Currently on 3 a day. My motivation is coming from how much quicker my skin is healing. I open boxes all day so the skin around my nails was always fucked up. I now have cuticles again! I know it's small, but having visual proof that my health is getting better is giving me a kick up the arse to keep going."
"Best of luck to you! I will say this, from my personal experience I wouldn't try ""cutting back"" or ""weaning off"". I tried this the first time and it was hell. It's like slowly torturing yourself and it lifts up the cigs/vape you do smoke on a pedestal.  
  
Second time I quit cold turkey and haven't looked back (been ~2 years). Honestly 72 hours is all it really takes for the worst of it to be over, so remove all smoking accessories (ashtrays, lighters, etc) and just try to keep yourself busy with something you enjoy. It varies obviously from person to person but for me day 1 wasn't bad, just cravings. Day 2 was tough, irritable, couldn't sleep well, etc. Day 3 things started to smooth out and by day 4 I felt less irritable, was able to sleep normal, and only had cravings when I performed tasks I normally smoked afterwards.    
  
The most surprising thing to me was the week AFTER I quit my appetite suddenly shot through the roof! Seriously I always felt hungry and ended up snacking almost non-stop during the day. So ya, you may gain a few pounds if that happens to you too but even that goes away after about a month or 2.  "
"I'm completely on vape myself, but now I'm just addicted to that instead.  

I can't recommend enough asking your doctor about Chantix. It worked wonders. The quitting process was actually effortless. I just didn't want them anymore. Simple as that.  

Only reason I vape still is because Chantix seems to have no effect on it with me, which is unfortunate. Worked great though with cigarette smoking."
"I did that for a long time.  This sounds a little out there, but in order to really quit I had to make peace with the fact that I can never have another cigarette.  In unsuccessful attempts, I had it in the back of my mind that I could have 1 or 2 a day, or on special occasions.  The truth is that I'll be right back where I started if I did that.
"
"Sorry to say, but all it takes is discipline and resolve. The way it worked for me was that 1, I saw that my wife was feeling really nauseated. She wouldn't say anything, but I could see it in her face. I just had to stop hurting her. That, plus we were planning to start a family. Once those two things sunk in and I made my resolution, I never went back. I only tried to quit once, and that was it. Haven't smoked since 2004."
I went cold turkey after I started smelling my hands and realized I had to vigorously rinse with soap and water just to get that disgusting smell off me. I didn't want my hands or clothes to smell like an ash tray anymore.
Yep it's one of those things with no real trick other than to just do it.
"Yep, similar story here. It was easy, once I had a reason to."
"My friend (male) had a child and he just stopped smoking one day and never did it again.  I'm not sure how he did it, but he doesn't talk about it.  It was a really weird thing - I was so used to him going outside for smokes and such.  

I would probably smoke, but nicotine always gives me an 'impending doom' feeling for some reason.  Unless I'm on amphetamines, then it feels really nice to smoke - like water to a thirsty man."
This is how I quit as well. Just stopped buying cigarettes and haven’t gone back. Yes it sucks and yes sometimes I want to smoke but knowing I just could but make the choice not to keeps me going. 
"Similar here. Had a kid, switched to vaping for 3 months, then just quit."
"Same thing here, i had tried and failed several times, then we got engaged and I had this horribly vivid day dream of getting emphysema or COPD or lung cancer and becoming a burden on her financially and physically (not to mention the emotional burden of seeing a loved one die slowly). I had to stop going out with our friends for a couple of months, after that saying no was really easy (without alcohol or the social pressure of my friends smoking--both my big triggers).  The cravings never truly disappear, but they diminish in intensity and frequency until not smoking is easier than giving in."
"You say ""all it takes is discipline and resolve"" but then go right into the powerful emotional reasons that motivated you to quit. I think the second part is what it really takes."
"Come on mate it’s not that hard, I’ve quit 4 times this morning"
"Understanding that the urge to smoke isn't an urge to feel relief. It's anxiety induced from the habit. Once you fundamentally understand that cigarettes aren't ""calming your nerves"" they're the reason for you feeling restless in the first place it helps you resist the urge to feed that nicotine bug. "
"I quit because I got more and more concerned about my skin/looks aging as I got older. At the time I had no problem smoking because, in my mind, I was young and able to 'spring back' from anything I did to my body, but being in my 20s and having the vaguest suggestion of wrinkles totally changed my tone and convinced me to make some changes in my life before it's too late. Sucks because I love cigarettes but it wasn't that hard to quit, it feels like another part of a beauty regimen."
This too for me.  I didn't want to get smokers lips.  Yikes.  
Same here! Every time I see someone older smoking I look at their skin... always slightly grayish and sallow looking.  And smokers lips are the worst!
"okay so i'm 4 days in with no cigarette, i've tried to quit twice before and this is the longest i've gone. i've found the only time it will work is if you seriously want to quit yourself, not from people pressuring you. smoke what you've got left by rationing it out for the next few days, don't buy any more and go cold turkey once they're gone. i'm vaping through this, helps a lot. also for nicotine cravings, i learnt that we're not addicted to nicotine as such but to endorphin release. i'm putting time into things i enjoy like painting, CONSIDERING exercising at the moment. this should give you some endorphins to keep you happy! "
Good luck! Keep at it. I had the hardest time quitting. I smoked for 20+ years. What worked for me was the patch. I used the Step 2 one and it helped so much with the cravings.  The vape helped with the habit
Yeah so every time I wanted one after work I would go down to the gym or go for a run. it SUCKED and I fuckin hated it but I sure as shit didn't want one after working out
"Hey man, great job. Just in case you aren't aware, it only gets easier past day 4. Days 3 and 4 are often the worst. That's not to say days 5, 6, and 7 are easy, but they're often easier than days 3 and 4. You're almost over that hill!"
"I am also four days in, maybe 5. Let's help one another. I am going to PM you, if that's OK. "
"My mom used to smoke a lot. she was only able to quit because she got very sick, and couldnt breathe if she inhaled smoke. After she got better about 2 weeks later she just didnt start again.

it might not work for everybody, but if theres a reason you might be unable to smoke for a while, just try not to start again."
"This happened to me a little over three weeks ago.  Couldn't breathe so couldn't smoke.  Four days passed and I decided to not smoke any more when I could breathe again.  Rituals, routines are the hardest part.  I chew on coffee stirrer straws and vape at 3 mg after eating for a few minutes."
"Don’t smoke a cigarette today, just get through the day without one. Then tomorrow do the same thing, just get though the day without one. Small little attainable goals working toward a larger long term goal is an easy way to break it down. I don’t even remember when I quit because that day doesn’t matter, only today."
You have to want to.  
"A million times this.

If you’re not doing it for yourself, you’re not going to follow through."
"We quit using Chantix. The side effects can be tough; thankfully we didn't really experience anything bad except for mild depression. 

It was really like flipping a switch. At our doctors advise, we smoked for the first 14 days (instead of 'just' 10). After our last cigarette, we destroyed what we had left and never looked back. I didn't expect it to be that easy. We've been smoke free since 2012. 

Edit: We = My husband and I. I couldn't have quit alone :) "
"Worked for me too! A combination of the medication & going on holiday with a non-smoker during the last part of the treatment course (ie. no longer smoking but still taking the tablets). I’ve never looked back. 

You just have to get to the point where they stink if you smell someone smoking. Then you’re on the home run!"
">we smoked for the first 14 days (instead of 'just' 10).  

Might not work for everyone, but I just completely ignored that part of the book and kept smoking without trying to quit. Sure enough somewhere around day 14 or so I just wasn't smoking anymore. Didn't want it. About a week or so after that I got a craving, broke down and bought a pack. Took two puffs off one cigarette and was like ""nope, that's not what I wasn't at all"".
"
We? Are you schizophrenic?
"The way I see it, *we* can do whatever *we* want. We are Venom."
Stop hanging around smokers
This is what helped me. Took a break from drinking for a few months too.
I took about 2 weeks away from my group of friends that smoke. It really does help.
Solid advice.
Great idea unless you work in a bar....
"Use e-cig for transition. Here is how I do when I was burning through roughly 2 packs a weeks at the time, and been smoking for 12 years give or take. I cut half cigarette intake and pick up the strongest e-juice. After a few weeks, I will keep cutting cigarette intake. I will cut until I'm completely off then I will start cutting on e-juice nicotine level. Then I quit e-cig for good. The whole process took me about a year and a half.
 




"
"Once I SERIOUSLY made up my mind, EVERY time I  craved I told myself ""$10 a day,  $10 a day, $10 a day"". Something to keep me motivated is simply be within smelling distance of someone who smokes. "
"That’s been the biggest motivator for me and just about the only reason I quit, according to my tracker I quit smoking 678.97 dollars ago and it feels amazing. "
"After 26 years of smoking and countless efforts I'm off smoking for a year now.  

The things that worked for me: quitting on vacation, every soft moment I had I went on doing something active that got my mind on something else (videogames, sport/running). I used CBD oil (without THC) once every 2 days to help me sleep better through the first 2 weeks. Honestly, I hardly had any difficulty quitting...  

Good luck man!"
Another vote for Chantix.  Take your second pill of the day in the early evening instead of later to avoid the weird dreams.
"I never got the weird dreams like some people say. When I tried the patch there were def weird crazy vivid dreams, but never with Chantix. So long as they're not bad dreams, it can fun."
I've been thinking of getting this. Do you remember how much it costs?
"Take a tab of LSD, smoke cigarette, be disgusted. Quit. At least that's how it happened to me. "
I love smoking on lsd :(
"When you are tripping and your holding that cigarette really start asking yourself “what am I actually doing with this thing and what is it doing to me” a million thoughts, ideas and feelings racing through your head before the cigarette is even out. This will definitely change anyone’s perspective on smoking and will no doubt allow a lot of people to quit easily. "
Lol i like this idea. Now where can i buy some of that LSD medication?
"You have to want to quit. Because you want to, not because you know you should. They're very different. When you want to, you do. I decided one night after 15 years chewing tobacco that planning to quit was stupid. I  decided that ""after this <can / pack / week / month > I'll quit"" was a completely unnecessary delay. Almost at random one Sunday, I just stopped. That was 2012.


A staggering number of people can't quit because they just don't want to. They know they should, because it's logical, so they try and try. When you decide that you *want* to quit, there's no need for any distraction or intervention. You just quit. 


I'll be upvoted by cold turkey quitters and downvoted by people who think they're ready but keep failing and don't want to admit to themselves that they really don't want to quit at all."
This was my experience as well. A switch got flipped and I threw out the rest of my pack and never looked back.
"This is 100% true. I was in welding school and everyone around me smoked. My vape was quickly forgotten as I jumped on the bandwagon for 8 months. Then as soon as I was out of school, I was the only one that smelled bad and I didn’t want to do it anymore. Now back on the vape and I haven’t touched a cig since. 

It is, most definitely, wanting to do it. 

Don’t be afraid to admit that you’re not ready to quit yet. It’ll make you realize sooner when you do actually want to quit. "
"You’re right. I was kind of (??) a cold turkey quitter. Kinda not. But ultimately, you need to want to quit. I wanted to because I couldn’t breathe normally and I felt my heart doing weird stuff. "
"With Chantix you can quit even if you don't truly want to. Or at least some people can anyway. For me it completely eliminated the desire for them. At one point I had a fond memory/craving, broke down and bought a pack. Took two puffs and it was gross and did nothing for me.  

Cold Turkey advocates can knock it if they want, but not everyone is in a place where they truly want to quit, but know they should. If Chantix can help them be a healthier person and their doctor says it's good, why not?  "
"Don't say to yourself ""I'm giving up smoking"", say ""I don't smoke anymore"". Makes cold turkey much easier. Good luck! It's possible :)"
"I'd go a bit further, and say don't quit at all. What I mean is, I packed in in July 2007. But I didn't really - I'm simply a non-practising smoker to this day. I can have a smoke if I want, but I choose not to. It's hard to explain, but after years of trying to give up, this worked. The thought of never smoking again, ever, can be quite overwhelming at first, and you can resent it. It also helps if you end up scavving a ciggie off a mate when drunk - you don't beat yourself up about it, because it's OK - you're still a smoker anyway. Worked for me, anyway, along with patches for the first week or so to get over the physical side of it. Reckon I was in the clear after a month or so, but the old saying about getting urges on the threes (3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months) seemed oddly true."
"I disagree. A friend quit smoking by playing a Jedi mind trick on himself. Every time he lit up a cigarette, didn’t matter if he was alone or in a crowd of 1,000 people, he would say, out loud, “I am a non-smoker. I do not smoke,” as he was lighting it. At first you feel silly, and it just doesn’t sit right, because you know you’re lying to yourself. Eventually, it becomes a mantra you say to yourself to get through the next hour, or 15 minutes, or even the next minute if the craving is bad enough, until the craving inevitably passes. Worked for 30 years and counting for my friend, and 16 years and counting for me."
"That’s what did it for me.  I wasn’t quitting smoking, I just don’t smoke.  Just like I don’t do heroin or murder people.   It isn’t hard to not do those things because they are terrible and I don’t do them.  Just like smoking is terrible and I don’t do it.  Mindset is everything. "
"Day 3 is the hardest for the body, take that  the day off work or plan it on the weekend.

After a couple of weeks the physical craving will never again be as strong as the mental one.

Try to quit when life is at a ""normal"" or lower level of stress for you, stress is the hardest part of quitting if smoking is a crutch for you like out was for me.

Understand that the cravings will never really go away completely. They will get less powerful and less frequent but they will never be gone. Accept that now. A good friend of mine quit in his 30s and told me before he died in his late 80s that he still got cravings.

I was 1-4 packs a day for ~9 years. Been clean over 10 now. Discipline is the key, this is more about mental addiction than physical."
"4 packs a day??????

I can't even get 1 pack a day on my most stressful days, 3/4 pack makes me feel sick.  How smooth were your cigarettes?  "
Willingness and enough prior failed attempts to really want it. It's not easy but it can be done. Haven't had a smoke in 2 years and 8 months.
"I am only 8 weeks without one, so grain of salt etc. 

Motivation: I got married and my wife said ""it's not fair that you intentionally leave me alone at the end""

Techniques: 

understanding that every time you are having a smoke, you are making an active decision.

Mental framing is important. I am not giving up for example, because smoking provides no value so there is nothing to give up. I am stopping instead.

I gamify (sp?) it. Counting the days until my next achievement.

Count the days like you would in AA. 

Replacement. I use lozenges as they last for long enough for me to stop thinking about it, taste nice and hit the spot. 

Habit. There were times when I would get up to have a smoke because that is what I would do through habit. Even 15-20 days in. I would do something instead. Walk, press ups, video games for a while etc.

I was off work, which is not available to everyone. 

Effort. It was hard at first. Then it got easier. Now I am not willing to break my streak and start again. The habit has gone and the replacement works well. 

Don't stop at the first hurdle, you might not be quitting at day 1. You are just trying to set a high score. Keep going with that and you will make it further each time.

Good luck if you are going to go for it. I smoked heavily for 15 years and if I can do it (hopefully) then a high % of the smokers are up to it."
"For me it was one day at a time. Set short term goals to make the process more manageable. Recognize that the process will be hard and annoying. The first part is easy, willpower can take you far, and the physical addiction is over in a few days. The truely hard part is breaking the habit - it took me 2 months before I stopped thinking about cigs at every commercial break on the tv. Reward yourself with the money you save, eat whatever you want, your metabolism will change anyway - gaining some weight is worth it. Good luck."
"Smoke free since April 2001!

I grew up in a home where both parents smoked, I started smoking myself about 14 years old because... I'm stupid. 

By the time I quit in 2001 I was up to 30 a day, 40 if I went out drinking at night. I was getting my cigarettes illegally through a guy at work so they were roughly £25 a stick instead of £35-40,  Now I'm pretty damn sure these were counterfeit ones or at the very least cheaper versions for foreign markets.  I noticed a vast deterioration in my lungs and I became concerned. 

The easiest way to stop is wanting to stop for yourself, not for your partner, not because the doctors said so, but because YOU WANT TO!  

Back then Patches were new, bloody expensive and not available for free on the NHS,  I did the large patches and you had a chart to stick a little blue sticker on each day, I think the large patches lasted 20 days, then medium ones for the same and then I couldn't be arsed with he small ones so just stopped.

17 years later I still get weird urges once a blue moon for about 20 seconds that I really want one.  I don't mind people smoking around me, which was one of the thing I was most worried about once I decided to stop.  The first time I went out for a beer or two  I was so relieved because it didn't make me want one like I had imagined it would.  

I still enjoy beer to this day!"
"10 years listening to friends and family try to sway me to stop smoking. 'You should really stop smoking' blah blah blah. Ive ignored them every single time until recently I told myself ""I want to stop smoking"" realize that it's not going to happen unless you want the change for yourself. That's where it started for me. Good luck.

"
You have to do it for you. I tried to quit for someone else and I relapsed so much. 
"The nicotine patch took the edge off for me.  But I found the habit more difficult to break than the addiction.  I liked those moments in the day where I could take 5min for a smoke.  I just kept in mind that the longer I abstained, the less of a habit it would be, and that was true.  After a few weeks, it wasn't nearly as difficult."
"Hooray finally something I can answer. I smoked for 15 years and quit 11 months ago.

First, WANTING to quit is the key. That's step one in the mental battle.
Second, get some kind of nicotine aid at least in the first few weeks. That's to help the PHYSICAL battle. Personally I got patches. Use for as long as YOU need not as long as the pack says. I stopped after 2.5 weeks total because I felt I didn't need it anymore but we're all different.
Third, continue reminding yourself WHY you quit and how you've reached the goal and now it's about keeping it. Health, money, time, social etc.
Four, find something to do with the TIME. I realised how much time went to smoking and had to replace it with something else to avoid slipping. I drink a lot of water now by carrying a water bottle (good for the psychological habbit of bringing something to your mouth). Also eating a piece of fruits when getting the craving helped. Plenty of exercise was also key for me as health was part of my reason.

You CAN free yourselves from the shackles of tobacco, you CAN regain your health, money and time. Most importantly, you WILL thank yourselves for it.

Good luck!"
"I saw my aunt dying of cancer. I saw her on her deathbed. She wasn’t a smoker but cancer is a very likely ending for smokers. I saw her in pain and agony. She was out of it and hallucinating constantly. I saw her 12 hours before her death. 

I don’t want such an ending. Although nonsmokers can and do get cancer, I do not want to facilitate it or bring my death any closer. I do not want to be in that kind of pain. I know I will regret every drag at that point. I know I will feel as though I have betrayed my son since I won’t be able to join him in most of his life’s accomplishments. And for what? A nasty habit? Something that I can get rid of? 

The strength that it will take to quit will be much easier and short term than the pain and helplessness I will feel later if I don’t quit. 

So I quit. Just like that. Cold turkey. After 2 years, I started again. As I write this post, I quit again. For good. "
"Thats great, I'm so proud of you. Be strong!"
"When I started smoking I thought I'll never push my some time future baby around whilst smoking. Nearly 20 year later I changed jobs, smoking was becoming socially unacceptable, and took the opportunity of a new routine to cut back. Then started trying for a baby. I was ready, if you aren't mentally ready it must be really hard. A baby was my life long 'time to give up', I just didn't imagine I'd be smoking for 20 years. "
Worked well for me to have a buddy. A good friend and I quit in 2011 together. It was helpful to have someone to share the beginning stress and urges with. Neither one of us has touched a cigarette since!
"Came in to say this.  I quit at the same time as my brother.  I'm sure it depends on your personality, but for me having the extra incentive of ""if I cheat, I'm letting him down too"" probably kept me from relapsing."
"Disciplin and a workplace without breaks.
"
vape?
"Imo vaping is not the answer. You're merely changing the delivery device of nicotine. Sure it's ""healthier"" but what makes you think you NEED nicotine? Why not give it up? Vaping without nicotine is pointless"
"Fucking want it. 

If you don't want to quit, you won't. Don't matter if your kid or friend begs you to do it. You'll say the same shit every time. ""Eventually."" Or ""I will. Once this pack runs out."" Whatever the context, you have to WANT to do it."
"100%. My dad can't bring himself a tiniest bit of sympathy for kids stuck in an area with smoke. My grandma got lung cancer for this reason, still smokes. You gotta want it, it doesn't matter for literally any other factor. Nicotine is a monster."
"You have to be to the point where you are disgusted with it. If you try quitting but still enjoy smoking, it won’t work. "
This isn’t even close to being true. I loved smoking and would go right back to it if I wasn’t afraid of dying young.
"Not necessarily true. I loved smoking, but quit anyway."
do not buy them. adjust your route so you dont pass a point of sale etc. also helps with food. if you buy chips you will eat it if you dont buy it you doby consume it
It’s amazing how rarely I go into convenience store after quitting. Never need a quick stop at 7-11 again.
"Tried this with cold turkey quit attempt. Got rid of all cigarettes in the house and lighters. Worked for like the first couple days, then couldn't take it one night and walked through a bad blizzard to the nearest place that was still open which was pretty far."
"I ran out of money for a few weeks, I couldn't afford cigarettes so I stopped buying them.  I didnt really miss it that much."
"I used to smoke a lot during my high school/university days. Not as much as some people but a pack a day wasn’t out of the question sometimes. 

When I decided to cut down later it wasn’t a problem for me at all but analyzing the situation I can see a few factors that probably helped: 

- changing the routine and those around you. This isn’t as easy for everyone but I can tell that I want a smoke more if I’m in the company of people I used to have it with, or in similar situations. 
- don’t think this is forever. I can have a pack or two once or twice a year when we go traveling or something like this. And I think knowing this helps with not thinking about it too much. 
- do more sports. There is nothing I want less after a workout than a cigarette. 


From experience by relatives, those who smoked a lot for longer (10,20 years etc) will never really quit and be like before. So don’t try. Be ready to accept this truth and make it your goal to just do it less and less over time. "
My dad did as many situps as he could every time he had a craving. He said the association of the craving to the pain made the cravings go away. He might just be crazy.
Behavioral psychologists would not think him crazy
"I followed a famous philosopher: Do or do not, there is no try. "
"I switched to a vape. I started on 6Mg nic for a month or 2 then dropped to 3Mg. I could probably drop to a 0 but I've stuck with 3. I smoked between 1.5-2 packs a day when I quit, and at $10 for a pack of Marlboro menthols ($140+ a week), that was motivation enough to quit.

I pay $30 for 120Ml of juice that lasts me about a week, and I haven't smoked a cigarette in 2 or 3 years now. I'm at the point now where the smell of a cigarette makes me sick and gives me a headache. I'm not gonna lie, there are still times when I really crave a cigarette, like when I'm super stressed out, or I'm hanging out with smokers, at that point I remind myself of all the reasons I quit.

My grandfather also ended up with a tumor behind one of his ears, which the doctors informed him was a direct result of his smoking in the past, even though he quit decades ago. My grandmother also had a mass found in one of her lungs (They discovered it after my grandparents were in a car accident and she had x-rays done), she never smoked a day in her life, It was the second hand smoke that did it. Fortunately, they found the mass when it was relatively new, and were able to remove it before it had the chance to metastasize. This is the only time I've ever been grateful to hear somebody got into a car accident. "
Juul. 
"Smoked a pack a day from 16-27, haven’t smoked a single cigarette since, I just turned 40.

Cold fucking turkey. Don’t vape, don’t reduce, just quit nicotine and commit.

Don’t quit for a period of time, you just think about that cigarette you eventually get to have. Decide you aren’t smoking again, and when the craving hits you, put the thought out of your mind instead of wallowing in it.

After 2 weeks, it stops hurting and becomes an empty space like a missing tooth. After this it is much easier."
I discovered weed.
"I was smoking both, but I needed to stop smoking tobacco. I had tried quiting, but no one likes a quitter, so I just had to stop smoking. 

 I found some really cheap weed and rolled about 60 joints. Every time I wanted a cigarette, I would smoke a joint. The quality was low, and it wouldn't get me high, but it satisfied my need for something to smoke. 

My third day in, I no longer wanted to smoke cigarettes and I no longer wanted to smoke that shit weed. Over the next two weeks, any time I had a craving, I would smoke a joint. I stopped smoking for a good 2 years until I picked it up again during a night of drinking. 

I did the same thing after a year and stopped smoking for another year or so. The last time I stopped smoking, I used this method and a non nicotine vape for the times I feel like going back. 

It's been over seven years now and my lungs feel great, I no longer gag and hack out huge dark wads of mucus, and, weed & food taste a lot better! "
I have zero interest in ever drinking alcohol again after discovering weed
I used the patch and jolly ranchers for the oral fixation. Took a long time but worth it
I stopped about 8 years ago-> Nicotine patch and Altoids did it for me. Additional bonus-> The Nicotine patches gave me the most amazing dreams I've ever had. Nothing has come close since...
I never ever remember my dreams. But I *did* remember the vivid and grotesque nightmares patches gave me. Shits wild
"Tell yourself you're not quitting. You're just taking a break. The hardest part is facing your last cigarette and the fear of never having one again. Set a physical goal in the future exercise way and tell yourself when you accomplish this, you can smoke again. I say this because my lungs were hurting and if I was in shape enough to complete this long bike ride I wanted to do then my lungs would be better, right? Well, once that day comes, you'll probably not want to smoke a cigarette afterwards. "
"If you really want to quit then you’ll quit. I got fed up with being out of breath doing basic things like walking upstairs, I caught a cold and I had the worst cough of my life. I was coughing up black tar and i was in pain. So I quit cold turkey."
"Also one more note: don’t ever say “this is my last cigarette ever” while you’re smoking it, because that basically ensures it won’t be "
"I don’t necessarily agree with that. Eventually, the statement will be true. A friend of mine, in the process of quitting, would say, out loud, as he was lighting his cigarette, “I am a non-smoker. I do not smoke.” Didn’t matter if he was alone or in a room with 1,000 people, he said it, every time. At first you feel silly, and it just doesn’t sit right, because you know you’re basically lying to yourself. But eventually it becomes a mantra that you say to yourself to get you through the next hour, or 15 minutes, or even the next minute, until the craving passes, which it inevitably does. My friend has been smoke free for 30 years now, and it’s been 16 for me. The Jedi mind trick works."
What worked for me was not to get rid of them. I carried an unopened pack of cigarettes around for the better part of a year.  This calmed me because they were there if I needed them but I was choosing not to use them.  I know it sounds crazy but it worked for me.  It was kind of like I was beating them right in their own face.  I threw the pack away once I felt like I was over it.  I will be honest in that I have tried to smoke a few times since then but the taste of it makes me nauseous now.  I can't even kiss my husband when he has an occasional smoke when we are out drinking.  
"Start up weightlifting, commit 5 days a week and train until you reach your physical limit, then train a bit more.   


Works a treat."
"I get this question from my friends a lot. Didn’t start smoking until 20, started slow like everyone does, got up to a pack a day in a year or so, then about this this time last year, I just decided I didn’t want to smoke anymore and so I stopped. I still have one on occasion, or I’ll buy a few packs when I go to music festivals. 

The biggest thing that people don’t understand, or maybe refuse to accept, is that you have to actually ***want*** to quit. You can want to quit because you know it’s bad or expensive, but you still want to smoke. You just don’t want the consequences, stigma, etc. 

At the end of the day, you just have to stop buying them. "
"Stop buying them is actually a really good tip. Or if you buy a pack because you ""need"" a smoke, throw it out mostly full after when you feel like a failure. After doing that a couple times you realize how much money you're wasting. "
"I got these minty toothpicks from CVS called Stim-U-Dent. Anytime I wanted a cig, I would just suck on a toothpick. Not the same sensation at all, but enough to calm my cravings for a little while. Good luck!"
"So the habit was always more addictive to me than the chemicals, and the habit is actually a lot of little habits. For example, stop smoking in your car. It's easier than quitting altogether. If you want a cigarette that bad, pull over. I smoked from 15 - 28. I stopped smoking in my car at 20. I stopped smoking at work at 23.

I reached a point where I was smoking 3 a day between getting home from work and bedtime. I cut those out one at a time. The last habit I had to break was 1 before bed. My trick was a shot of whiskey. I would sip it slowly, which is uncomfortable af, but it burned the back of my throat like a cigarette. Eventually I'd gone 2 weeks without a cigarette and I stopped with the whiskey. My dumb brain had only been in that habit for 2 weeks so it was easy to kick.

You will need to spend time away from other smokers. I moved away from my friends. My friends who smoke are still my friends, but I spent a little less time with them for a while. Don't be near them while they smoke...even if it means sitting inside alone for 5 min. You may want to find a game to play on your phone in those situations. Replace the habit with another habit, but then I wouldn't use the same habit for every situation. People who smoke all the time and replace it with vaping just vape all the time. Same with candy, exercise, whatever. But if you mix and match your distractions then you won't have this other overwhelming new habit to deal with."
I used to have a whiteboard that I updated each week with how much money I’d saved so far. 
"Marry a gorgeous, wonderful in every way person who hates cigarettes with a fiery passion. Worked for me."
"Understand that you are going to lie to yourself about why you ‘need’ just one more cigarette. You’ll tell yourself you’re stressed, or you deserve it, or whatever. Avoid that one cigarette for a few weeks and you’ll wake up one day trying to remember how long it’s been since you stopped "
"I started worry about what my teeth were going look like, didn't take much more convincing for me."
"all these people mention the potential health problems, for some reason i couldn't care at all about the side affects down the line, maybe that tells me something about my myself, but for me... it was the money saving... i got one of those apps that tracks the money saved, i was spending over £300 a month on cigs. could buy so much cool shit with that sort of money being literally burnt away."
"Watch a family member die of lung cancer. Pretty morbid, but until the consequences are real, it’s very hard to quit. 

Lost my mother and father-in-law to lung cancer 3 months apart. Never touched one after that. "
"I’m sorry for your loss. I’m dealing with that now.

My grandmother smoked for 40 years and is currently limited to the 25’ that her oxygen tube will let her walk from her bedroom. My mom has to stay with her 24 hours a day and even with a new, and really promising lung cancer treatment, she’s still not half the person she was a few years ago. My best friend’s mother is currently on her death bed with lung cancer. She found out last spring and will be gone by the end of the weekend.

I quit about 5 years ago and after this, I don’t think I’ll ever casually pick one up again. It’s not worth it."
Wellbutrin worked for me. 
well I used to smoke 40 a day. Personally I found that having a heart attack was a very easy motivation to give up. Just over a year this week.
"I hate to be that guy, and I still use nicotine as a disclaimer, but I vape now.. Not benign, still small particles getting in your lungs, but no burnt carbons. All studies show in the conclusion portion that the amount of stuff entering your lungs is more benign than cigarettes. I used to smoke a pack of American Spirits a day (before that, Reds, Newports, etc.) for several years, then started vaping in 2012. Haven't had more than 10 cigarettes since. The risk factor of heart disease remains as long as you use nicotine too, and the risk is just as high if not higher than a cigarette user, so not a great recommendation, but kept me from smoking actual cigarettes."
"Vaping really helped me stop smoking, mainly because it was something I could do to change that didn't force me to abandon my smoking friends."
"My stepson constantly made comments about me quitting. When I mentioned getting a vape, he got so excited. I had to follow through.


What I would NOT recommend is trying to just cut back while switching. I ended up still constantly wanting a cig. I finally just stopped buying them and relied solely on the vape. I'm at 3mg of nicotine and ready to switch to no nicotine.


I haven't had a cig in almost 5 months and now the smell makes me gag.


Edit: I also downloaded an app (Quit Tracker) that tracks my progress. It really puts things in perspective. So far, I've regained 16 days of life and saved almost $500."
Just vape.
Have someone close to you die of horrible lung cancer. 
"I smoked for about 5-6 years.  I got sick with a really nasty sinus infection that caused me to not want to smoke for about a week.  Once I was feeling better, I decided to see how long I could go without a cig.  I am now 2 years clean this month!"
Do not say “I can quit anytime I want” then refuse to quit 
"You have to want to. Tried many times cause I should, or was supposed to and always went crazy. The one time I actually wanted to, Thanksgiving day 2005, it was easy"
Cold turkey is the only way. You'll never ween yourself off of cigarettes.
"Step 1. Get a girlfriend and promise her you'll quit. 

Step 2. Lie to her and say you have quit, but continue to smoke for 5 more years without her knowledge.

Step 3. Move in with said girlfriend."
Smoking used to be a way for me to handle my anxiety. I changed my circumstances and removed the major sources of anxiety. I literally just forgot to buy another pack. That was five years ago. 
"The hardest part was deciding it was time to quit. After that, it's just sticking to your guns. After the irritability passes, there's gonna be a long period of time where you still have cravings and it didn't feel like its getting any easier. This lasts months. But, slowly and surely you'll make it past this.
 

Also, I didnt use any nicotine products to help quitting, but I did allow myself a cigarette or two if I was drunk. I'm not a big drinker so this was rare enough to not negatively impact the whole endeavor. I think having a well defined outlet for cheating can help. Another thing to help is remind yourself how gross it is. Google pictures of tar, and lifelong smokers' teeth, and really learn to appreciate the feeling of clear lungs."
"Cold turkey. Just decided I was done. Never looked back. Sucks at first but if you really want to quit, that’s the way to go. "
I started smoking when I was 9 and wasn't able to stop for the next 42 years. That was a dozen years ago. You can do it too. I tried many things but cold turkey worked best. I usually hate giving advice but will say I  find when I have a craving I get up and go do something where I  can't smoke. Or anything that will occupy the next 30 to 60 seconds while I try to forget I wanted a cigarette. I wish you all the strength you will need. Everything tastes wonderful now. Something to look forward to.
"Exercise helped a lot with the stress. But I honestly think just sweating a lot helped just as much, or more, with getting over the initial hump and impulse. I don't know if there's any validity to that, but I did believe that I could sweat it out of my system. That led to lots of running, as well as hot hot steam showers whenever possible."
"If you gave up smoking, even if you smoked your last one ten seconds ago, then consider yourself a non-smoker. An ex-smoker. You’re not TRYING to quit; you DID quit.

It might sound glib and dismissive, but I went from 30-a-day to quitting, ten years ago so I’ll risk the downvoted to say it - it really is as simple as just not having another cigarette.

I’m convinced that half the problem is that smokers EXPECT it to be super difficult, because others say it’s difficult, which in turn makes it actually difficult - like a big self-fulfilling prophecy.

Compared to other shit you HAVE to do in life (study for exams, break up with lovers, take a shit when you are constipated, grieve the loss of a family member, get up after three hours’ sleep to work a double shift, tolerate a shitty cold for a week) stopping smoking is simply not difficult or unpleasant. 

Once you believe this, you shouldn’t really struggle."
"Alan Carr’s Easy Way to Quit Smoking. Read it once and quit for 6 months... unfortunately broke and started smoking again, so read it one more time and haven’t smoked in 7 years. Do it!"
THIS!!!! 
"My wife, myself and a previous best friend all read Allen Carr's ""Easy Way To Stop Smoking"" We've all been smoke free for almost 5 years. The book is great, but having the support of a loved one was really key for me. "
"I had good luck with this book, too. "
"Here’s how I quit smoking. I quit one day, almost all day. Then I quit the next day, all day. Then the next day, almost all day. And repeat.

The day I knew I was over the hump I hadn’t smoked a cigarette in 6 months (but I had “quit” every day for over a year). I walked past someone on the street smoking and it wasn’t till 2 blocks down that I realized I hadn’t even intentionally  inhaled their used smoke to get a fix.
Quitting is a bitch and you have to do it 10x100 times before it stops being something you think about. But having quit? It’s fucking amazing."
"There are no tips, no drugs, nothing, to help you quit. If you really don't want to quit, you never will. Something has to motivate you big time. For me it was a co-worker. He was a 4 pack a day smoker and he quit cold turkey. I figured if he can quit a 4 pack a day habit, I can quit my pack and a half day habit. Sure enough, it was the motivation I was looking for."
"If you can find licorice root, it looks like a twig, find it at an herbal store, chew on that when the cravings come. helps a little"
"I had a pack in my car for over 6 months, had very little anxiety knowing I could have a smoke and anytime but decided not to... Had I not had them I think I would have been worked up about not having them more than not smoking them"
"Just stfu and stop giving excuses, just quit cold turkey. I did.it worked better than having so much excuses."
I vaped for a while using smaller and smaller nicotine amounts. Eventually I was vaping at a zero level but was still vaping almost constantly so from there I started vaping some shitty flavors combine that with an old coil and I just didn’t want to taste it anymore. I was smoking at least a pack a day. And now I’ve been vape and smoke free for almost 2 years. 
"Keep trying. You actually do get better at it with practice. I 'quit' for roughly a year on two occasions, only to relapse for 2-3 years before trying again each time, but by the last time I quit (4+ years ago - I think I can safely say it's behind me for good, this time), I had a really good idea for what worked for me and what didn't. Even though I was probably *at least* as deeply physically addicted as ever, it was the easiest time by far.

I will say that one 'old saying' held very true for me, every time: The hardest parts are at '3's - 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months. That last one is a bitch, too; you'll think you've got it beat, but *something* will come up - some stress, or maybe a positive thing, like you're out drinking and a smoke sounds good - something will come up, and you'll think, ""Aww, I've got this thing licked! I proved to myself I could do it! I can have *just one*, it'll be fine!"" **Don't.**"
"Stop, don't quit. The word quit carries negative connotations. Count the money you save by not smoking. Count the days with a journal that you are free from smoking. Carry a container of cloves, put a clove stem in your mouth as a substitute taste. You go 8 hours every day without smoking(sleep). All from a book written by a hypnotist. Richard Lovelace i believe. I smoked 3 while reading the book. 30 years ago. Haven't had one since. I was smoking 2 and a half packs a day. Vantage blues, $1.25 a pack. What do they cost now?"
How in the heck does one find time to smoke 50 cigs a day?   Oh and they are about 8 bucks a pack here in usa.
"You have to want it. Finish that last pack and just don't buy another. Replace the habit, I try to drink water (or carbonated water for that extra bite). Everytime you think about buying a pack (or at least as often as you normally would buy one) put that money aside in either a savings account or a jar at home and watch the funds build. After that, buy yourself something nice. Repeat that last step. If you slip up, dont fall back into the spiral, I had a smoke while drunk on sunday, I'm not drinking this weekend so theres no chance I'm repeating that. Best of luck!

Edit: spelling."
"I found a book at the library that had the nicotine levels of just about every single type of cigarette.  The book suggested you smoke a certain type of cigarette for a month and then move to the next type with lower nicotine levels.  I'd say it took about a year to move from regular Camel cigarettes to Vantage Ultra Lights, as I went at my own pace.  There is brand with lower nicotine levels than that, but it was like smoking lettuce leaves and I couldn't stand it.  I then proceeded to use a pushpin to poke the smallest hole into the white paper near the butt.  After a month I would make the hole larger or make two smaller holes.  Although it took me a couple of years, it was a much enjoyable experience than going cold turkey.  EDIT: eventually I went cold turkey, but it wasn't nearly as hard as when I failed going cold turkey off Camels."
"Smoke free for 3 yrs. You have to WANT to quit.

I tried a bunch of times when i felt like i should quit but didn't really want to and still enjoyed smoking. Those arrempts are doomed to fail. When i really wanted to quit i just went cold turkey.

When i did quit the following helped

Chew gum when having cravings.

Look up a list of the health benefits/timeline of quitting. So after 2 days you can look and see an extra day means xyz to you blood pressure etc. It helps the feeling of achievement

Reward yourself. When you reach 1 day, 1 week etc treat yourself with the money you saved."
"Don't count the days. The first few times I quit, I would do the ""it's been X days without a cigarette"" count. I even had one of those apps that keeps count for a while. At some point, I'd break and buy a pack, then quit, restart the count, rinse, repeat. What I realized down the line that keeping count didn't actually keep me from smoking, instead it kept me aware of smoking. Because I was keeping count, I was still thinking about smoking even though I wasn't. So this one time I quit, I forget what but I was EXTREMELY busy with something and lost count, so I gave up counting. Now that I wasn't thinking about cigarettes, or my lack thereof, it was much easier to simply forget them entirely."
Taper off. Conscious effort. Make that final decision. It will be 5 years in March for me and I smoked for 15 years. 
"Get a job where you are treated like an adult.

When I worked fast food and when I was in the military, the only way to get a break sometimes was to go for a smoke. So that's what I did. 

After I got out and started working in a white collar office, I noticed that nobody was keeping track of my location or how often I take breaks. So now, I take breaks when I want to, and I don't have to smoke anymore. I quit smoking almost immediately."
I started at 18 when I was on a ship in the Navy.  Everyone got these smoke breaks and the rest of us kept working.  20 years of being a smoker is what I got for trying to skate!

"If it's a hand to mouth habit, why hit the vape? "
"Ok. Here's what I believe and worked for me. Quit 9-10 years ago.

1. Cold Turkey. Forget the ""I'll taper it off"" idea, and forget the gum. How many posts in here have you seen where the answer is Nicorette? Not many. The reason for this is that these ideas prolong the time period of required disciple. It takes nearly the same amount of self control to follow a rationing schedule as it does to just quit. The difference is, rationing takes twice (or more) the time. The longer the stretch required for self control, the higher likelihood of failure.

2. ""Do it for yourself"" - Bullshit. Unless your an athlete or have some other strong other physical motivation, this isn't likely to work either. There are people with holes in their throat that continue to smoke. Cancer. I put up with hacking up green shit to the point of puking every morning, constantly out of breath, smoking whatever half used cigarette I could find when I didn't have any fresh. Nasty shit - but, quite frankly, the usual. 

So, here's what worked, after countless times -

3. Do it for other people. In doing so, you'll do it for yourself. Read the post about the guy who quit because his wife was getting sick. People who had kids. Etc. The average Joe/Joan needs outside pressure to get it done.
       I was 24 and told my parents I'm quitting smoking, and moving in with them for a week. I knew a couple things - if I failed, they would know almost instantly from the smell. I also knew, they wouldn't laugh, or get mad, but they would be disappointed, and would always remember that failure. Making a bond about something with another person is extremely powerful for us humans, and most of us will fight like hell not to break it. Find a way to do that.

4. How it worked. The first 3-4 are miserable. No surprise. After about a week it's more or less tolerable, and after two weeks, I never thought about it again. It's not that long a time period broken down into hours. I would recommend not drinking for maybe a month, as booze and cigarettes complement each other. Just stick it out.

Good Luck"
"> ""Do it for yourself"" - Bullshit. Unless your an athlete or have some other strong other physical motivation, this isn't likely to work either.

I consider literally being a body a strong physical motivation. You didn't really provide an argument for why doing it for yourself is ""bullshit"". You just pointed out people who obviously don't care about themselves. Plenty of us quit for ourselves, first and foremost."
"Just stop smoking. Stop putting roadblocks up. You don't need tips. You need to just stop smoking. Quitting cold turkey sucks, I'll admit that. I did it and was just miserable for a while. But it's a small price to pay to not smell bad, be able to take a full breath and not shorten your own life expectancy repeatedly."
"Vape naysh y'all.

But it really did work for me so it's something to consider."
"Didn't work for me.  I gave it a fair shot and I generally enjoy it, but it never latched on like cigarettes ever did.  I tried smaller and bigger builds.  Currently using a drip-tip and I really enjoy using it...but it doesn't do it for me.

It seems like although it will help me power through a craving, it's VERY temporary.  And if I use it too much, my lungs feel like I'm drowning.  But it's so yummy "
just stop
[deleted]
"While stopping may be one of the hardest things you will ever do, it is also the hardest step.  Everything after that is cake."
"First, if you have a friend that smokes and wants to quit, quit together. My friend and I made a bet that the first one to smoke again, even a puff, owed the other $500. Neither of us have smoked since, about 4 years ago now.

Second, quit cold turkey. If you smoke more then a pack a day you should probably ween yourself off. Either way, don’t use nicorett gum or the patch or lozenges. Those would be just crutches. That will just decrease your chances of being able to quit.

Third, get involved with an online support group if that will help. Maybe if r/quitsmoking or r/stopsmoking are things, try those.

You may also put all of the cash that you would have spent on cigarettes into a jar, and overtime use it to buy yourself a nice gift or put it away in savings.

Good luck to you. It’s one of the best decisions of my life. I’ve saved so much money. I don’t smell terrible anymore. I am able I focus better."
I don't agree with the cold turkey. I would say replacement is easier but they should do what they are comfortable with.
"Make a conscious decision that you are now a non-smoker. It was 100% for me about having this mindset. You are not a smoker who has quit, or is quitting: you are a non-smoker, simple. I made sure that I did not touch a tobacco product for 3 weeks, and after that if I tried a cigarette because I craved it or missed it (when stressed, drinking or socialising) it tasted disgusting and further reiterated in my mind that I was a non-smoker. That was 12 years ago (I smoked for 7 years) and I've never picked up smoking again. "
This is the best advice I have seen itt
"I suggest quitting cold turkey.  Myself (quit 9 years ago) and the people I know who have quit for good have almost all quit cold turkey.  It seems like having a crutch (vape, gum, patches) inevitably leads back to smoking.

The first 2 weeks are going to be rough, but after that it gets a lot easier.  Exercising and being active helped me a lot.  Drinking just made me want a cigarette so I didn't drink for several months.  A year after I had no real temptation to smoke.  About 3 years after I couldn't (and still can't) stand the smell of cigarette smoke.  It's just really gross and I have no idea why I did it."
"Cigarette smoke, I agree, every time I smell it, my first thought is, “what the hell was I thinking?” Good cigar or pipe tobacco still smells good to me, though."
"Hey there. I started smoking stolen cigarettes from mom’s purse in 1986. I was up to a pack a day in 1990. I stopped for good 7 days, 12 hours, and 10 minutes ago. I haven’t cheated or even thought about it seriously since then. Get yourself an app to keep track of your time & money. Checking my time & money has become a little habit of its own. 

Here’s how you do it. You have to WANT to stop smoking. I’ve quit probably 20 or 30 times before but it never lasted for more than a few hours. I’d hide a few emergency cigarettes, bum them from someone - you get the idea. I never WANTED to stop. I loved smoking. I loved it. When I started you could still smoke on airplanes, for Pete’s sake. It’s gotten hard to smoke for a variety of reasons. I mean, even when you’re OUTSIDE people give you a hard time. Plus, I’ve dropped over $50,000 on ash, litter and making myself unhealthy. What’s crazy is that even after 28 years my body is healing remarkably quickly. 

If you don’t WANT to quit, don’t bother. You’ll find yourself somewhere that sells them or asking someone for one before you know it. I’m 7+ days in. I’m concentrating on how well I’m breathing & sleeping. That’s much better for me. "
Just don't smoke. Don't let excuses win.
"Easy as hell to quit if you buy a decent vaporiser. Not a crappy pen. 

I personally have a sigelei fuchai with a kylin tank, but any of the bigger vapes will do.

It still has nicotine and what not, but certainly better for you than smoking in the long run. You can reduce the amount of nicotine, or just stop altogether whenever you feel comfortable to."
"Y'know, I came in here specifically to see how far the guy advocating vaping got downvoted.

"Quitting brought about (even more) migraines and exhaustion. So I switched to a vape and have used that to ease off. I still use it, but just because the motion is comforting. Not for the nicotine. It can be difficult, but when you realize how much easier it gets to breathe and the money you save, it begins to feel worth it."
Find what will really make you want to give up for me it was getting pregnant and using an e-cigarette I mixed up all the things so I didn’t know if I was getting nicotine or not and just kept adding more no no nicotine ones.
"I chew the cinnamon nicotene gum and it works, I also carry big red because I don't want to increase my nicotene intake like I did with vaping. I made it a year then went on a drinking and smoking bender in july/august. Now Im back to not smoking. "

"Medication can help. I managed to quit a 2-pack a day habit almost 15 years ago. I used Zyban. I also had a great desire to quit and had to completely dig deep for willpower. It helped that I was deployed to Iraq at the time. I know it sounds nuts quitting smoking in a war zone but that actually made it a little easier. First it was sand storm season when I quit. I wasn't going to go outside in that shit just to smoke a cigarette. Second I knew that my then girlfriend (now wife) wasn't going to want to live with me if I smoked. And third: I was in a fucking war zone. Everyone was on edge and acted like a dick. So being an asshole suffering from the ""nic-fits"" didn't really make me stand out. Besides, I was assigned to a unit I wasn't a part of back in garrison in the states So what did I care if they thought I was an asshole once in a while? I never saw any of them after I rotated back home.

One thing I did every day that really helped was remind myself how long it was since I had a cigarette. And also remind myself that if I smoked even just one I would have to start over again. ""I haven't had a smoke in 5 days. But if I have one today tomorrow I'll have to say 'I haven't had a smoke in **ONE** day'. Fuck that""."
"I switched to vaping but had to quit that. People say vaping is the safer altetnative. I disagree. Both my wife and I are runners. We have smoked and ran, been smoke free and done it with vaping. Vaping and running was hard. Worse than smoking."
"After fifteen years of chimney life I went to doctor and asked for help quitting. The doctor said to read “The Easy Way to Quit Smoking” by Alan Carr. She said if I read it and was still smoking she would give me Chantix. 

Read it, followed the directions, and quit cold turkey with zero withdrawal symptoms. In fact, rather than withdrawal, I felt amazing. I attributed it to the fact that my brain was finally getting the correct amount of oxygen for the first time in years. 

I think the biggest thing about quitting is you have to be ready to. You have to be ready to be done with this thing. "
My wife used a e-cigarette(or whatever they are called) but filled it with a liquid that didn't have nicotine in it.
"Alan Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking. I was a 2 pack a day smoker, absolutely loved it, did the audiobook over a week, and on Friday I quit cold turkey, it's been well over a year now, and haven't had a cig since."
Acknowledge that you will always be a smoker. The urges will always happen from time to time no matter the years.
"That's not true, not for every one because I despise even the slightest smell of tobacco. "
"I really thought I wouldn’t be able to quit after 7 years of smoking. I tried to go cold turkey a million times and it didn’t work. But then I focused on “why” do I smoke. 
First, you have to actually want to quit. It helps if you don’t hang out with smokers, I’ll be honest. But even if you do, try to hang out in situations when they’re less likely to smoke (movies, out to dinner etc). 
Then you have to break down the habits/triggers that make you want to smoke, one by one. This is the only thing that worked for me. So my biggest “I need a cigarette” moments came:
-when I was drinking coffee 
-when I was writing 
-driving
-drinking (that’s the biggest one). 
So over the course of 2 years (it really took me that long 😭) I broke each of those habits one at a time. I would challenge myself to drive to work without a cig. Then challenge myself to drive home without one (always saying to myself that I could have one later if I want). 
Then the next day I would say “well, you didn’t smoke while driving yesterday, so you can probably do it again”
Did that with every major smoking trigger. 
The worst was trying to quit while drinking. There’s nothing I love more than a cigarette with a glass of wine. 

For that, I took my first vacation in a while (visiting my husband for a week in mexico) and left my cigarettes at home. I told myself I was just going to drink and hang out for one week without them. I could always smoke when I returned. Then, of course, when I returned, I told myself “hey. You didn’t smoke while drinking in Mexico, so you can drink without a cigarette here” 
A change of scenery was incredibly helpful - if just for a week. 

So now it’s been 4 months and I have no desire to smoke again. I’ll be honest, I tried one a month ago while hanging out with a friend and it just tasted gross. 
Sorry about the ramble, but that’s what worked for me!"
"Lollipops or dum-dums, whatever you want to call them. Get a big bag of them.

Every time you want a cigarette, have one of them instead. I always felt I could deal with the nicotine withdrawal, but I always wanted something in my hand and in my mouth (yeah yeah, I know how that sounds...).

The dum-dums helped with a ton with that. "
don't smoke

Halls. Lots of  Halls eucalyptus. They also work well for “munchie” suppression. 
3rd day is the worst 
"I smoked like it was a cure for cancer for 16yrs. First thing I did upon waking was light a cigarette, last thing I did at night was put one out. When I quit, I was at a minimum of a pack and a 1/2 to 2 packs a day if I went out after work.
During that 16yrs I tried so many times to quit but in the end what worked for me (I've been smoke free for years) is NOT changing any single part of my routine. When I had tried to quit in the past, I would stop drinking coffee, not go to bars with friends (drinking/partying made me smoke more), anything that I associated with smoking until I was passed the initial detox stage, but once I started drinking coffee and socializing more etc...it was still an immense trigger to smoke and eventually that is exactly what I'd end up doing, again. So the final time I changed NOTHING, the only thing I did differently was not smoke. It did make it tougher to begin with, but absolutely nothing became a smoke trigger for me. The one other thing I did was a 1/2 of a nicotine gum when I just couldn't take it any more. I was uber careful not to get addicted to them and only chewed when in absolute agony. These may or may not work for you, but something will bcs I fucking LOVED smoking (just didn't want to pay for it anymore) and if I can do it, you can too!! Good luck!!"
"Find a reason for yourself. A reason that you truly want to quit for. If you can't; forget about it and revisit when you can.

If you don't really *want* to quit, you won't."
"Combination of things for me. Vaping helped. But not the kind that tastes good. I used the 'tobacco' flavor and the vape looked like a cig and it seemed the closest to actual smoking. Never completely scratches the itch, but helps significantly. Also meeting and talking to smokers who had been doing it for decades helped. Just seeing them and hearing their stories made me know I never wanted to let myself get there. It helped give me the strength to keep away from cigs. I was a little over 6 years in when I quit and it was still very difficult to do so. Took 3 separate tries and always seemed to fall back into it either 3 weeks or 3 months in to quitting. Now it's been 4 years."
"Don't count the days you've gone with out a cigarette. It's too much pressure. Just go today without a cigarette. Then tomorrow just go without a cigarette. Repeat.

Also vaping really helped too. It curbed the craving for that one day you want to have a cigarette. 

Resolve and resolution brother!"
"Read ""Allen Carr's easy way to quit smoking"". Its basically magic. I smoked for over a decade, two packs a day. I tried cold turkey, the patch hypnosis, sometimes I could quit for months but would come back, sometimes I could cut it down but I had gotten to a point where I accepted I would never truly quit. Then I read the book and never smoked again, never had the urge to smoke, never had a single withdrawl symptom. Easiest thing I ever did, read the book and you wont smoke.

Every single day of my life since I think ""It feels great that I dont have to smoke today"". Its the best gift you will ever give yourself."
"So I've only been smoke-free for a week and 3 days, so I don't know how much advice I can give. That being said, I've been chewing nicotine gum. Takes the edge off and it's better than smoking. Good luck! "
"Patches helped me go from a pack a day to 0-5. From there, I had hernia sugery and just decided to quit. Was a month nicotine free on Wednesday. You can do it. "
"Change your habits, like a diet. Smokers smoke based more on patterns and habits than they realize. 
Vaping helps for cravings (get a cheap one, it's not a replacement for smoking).
And toothpicks. Good for those driving cravings and after meal cravings. 
It's been over a thousand days since I quit, and I still crave one every fucking day. Accepting that you will want to smoke for the rest of your life is another big part.  "
"Here's what I did: For several nights in a row, hell maybe even a few weeks, I would chain smoke just before bed until the point of feeling like i was about to puke. Then I got some nicotine gum and chewed way more than i was supposed to, again, I felt like I was going to puke. Did that until the two week supply was gone. I forced myself to associate smoking cigarettes with feeling like I was going to puke, so it was less enticing to pick the habit back up if I felt any urges. I did this roughly 10 years ago. I've smoked a few times since then when drinking with friends strictly in a social setting and I've never had any desire to pick the habit back up, even the act of smoking while drinking wasn't pleasurable, so it's been years since i've done that as well. This may not be your traditional method, but for me it worked."
"Don't give yourself ""time until x and then I quit"". I've done that 3 times and I managed like two weeks each time.

You have to just decide to quit, and do it right there and then. For me that was when I was running (I exercised for a 5k) and realised my performance was piss poor because my lungs were fucked after 3 years of smoking.

I decided to quit then, on the walk back home. And with some effort actually managed it."
"You will only quit when you are truly ready, then, and only then quit and never do it again."
Don't change your lifestyle at the same time. For me I took a week away then came back and did everything the same without the smokes. Aka still went out for cigarette brake.
"Kept getting tonsillitis. 

Figured I’d try not smoking anymore.

Stopped getting tonsillitis.

Haven’t felt the need to smoke since, because tonsillitis sucks and I guess I want to live longer Idk.
"
"I was a smoker for 9 years before quitting.
The most important thing is to make the decision to quit. You cant just ""kinda"" want to quit, you must really want it. 

I decided in November that I would have my last cigarette on the 1st of January and smoked normally until them. On the new years eve I even bought a pack and finished it the same night. Didn't smoke ever since.

It wasn't easy, especially the first week, but after 1 month I felt much better. 

It has been almost 3 years now and sometimes I still feel like having a smoke. When that happens I just try to distract myself.

EDIT: A word"
"Black peppercorn, take one every time you feel like a cig, worked for me :-)"
"You have to want to quit. I quit before for six years and have a little over four and half years this go around. Neither time would have been successful if I truly didn't want to quit, otherwise you're just wasting your time."
"I smoked a pack a day for a little over ten years. Every time I quit and failed, I tried to 'customize' the solution for me. I.e, use the gum or the patch most of the time, but not on weekends or stressful days. 

The successful quit was when I finally said ""im buying patches, in the strength they recommend, will not smoke at all, and it doesn't matter how uncomfortable it is or how expensive it is, I will continue until there are no more patches"".

Nicotine patches are uncomfortable and leave zitty, rashy patches. People don't talk about that part. Or that they cost more than cigarettes for less nicotine.

But in the end, it was shutting the fuck up, doing what the box said, and sticking to my guns that got me to quit. "
Avoid bars and other situations where you will drink alcohol around other smokers for the first month. It's the easiest place to get sucked back into smoking. 
You already quit. It's easy to quit. The hard thing is to not start again.
Quit at the same time as my wife and we were both too stubborn to be the first one to go back
Ecig
"In all honesty it is the nicotine dosage you are use to. Vapes/e-cigarettes let you control your dosage and you can decrease it gradually over time. Then when your down to 3mg or less, you start seeing less of a dependence on it. Eventually I just stopped all together within a year. Still vape during the cold months though, vape and coffee in the morning (used to be cig and coffee). Honestly it changed everything. "
"Make quitting your new habit. Keep trying, you will fail many times, but keep at it and it’ll get easier. Also, condition yourself to be disgusted by cigarettes. If someone’s smoking on the street take a wide path around them like it makes you sick. Cringe if you see butts on the ground. Get used to seeing cigarettes as a revolting, nauseating, poisonous turd candle. "
"Keep on trying and be introspective about why you tricked yourself to think that it was fine for you to start again. If you can come to the realization that your brain always keeps a ""valid"" reason to come back to it at some point and crush those though you will have a greater chance of success. Also, multiple attempts makes you better at dealing with the psychological withdrawal."
"I quit in 2008. I made it a game. I really cared about the streak more than I cared about the health improvements. Eventually, I cared about the health improvements more. I always heard of you can make it 3 days, you can quit.  So I made it to 3. Then 4,5,6,7 and so on.  You get to a certain point where you might want a cigarette, but that would mean your streak is over and you have to start over.  I had dreams where I would smoke and wake up temporarily upset, but realize it was a dream and my streak was still in tact. Anyone can quit and everyone should quit. 

I also had some motivation to get it started.  My now wife, then friend, said it was gross. Also, you’re paying some mega corporation to poison yourself.  People are getting rich off of you fucking your shit up.  That doesn’t seem right. "
as soon as I realized how disgusting my cough was I knew i needed to stop. Coughing up all the nasty black mucus from your lungs in the months after quitting was enough to convince me to never go back. 
I got TB. They get really cranky in the respiratory clinic when you rock in for your TB treatment smelling of cigarettes.
"You have to want it...

you cant quit for someone else, You have to want to quit



How did i quit? I delayed before my next smoke, Instead of having one now, lets rather smoke in 30minutes. When the 30minutes was up, let's delay it again..

about 10 years later, i still waiting "
"Your mind has a crazy ability to convince you of things.  On Friday, it will try to convince you that you should really just buy a pack and wait until Monday to quit.  On Monday, it will assure you that it makes the most sense to wait until the weekend to quit, so you should just go buy a pack.  You need to be committed to telling your mind to fuck right off with that."
"Everyone can quit for just one day right? Do that everyday. Wake up and quit for the day, not forever cause that’s stressful. Just one day and repeat. This has worked for me for 2 and a half years. "
Persistent is key. Tried for 2 years and it eventually worked. 
"Quit when my ex was pregnant. Because I didn't want the baby to be around smoke and figured I'd get a jump start on it. 

&#x200B;

So that's my advice. Have a baby. :p "
"For me, the first 3 days were the hardest. I'd say it peaked on day 3, with shakes and irritability. You really have to want to quit. I quit multiple times, but if I got stressed, I'd revert back to it again. It's when I finally wanted to quit, that I had success. I used nicorette gum at first, and changing my routine up to take away the triggers. It's not easy, and I still have moments where I want one, but I feel so much better now. I never realized how hard it was to breathe when I got sick, or how much I wheezed when I laughed. "
Read Allan Carr’s easy way to quit smoking. Worked for everybody I know who read it and quit.
"I'd say isolation. For me, the best thing was to sleep off the haze of not smoking. It was foggy brained and angry. I slept a lot. Around the 30th day I came home and was like ""Cool! I can do something and not want to destroy it!"" 

Also, mini nicotine lozenges. If you don't want to be a cave dweller for a month to get past the bad stages, level out with these. "
"Every day you don't at least try is another day you won't quit. It's not a lot of fun, but it's not impossible either. When you want a cigarette, put it off. Postpone it as long as you can every time. Try to take your mind away from it by thinking about something else. 

Idk, some people use gum or patches. "
"Cold turkey is the only way. (There is always a way to justify the next ""one."") Remind yourself about all the money your saving and extra years you're adding to your life. "
"I did nicotine gum and patches at the same time. I would dip during the day and smoke on work breaks and weekends. Eventually got off the pitches and switched to regular gum. I been good for over 2 years now. I do believe everyone will need their own methods to quit, every person is different."
"dont buy them, 

Dont go where people are smoking, 

Do not meet up with people who smoke, because they will ply you with freebies and shame you into smoking, because addicts hate people who have the strength to quit,

Drop and do 10 (20 if you are fit) every time you feel that you are going to say yes, no matter where you are, everyone will ask what the hell you are doing and you can openly say, ""I was going to take a  smoke, but now I know I can say no"" re-enforce your will power."
Quit cold turkey. The first week will be tough but it should get better. Just focus on your goal. 
"Just realizing how bad your breath smells after smoking throughout the day does miracles, really! I used to think that people who hate cigarette odour are just ""normies"". Once I stopped smoking for a few weeks, I suddenly realized that people who smoke smell bad, like  shit-equivalent bad.  Realizing that that's how non smokers perceive me, it was much easier not to return smoking.

 Also, realizing that out of 10 cigs I've smoked, maybe 1 made me feel somewhat good, while the other 9 did just absolutely nothing for my mood. 

"
"I've been cigarette-free for 12 days now so I'm hardly an expert but I've quit a few times before and feel like I'm doing it right this time. I bought a fairly expensive vape as an investment towards staying smoke free. I also use tobacco flavoured vape juice so its a similar taste. I also use nicotine gum for that 'after-meal' craving, which really works. Overall, I'd say the first 3 days are the hardest. You'll feel a little spacey as your body adjusts to the lack of cigs but I personally feel more grossed out by cigarettes the longer I don't smoke."
"Cold turkey is the only way.  I tried every other cessation device and all that does is prolong the nicotine addiction/withdrawal.  Embrace the fact you’re going to be short-tempered and lacking a filter for a time.  Certainly throw in some exercise and healthy snacks, lots of water, and breathing exercise.

You also have to really want to quit.   By the time I finally quit for real I genuinely wanted to.  

Whyquit.com was also really helpful for me, as were the discussion forums.  "
"Cold turkey worked for you and my grandparents. I don’t know anyone else who was able to just quit. I’ve tried a few times, failed because I genuinely don’t want to quit smoking. I enjoy it, I enjoy the actions you make while smoking. The hard part for me isn’t really not smoking, it’s not doing the things I do while smoking. "
"Don't give up. The average successful quitter made seven previous unsuccessful attempts.

Have a plan. You will get past the symptoms of physical addiction in a few days, but you need a plan to deal with the habitual and psychological symptoms. 

To break the habit change whatever you do that you currently associate with smoking. Smoke with coffee? Start drinking tea. Take smoke breaks at work? Take a walk break instead. You get the idea.

The psychological addition is what gets dooms most quit attempts. Many people self soothe with tobacco, so when the shit hits the fan they return to what they know will make them feel better. The old cliche of someone buying a pack of cigarettes for the first time in years after some traumatic life event is actually quite accurate. The way to handle it is to realize that traumatic (and not-so-traumatic, but nonetheless troubling) life events occur and to have a plan on what you will do when the craving hits.

And don't give up."
"Get rid of **everything** related to smoking.  Lighters, ashtrays, matches, cases, you name it.  Then, thoroughly clean your house, all your clothes, your furniture, and your vehicle's interior.  Don't be stingy with the fabric freshener spray.

If you wear hats, clean those, too.  Once you've stopped smoking for a few days, you'll be very aware of any residual smoke smell, and it can be very tempting, especially during your daily routine.  

When you quit, ***QUIT***.  No half-measures."
"I used an app, lots of exercise, prunes and a mild laxative. My main reason for picking up a cig after attempting to quit was the lack of peristalsis and fear of weight gain. At 3 weeks, i’m over the hump and think that bodily functions are also getting back to “normal”. Have no desire for a cig and can even sit with someone as they smoke and not be tempted."
Just go to a doctor and get Chantix. You'll be done smoking in a month.
"This worked for me,  over 10 years cig free. "
One day at a time. You’re going to want one everyday at some time. For the first 6 months. After the first 2 weeks It gets a lil easier everyday. 
"Simply read 'Alan Carr's Stop Smoking'
Talk to you about the actual act, the science and removes the FEAR."
"Quit cold turkey. Then alter how you think about it. You don’t need to be strong willed. You don’t need to think “I can resist this urge”. 

Instead, whenever you think about smoking allow yourself to feel a sense of relief. Think “oh man, it’s nice that I don’t have to worry about that anymore. I don’t have to bother going outside, I don’t have to worry about how I smell. This is great!” 

This mental trick turns quitting from a battle into a pleasure. Sounds dumb maybe but it really worked for me. "
I’m only three weeks at this point but I can already see a nice savings in the bank considering I was buying a pack a day.  Truthfully I quit a zillion times and this particular time was because I was so broke and didn’t want to charge cigs anymore.  Sucked it up.  Keep ignoring the cravings. Haven’t been to smoking bars  or really drank that much at all honestly since thy go hand in hand. 
Juul
The trick is to have a cigarette and then never have another one again until you die.
"Both my parents quit cold turkey about ten years ago after about 40 years of smoking for my mom and 50ish for my dad. What they did is  sit down and do the math on how much money they were spending on cigarettes per month. They were both pack+ per day smokers, so it ended up being about 1000 a month. My mom told my dad that they were smoking what they had left and then were done. It worked, although my dad was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer about 9 months later."
"Mine was almost purely financial. I didn’t have a lot of money to save and use for hobbies and toys after bills. I did the math, and at $11 for my (former) brand, times 2 packs a day, it something like $600 dollars a month is saved. Now, I’ve reigned my spending back in and am trying to upgrade my overall quality of life. "
"Du it cold turkey, fuck nicotine patches,cum,spray vapes whatever..just quit.

Helpfull for the cravings is to do something orally, have a mint, chew ona toothpick,have a piecve of fruit.. something to take your mind of the craving, they wont take long to go away.

and nr 1 tip, It´s much much easyer then you think, it´s all in your head anyway so just put your mind to it.

"
"Everyone’s different, but here’s what worked for me: 

1. First, I cut back. This not only reduced my addiction, but also reduced the frequency of habit. 

2. When you officially quit, have a non-tobacco source of nicotine available. I had some nicotine patches even though I wasn’t doing the whole patch “program” where you use them to slowly taper off. I ended up using two patches total, at the lowest dose they came in, at moments of “fuck this, I feel like shit and want a cigarette!” Once the symptoms wore off and I was past that “fuck this” moment, I removed the patch. It just kept me from choosing a cigarette to satisfy my addiction. 

3. I stayed away from smoke and smokers for a while to avoid temptation. 

4. Over the next few years, I didn’t view it as a failure or as a reversion back to being Smoker with a capital S if I had a cigarette or two. I had handful of such “slips” while out for a night of drinking, but I just didn’t allow myself to view that as, “Welp, I guess I’m smoking again, then.” I just woke up the next day still thinking of myself as a non-smoker and went on with life. (That said, I also didn’t let myself start thinking I could  “smoke socially.” That’s how I became a Smoker with a capital S the first time!) 
"
"Just fucking do it. No excuses. No ""cutting down"".

You're either smoking or you're not smoking. ""Quitting smoking"" is a delusion, you're still smoking. 

Oh, and if you find yourself relapsing after that one cigarette with your night of drinking, then quit drinking and adapt the ""never again, policy."
"This may or may not work for people, but it did for me. Sometimes you don't crave the smoke, but having something in your mouth instead. Which I why I took up chewing on toothpicks. Haven't picked up a smoke in 2 years."
This is the one that got me. Write an honest list of pros and cons. Two weeks of a struggle is worth it for the rest of your life. Also I actually wanted to quit.
"You really have to want to quit. Can't just be on the fence about it. You have to commit, fully.

Was a heavy smoker for almost 20 years and tried many different methods to try to quit. The patch is ultimately what kept me going strong. I used to have extreme cravings when trying cold turkey, the patch almost completely alleviated all the nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

Going to the gym helped as well as it let me focus my energy on something else and distracted me from any small cravings that would sneak by the patch. But, discipline is what is going to clench the deal for you here."
just dont smoke my man
"This will probably sound like bad advice, but this is what worked for me after trying vaping, Chantix (good for those who it works for, but Jesus it had some horrible affects on me), the patch, and gum.

Like a lot of people, I went cold turkey but unlike previous attempts I instead hit my vices harder than I normally would. I relished in the pain of cravings after eating. I drank more knowing that I'd like to eventually drink and not smoke. I hung out around smokers still. 

The idea was that I had heard a lot of people have cravings years after quitting due to certain triggers. I wanted to reset my triggers. By resetting those triggers to not be associated with smoking anymore, it made quitting long-term easier. 

Now, I'll say that the first week this way was way harder than any other way, but it was pretty smooth sailing after like 2 weeks. I've been smoke free for over two years and unlike many I absolutely do not have any cravings to smoke. "
"'Quitting forever and ever' was a very stressful thought for me. 

What worked was to not smoke for 24h. If I was going to smoke after that 24h, so be it.

Tl;DR: One day at a time."
"This is probably going to be downvoted to all hell but what helped me years ago was just making a conscious decision that I'm not a smoker anymore. I had tried quitting a few times (even tried those make cigs taste like shit pills) but always seemed to crack and go back to it. By approaching it with the ""I'm trying to quit"" mentality you give yourself the possibility of failing to quit, but once I made the conscious decision that ""I don't smoke anymore"" it stuck. I did still get cravings but whenever any of my friends offered me a smoke I just said ""nah, I don't smoke anymore."""
"Honestly, I never had a hard time quitting cold turkey, even when I got up to a pack a day. What would set me back is I always started smoking again while drinking. So in order to keep the habit gone, I stopped drinking for like two or three months because the temptation was too strong and my willpower was nonexistent when drunk.

I guess my advice is, if you have something you STRONGLY associate smoking with, quit it too if possible for awhile until you break that association, then resume it. If it's something you cannot quit, such as you smoke while driving to/from work, have a replacement. My brother-in-law packed a little bag of snacks to eat on his car ride home instead of smoking. 

Best wishes getting tobacco free! I still get urges sometimes but it's been 5 years for me, so I rarely think about actually giving into those urges anymore. "
"Be drunk for 3 days. When you want to smoke.... drink. 
3 days too drunk/sleep/hungover to smoke. Then physical addiction is over.
The rest is habbit.
And then you are stubborn enough to not give in to something silly and weak as just a mental habit... 
Dont let your mind play that trick on you.

And then for over 2 years have super realistic dreams of smoking a cig......"
Cold turkey is the only sustainable option
"Don't make a big deal out of it. Just stop. 

I found every time I tried and I told everyone that I was quitting, then people kept questioning me about it and asking how it's going etc.

Once I just stopped smoking without telling everyone and just pretended that I never smoked, I just stopped. Probably won't be as easy for everyone, but it certainly worked for me."
"First and foremost, you have to be ready.  Don't just think you're ready. No fallback plan.  You have to be prepared to quit.  Give yourself goals to meet.  They don't have to be huge goals.  If you always have a smoke after dinner, give that one up. 

Myself, I used vaping as a tool.  This was about 4 years ago, before it got huge and ""showy"".  As soon as I got my e-cig, that was it for buying smokes. It came with a small bottle of the juice. I think it was 24mg or 2.4% nicotine.  Each time my bottle was empty, which took about 2 weeks, I cut the nicotine in half.  By the time I got to 0%, I was elated. At that point, on my second day of the 0% juice, I asked myself why I'm even doing it. I put it down and never picked it up again.  My wife was doing the same thing, and put hers down 2 weeks after me. 

If you're trying to quit, don't make it big news. Don't do it for the glory. Do it for you and if you have kids, do it for them. Hell, if I could do it, anybody can! "
"You have to want to quit, then you quit.  It isn't easier or harder than that.  I got home one day from work I smoked 1.5 packs a day, and my kid wanted a hug and Kiss, and I said no I had to wash first, she looked devastated.  Last time I smoked."
"Get a coronary calcium heart scan. Look at the results with your doctor. Realize that what you're viewing is in large part due to the inflammation that smoking causes throughout your body. Realize that what you are viewing is similar to viewing the gun that will likely kill you one day.

Your face then feels hot, you have a horrific sinking feeling in your gut as it dawns on you that you are the one who loaded that gun. 

I put them down that afternoon, cold turkey, after 36 years. Quit, quit now."
"I bought a JUUL.  Started replacing cigarettes with vaping.  After two weeks, am exclusively using JUUL .  It's only been a week but I went to gas station to buy pods and had no desire to buy a pack.

I have a long road ahead of me but I'm fighting for my life."
"Late to the party here, but I quit cold turkey after smoking for 15 years. I smoked all but the last cigarette in my pack, and then kept that pack on me for a few months. Every time I wanted a smoke, I would take out that last cigarette and think about it. Finally ended up throwing it away. Haven’t smoked in almost 4 years now! "
Just woke up and didnt light one. Havent smoked in 3 months
"Improve other aspects of your health (diet, exercise, sleep) and the negative effects of smoking will be more noticeable. It’s hard to keep smoking when you can feel it restricting your breathing, speeding up your heart, etc. 
CBD vapes are also great. Doesn’t give you a head rush like nicotine vapes but helps with anxiety and irritation. "
Get old. I went from a casual smoker to hating it just by the simple fact of getting migraine like hangovers every monring after I had even 1 smoke the night before. Now I can't even stand to be in smoky bars. 
"After 10 years of a pack a day smoking, I can happily say that as of today, I am 10 days smoke free. The first 4-5 days are the worst, and I chewed the shit out of nicotine gum. After that, cravings subside and I replace every other piece of nicotine gum with dentyne ice, and now I just chew the dentyne. The cravings never fully go away, you just don't notice them as much, and are easier to ""shrug"" off. 

The biggest factor for me though, is will power. If you don't truly want to quit, you won't. You absolutely need the drive and motivation to plow through those first few shitty days."
"I quit cold turkey but my appetite went up and I basically ate every bit of food I saw to distract me.

This happened for a few weeks

This does work but obviously comes with the price of gaining pounds.
 
I guess my point is find something else to distract you from the urge to smoke.
"
"Cold turkey, and try to enjoy the pain of withdrawals,tenis ball technique,cold showers "
Nicotine patches work good

"I switched to a vape and then used the patches. It wasn’t a magic cure but it really does help the cravings, just take it off when you sleep cuz man it’ll fuck up your dreams. 

I don’t like gum and mints, so I would practice my singing instead, because then it forced me to think about the song. Took my mind off it and was good practice. 

Any non stressful hobby is good. I used to play league of legends and would always smoke when it made me mad, and other things too. Quitting those stressful things reduced my cravings since it was how I coped with them. "
Vaping then weaning off 
"The first week is HARD and takes grit (and lots of sunflower seeds). After that it gets much easier. Chew lots of whitener gum, keep sunflower seeds in your car at ALL times and drink tons of water. Good luck!"
"Just do it.  You have to remind yourself that you don't ""need"" that cigarette.  The cravings will pass if you keep yourself occupied with something else and breaking the relationship that cigarette has to certain activities.  Smoking is more of a habit that gives you something to do more than anything else.  Once you break the habit of relating smoking to going out with friends/break time at work/having a beer/driving ect it became very easy to quit."
"When you feel like having a smoke, drink a glass of water"
Just stop.  Thinking about it makes it worse.
"You've got to want it. No, not kind of, not feel like you have to, you have to viscerally, deeply WANT to stop smoking.

(Hopefully, it won't be a health scare that makes you want to quit, like it was for me. Thought I might lose my leg. Scared the living hell out of me. ... Finally quit two weeks later. Heh.)"
"Just quit. Go cold turkey. If you need some sort of help, replace smoking with something else. Eating fruits worked for me. "
Just don't tell anyone you are quitting. Puts unnecessary pressure on yourself and when you have moments of weakness you feel defeated and worse about yourself. Just make the conscious decision to quit and keep it to yourself. 
" Several points:

  


1.) Create new habits. I used to enjoy a cigarette after work every day on my balcony. Of course I also smoked in between, but just going on my balcony made me lust after a cigarette. I used to buy some (non-alcoholic) beer or special lemonade as a treat.

&#x200B;

2.) Pro and Contra Lists. Many non-smokers (who possibly never smoked) don't seem to understand why people would smoke. It's expensive, it's unhealthy, it smells! Write down whatever is annoying about smoking to you. 

While all of these points are true, it would be delusional to say that there are no other positive things about smoking.

&#x200B;

In my case, for example, I liked several things about it. It was my excuse to take a break several times a day, especially at work: So I watched out that I would still take some small breaks in between, because I did not want to associate smoke-free with harder work.

I used to smoke in stressful situations. I used deep breathing techniques and mindfullness.

In ""positive"" situations where smoking was my treat, I was looking for other treats (sweets, gum, a nice smelling candle, small things like that).

&#x200B;

Honor the positive things about smoking. Try to find other ways to get ""the good things"". And if you fall back and have a cigarette, don't treat it as a failure. It's part of recovery to have set-backs. Just start new. Focus on your list. What do you want in life, why do you want to quit, what helps to feel better.

&#x200B;

3.) Avoid smoking areas. This was big for me, personally, because surrounded by smokers was much, much harder to resist the urge.

Remember that physical addiction is not your biggest enemy- the psychological one is. Don't try to reason 'that it's stupid' and ignore it blindly. Try to make a decision to be smoke-free. If you relapse, decide it again. It's hard. It can stay hard. That's okay. Good luck!"
"Not me but my Grammie. I was 6 years d in the bath at my Grammies house. She went outside for just a few minutes to smoke, and when she came back I was drowning. She saved me and then quit smoking from then on. Unfortunately she died when I was 18 from COPD among other health problems, but I admire her for taking the event seriously enough to quit that moment.  "
"When I was quitting someone told me that the craving for a cigarette only lasts as long as it takes to smoke a cigarette. If you get the craving and can hang tough for 5 minutes, the craving will generally pass. At least until the next time your body wants one.

You have to ride out one craving at a time. One day at a time. And mentally prepare yourself for a long few months. "
I vaped and gradually lowered the nicotine strength in my liquids until I was on 0% nicotine and then one day I realised I hadn't vaped all day because I had no cravings so i quit that as well.
"Two things I learned after trying a million times and the last time it finally taking for good, hopefully: 
1. It takes awhile to get over it. If you smoked for 20 years you don’t get over it in a week. It took a good year to really feel like I was getting past it. 
2. And I learned this the last time I quit and it’s worked so far all there years, I can’t slip back to it even once. No cigar while playing golf. No hit of a friends cigarette outside the bar late. Because that’s what always tripped me up before. Stay vigilant. "
"Gonna get buried now but honestly, cold turkey was the easiest way. I tried patches, the inhalers and vaping but the best way is to just go cold turkey and fight through it. Any other way you end up transferring your addiction to somewhere else, when my brother tried to quit he ended up addicted to dr pepper of all things. Vaping is a decent way of doing it if you still want to go through the motions but doing it in a hopefully safer manner. "
"First you have to really want to quit. Doesn't matter the reason but from the bottom of your heart you need to want to quit.

Second you need to realize that you're an addict. And it's just like quitting any other drug. It's a bit easier because you don't have actual pangs that hurt.  It's a bit harder because smoking is everywhere.

Cutting down never worked for me. It's because when you cut down, you wait for those times when you can have that precious cigarette. Stop romanticizing smoking.

I read the book everybody's talking about. But I think it only helped because I wanted it to. And the hardest part was not quitting, it was staying clean. 

You have to get rid of it from your routine. For me the hardest was when I had to wait for something. Cigarette always helped with passing time. Now it's reddit. 

Now sometimes when it gets hard you need to remind yourself why you're better now. And why was it horrible to smoke. For me it's all the times I wanted a cigarette so bad, I couldn't enjoy the activity I was doing. Because in many activities you can't smoke. But if you want to, that's the only thing you think about. So whenever I think that maybe want just one cigarette,  I try to remember that feeling. Because if I take one, I will probably start again."
I quit smoking once. Worst day ever 
Don't start
"Giving up is easy, its hard to keep at it. Distance yourself from the other smokers for a week or two and just quit. It won’t work unless you see the damage it is causing to you. Once you see the physical damage on your own body is when you really need the feel to stop. "
"Switched to Cuban handrolled cigarillos. Robust smoke. Never fully inhaled. 

The nicotine buzz comes on slower than tobacco, making them less addictive. Smoked 1-3 per day for a few weeks, then stopped. 

Still smoke cigars on special occasions but never cigarettes "

"I recommend people look into the use of LSD. Probably more effective than any method I've tried. This varies per person though, as some people turn into chainsmokers while on acid."
"I never felt weening off worked, I just stopped, I ate a lot of lifesaver mints and a big problem I had was a problem with my hands, your hands get into the habit of smoking also, so I had to keep them busy, at the time I would play a lot of video games and anything else to keep them busy. "
"Get an eCig with enough juice and batteries to make sure you always have a vape handy.  Treat it like a diabetic kit, meaning if you forget it at home, you turn the fuck around and go get it, no matter what.  

Never put yourself in a position where you can justify grabbing smokes, because you will.  Smokes are WAY easier to get your hands and they cost less than having to buy a backup battery or bottle of juice on the fly.  Be smart. Have some discipline.  Remember why you want to quit smoking.  

Throw your cigarettes away and don't buy more.  

After about 90 days start stepping down your ejuice nicotine level until you're evdntually vaping at 0mg.  It's perfectly okay if it takes a couple of years to get there.  I guarantee that once you are vaping at 0mg you'll question why the hell you're vaping at all.  

Oh, and don't become one of those douchy vape asswads.  It's a nicotine delivery system, nothing more."
"I curved my habit by smoking lots of weed. 

&#x200B;"
"Start exercising, start keeping track of exactly how much money you're saving by not smoking, and find a different way to occupy your hands in times where you'd normally smoke. "
"A big part for me was coming to terms with the fact that you’re addicted to it and won’t be able to eventually be a “just occasionally” user.  You’ve gotta accept that your last smoke really will be your last and go with it from there.

Doing it while also making some other sort of routine change helps too, like if you’re moving or changing jobs, good time to do it.  Or just switch things up enough to remove some of your daily triggers.  Maybe start a new fitness plan, or bring lunch to work instead of going out.  Whatever you can do to cut out those “I always smoke after _____” moments."
"I just stopped, same as my father...

Stop picking up the goddamn cigarette and lighting it, that’s literally all it takes.

I also love the “it reduces my stress” no, no it doesn’t stop lying to yourself."
"YMMV but here is what I did.  Waited for a long weekend.  And locked myself inside my house for the entire time.  Announced to everyone I lived with ahead of time what was happening.  And asked for patience.  After day 3 it got easier.  

I'm now 8 years nicotine free.  However I still crave it. Every day I want one. But the cravings are different, easily subsided by changing my thoughts.  Rather than it consuming them.  Everything that used to be a trigger still is.  Every drink, every car ride, every meal.  But I just think about anything else and it goes away easily.  Some days are easier than others. But overall it was a good move. "
"I tapered off the amount per week and used life changes to not include smoking in them.

e.g. figure out how many cigarettes you smoke per week and cut down by 5 each week going forward. The slow decrease isn't going to drive you nuts but you can at least get used to less and less.

Life changes are a good opportunity to develop new habits. I got a new car and decided i wouldn't smoke in it, as much as I loved smoking and driving, I was able to consciously avoid it. Cut my amount per day down a lot right there.

When I started dating my now wife, I made a promise not to smoke around her - was open about my habit and she understood and appreciated that I would refrain from doing it when we were together. Ended up smoking even less when we moved in together because she was around a lot more often!

Getting a new job and not hanging out with the smokers is huge too. Developing a ""oh it's 10am, better go for a smoke"" routine at work is very hard to change.

If you can just use all the changes life throws you to develop healthier routines that don't involve smoking."

"Cold turkey is the only effective way to go. Can't ween yourself off.

And you have to actually WANT to quit. Quitting bc someone else wants you to, or quitting because you kind of think you should won't work."
"Learn to find the smell disgusting. What helped for me was one night of drinking where I smoked a stupid amount of darts in one go. Eventually I found them gross. Woke up with that smell on my hand and decided enough was enough. Got on the vape to help with the oral fixation. Occasionally I’ll have one, by the time I’m half way done I feel gross and remember why I stopped buying them fuckers. "
Wellbutrin. Suppressed the urges and let me wean off. 
Both of my parents stopped smoking twice in their lives. It really takes a positive mindset. You need to be disciplined and determined to quit. Make a goal and strive for it. Find another outing to replace smoking like reading or exercise.
"For me vaping is doing the trick and saving my life. 

But don't just go into a store and get whatever they try to push on you.
Do extensive research on devices and their function and get something you might enjoy. 

Also ask Vapers for advice on devices. Try to find someone willing to take some time and explain whats up. 
Many vapers(me 2) have their recommended devices for smokers.
And they are not trying to sell you anything like the store clerk.

Also don't bother to much with the looks of the device. If your a flashy person go flashy. But the looks off the device don't say much about whether you'll like the important part. The vaping.

I think it's also the way to go if you don't want to use anything anymore. In my experience and that of other vapers/exvapers
it is much easier to quit vaping or to not vape for some time than it is to quit smoking. Either by just stopping or first lowering your nicotine dose. And you can do the latter without substracting from the vape experience.

I am not certain why that is. I attribute this to some of the other thousands of chemicals that are in cigarette smoke.
"

"What worked for me was honestly that I got to a point where I hated smoking. 

In terms of little things that helped with cravings and stuff, I found that exercise was a huge help in general, and for dealing with cravings on the spot I'd down a super cold glass of water really fast or eat some chocolate. 

I sort of exchanged my most habitual smokes with other things. I swapped my morning smoke for a brisk walk. Swapped my after lunch smoke for dark chocolate. Swapped my after work smoke for a jog. My after dinner smoke was the toughest, but I would push through it with a tall glass of ice cold water and deep breathing. "
"If you are serious about quitting, take a week off work when you can. Wait til your next week off from school or whatever. Smoke all your tobacco leading up to it. Smoke til your sick of them, and when you have none left, don't buy more. 3 days in you feel like shit. 5 days in it's out of your system, then it's just the habit. 

Doesn't matter if you do nothing productive that week. Find a series to binge. Exercise. Find no excuse to go to any shops. Take the money you would have spent on it and save it. Buy food before the weeks starts, find something delicious and healthy to cook. Challenge yourself in the kitchen. 

By the end of the week, you don't crave nicotine. You want to go outside for a cigarette. There is a difference. Week 2, go back to work. This is the hard part because you're used to taking smoke breaks, or smoking during your break. You also have access to people who will give you a cigarette. 

You can't let them give you one. You've just gone a week without. The habit isn't broken and it's up to you to not go back. Think of the reason why you quit. It's all psychological. You have suffered the withdrawal effects. You have suffered. Don't allow yourself to suffer when you next decide to quit. You deserve to be healthy. You've got this. "
"First you have to actually *want* to quit. If you don't really want to it's going to be nearly impossible. The temptations are always there even after you have been smoke free for years.

Next, you probably have your routine. Do you light up after a meal? When you get in the car? When you first wake up? When you drink? Choose one of your patterns and drop it. I got a new car and so I told myself I wouldn't smoke in it. Eventually I cut out like 5-10 smokes a day since a majority took place on my way to and from places.

Then I cut out after meals. Instead I'd brush and floss my teeth so my breath would be fresh. Eventually my brain rewrote the craving to the urge to brush or chew gum.

Then I picked up working out. I'd go running or lift weights. That extra energy and motivation from quitting made me feeling better about my body and my health. 

I've been smoke free for almost 2 years now. But almost every time I'm out with friends who are still smokers, I still get the urge to bum one. Whenever I do though...I just think how far I've come and what a shame it would be to fall backwards."
"It helps to have a reason other than ""it's healthier"", because smokers obviously know its unhealthy and they smoke anyways.

I didn't want to get rejected by women in case smoking was a deal-breaker... but it turns out they are quite adept at finding other reasons."

"I’m late to the party but I hope OP sees this. My university had a real tobacco products problem and so they started offering free classes to help people quit (in addition to free gum and patches) and, while it still took me a few attempts to successfully quit smoking and dipping when I ultimately did quit, the stuff I learned in that class was invaluable. It’s simple, but useful. 


1) identify your triggers. All smokers have habits for their use like any addict. For most of us they are things like getting in the car to drive, we light up. Finish a meal, we light up. Get done with work, we light up etc. You have to identify your triggers and voice them in your own head (just to say you basically need to admit “I know x is a trigger for me to smoke”) that way it becomes easier not to let that action trigger your habit. You start telling yourself, “I know I’m getting in the car in 15, but I’m not going to let that interfere with NOT smoking today. 


2) don’t smoke while using the patch or gum. It’s medically very dangerous for you, but those tools also take some of the burden/responsibility for quitting off of you. You can say “oh man, I’d love to smoke but I put my patch on. Oh well, I don’t even have the choice today. 


3) it is an addiction, and some experts argue it is one of the most profoundly addictive substances. Just because you aren’t stealing from people to support your “habit” doesn’t mean that your brain is on your side, it’s not. Your brain is actively trying to get that sweet, sweet, stinky nicotine like Sméagol trying to get his precious back. Help take your brain out of the equation by planning ahead. Address your triggers, set yourself up for success, and you can free yourself from having to internally debate “should I smoke today”. You will start waking up thinking “not today, Satan. Not today...”


4) accept that you will most likely fail a few times. It can be days between smokes, or it could be years. We don’t really rid ourselves of addiction, we just stop indulging our addictions through hard work and will. Setting yourself up for success is just as important or more than having strong will-power. It’s okay to have setbacks, they’re part of the process. Just recommit to quitting as soon as you can and realize your relapse has no bearing on whether or not you will smoke again today, or tomorrow. Nothing in this process makes you a bad person. 


5) Be humble. The only thing worse than smoking is quitting. It’s a fight, quite literally a fight for your life. It’s okay to ask for help. Friends can be a VERY helpful weapon in your arsenal. Tel the people close to you that you really want to quit. Tell your roommates, coworkers, and family. Our addict brains try to create fallbacks and safe spaces so we can always turn back to smoking if we want. The old saying goes “no quarter for prisoners.” Don’t give your addiction a place to live, tell anyone and everyone who will listen that you are finished smoking so they can help hold you accountable. You will feel shame if you tell a coworker you quit, then they catch you smoking two days later. Sometimes we need those motivations, that shame, to get us over that initial hump. 

I’m 10 years nicotine free and could not be happier. You have really good things in store for you, you just have to get through the suck first. Best of luck to you!!!"
"E cigs are the way to go. Didn't go full autist with the culture, just got a good mod weened myself of the nicotine and now I can't even smoke cigs. The crazy fruit flavors make a regular cig taste like straight ass these days. Smoked for 5 yeas half pack to pack a day."
Pot helps
"I vaped.
It allowed me to still have the physical habit of ‘smoking’ and the hot and everything. After a while I began to gradually decrease the nicotine level of my juices down to zero. A short while after that, after maintaining the habit and losing the nicotine dependence I just naturally stopped, didn’t need it anymore!"
"Find a hobby that is exercise related. Eventually you will come to the point that your lungs hate you such much, you have to pick a side and it will become clear. Hopefully. Good luck! "
"Evidently, going into a coma does it!

My grandfather is about 78 years old and started smoking when he was 13. (Can you even imagine? Hell.) About five years ago now, his aorta burst in the middle of the night. It became a fight to save his life, a major heart surgery, and a ten day coma.

He woke up, and while he's not doing the best today, he's still alive... and hasn't smoked since. Not because he wanted to give it up, but had not a single urge since going into the coma."
"This might be so vain, but the reason I quit was wrinkles.  I was getting wrinkles in my lips.  On my face!  And my teeth were hard to keep white.  I hated the fact I was getting smoker's mouth.  I smoked for almost 20 years but quit in less than a month with patches."
"Sounds like BS but when I only thought of it as quitting smoking I always failed. When I realized I really wanted to be a non-smoker, as in that's the identity I want to have, I was able to stick to it. "
"I quit cold turkey in 2015, had a girl that I wanted to date and convinced myself that I would be more desirable if I didn't smoke and that she would like me better. That was my goal, set a goal. As others have said, sunflower seeds are good too! You have to find a reason that you want to quit, that reason might be different for everyone. Also, that girl and I got married in April, so I would say things worked out pretty great."
"For me, before I went cold turkey, I decided I need to break the chain of what I call ""event driven smoking"".  If you really want to quit, stop the habitual stuff.  A smoke when you get in the car, when you leave the office, on the way to lunch, when you drink beer, after a meal, at a certain break time, etc.  Move your cigarette times around so it's not based on anything, or quit one of those smokey treat times as a start and go from there.  It makes it a lot easier to quit when you decide to quit. "
"Two rules did it for me over time.

#1, Don't ever accept that you will always smoke. Always keep in your head that you WILL quit.

#2, Try to think about how it feels to smoke, before and after.  And what you did while you were smoking.



"
"Just quit. Seriously, have some integrity. If you want to quit, quit. If you don't, don't. That's the same thing I told myself and it seems to work. 

Hardest part is on the occasion you have a few drinks you're gonna want to smoke. I haven't figured that part out yet, might have to abstain from alcohol completely. "
"If you are not successful try again.  Each subsequent time you try to quit, you are more likely to actually do it.  "
Basic military training definitely did it for me.

"Instead of taking cigarette breaks, I would take Dum-Dum breaks.  They last about the same time as a cigarette and your body does the same hand-to-mouth motion.  In part my cravings were satisfied by keeping the pageantry of the cigarette break and it was enough to get me through the day until I didn't think about smoking as much.  15 years later and I still crave a smoke every once and a while, but it's easy to push aside."
"I have a few tips that are super effective, and have worked for me and a few others I've helped. Choose what works for you and also make your own up as you go.

1. Identify how many cigarettes you smoke per day. Number is key. Also identify exactly when you smoke each cigarette. This will help you determine exactly when you crave a smoke. Again, quantification is key!

2. Cut it down by half, and not just that, regulate your timings. If you smoke 10 a day, just smoke 5. And smoke them at regular intervals. Your body forms a new habit. Now continue, till you reach 2 a day, and just stop.

3. Identify stress based triggers or any other triggers, and at that time, just do something else, like walk, listen to music, breathe deeply. Shifting your mind off smoking is key here.

4. Finally, and this is important from day one of quitting, start exercising. It helped me immensely. Not only did I quit smoking, but I also got fitter much faster than I would have. Overall stress levels and triggers also went down.

The more religiously your follow all steps, especially in conjunction with no. 4, the faster you'll quit, and healthier you'll become, for good! Stay strong!

"I haven't smoked in about 13 years, but I never beat my addiction to nicotine.  I still buy nicotine gum.  If I don't have nicotine, I end up becoming incredibly agitated and depressed.  I did manage to beat a meth addiction and a heroin addiction, but not nicotine.  I'm cool with using the gum because it won't give me cancer or emphysema.  The only other tip I can offer is: don't drink alcohol.  To avoid a behavior, you need to have your wits.  Alcohol takes away your wits.  I haven't had a drink in 20 years because of this.  I don't want to end up smoking cigs or using drugs again, so alcohol is a no-no."
"dipping works for me, i dip pouches to get off smoking, after a couple of days i won’t wanna do either "
"I calculated how much I was spending a day in cigarettes (about $10 a day) and put that amount in my dresser drawer at the end of every day that I didn't smoke. Whenever I started feeling the urge, I would open my drawer and see a stack of tens.

I also wrote down all the reasons why I wanted to quit - didn't want to risk getting sick really young, wanted to be able to hike without being out of breath again, was tired of perpetually having a cold. I put the list in my wallet so I could read it whenever I felt the urge.

I also used the nicotine patch. It worked wonders to get rid of the physical addiction.

Lastly...don't beat yourself up if you slip a little. Just make sure you get back on track ASAP. Slipping up doesn't mean that quitting is pointless."
To be honest I just stopped. No easy way about it. Just walk away and dont do it. You are responsible for putting that to your own lips. Nobody forces you but the excuses you make for why you are having one.
Do it cold turkey! If you can survive 21 days without a cigarette I promise you you'll be done. Once you come to hate the smell of cigarette smoke you'll know you're done for good.
"For me it was feeding the oral fixation and having something to do with my hands. I chewed a shit ton of gum, nicotine at first and then eventually just regular gum, and had a little switch to flip with my hand when I got anxious. Now I have a fidget cube, which I'd strongly suggest."

"I read the boom of allen carr, quit smoking. It helped me a lot. Ive smoked a pack a day for 10 years. I read the book and quit. That was 3 years ago. "
I just used a substitute spray and only took it when I seriously needed it. Made a solid plan at the start too about how much I would cut it down each week
"Realize that is is tough, it's something that you have probably been doing habitually for quite some time. Find something else to 'replace' it. I say 'replace' because nothing ever truly will, and the desire to smoke isn't totally diminished because you just ran 3 miles. 
 A few things that helped me.. 1) Exercise, and realizing that smoking is only hindering my athletic performance, 2) Leveraging the time that I have already made it not smoking. Its always easy to take a smoke from a mate, but when you tell yourself ""hey, I've been smoke free for 5 full days, don't fuck it up now"" it really helps you see the progress you've made, 3) Learn to beat the craving. Most cravings last for 15-20 min and if you can out last that, you'll see that you don't need that smoke, it's just the addiction rearing it's ugly head. 
You have to want to quit as well, for your health or for your loved ones sake. It helps to think of things that are more important than smoking, and use that as fuel to keep off the smokes. Be proud of your accomplishments, no matter how small. Any time not smoking is something to be proud of. Keep at it!

There has been research that showed quitting cold turkey is better than gradual quitting. Good luck OP!
"For me, finding a nicotine alternative worked very well. I started with a Juul and eventually ended up getting a vape mod for lower nic juice. 10 months smoke free now."
Get bronchitis then you can’t smoke for that weaning time you need lol. That’s what happened to me.
"Smoke/nicotine free for 4 years. What worked for me was creating a ritual around smoking then omitting the smoking. 

Every night I would go for a very short run (1/2 mile to a mile, I now run many many miles!!). Get home shower. Then sit down with a glass of wine or a beer and have my one cigarette of the day. After a few weeks I cut out the cig, then the wine, then my ritual just became running, especially when I’d have a craving.

I think for me it worked because I looked forward to the ritual all day and it made that cigarette special. Cutting it out wasn’t that hard after a while as it wasn’t the main great thing about that hour. 

The running also had an impact because I could see the physical benefits of cutting out smoking by way of distance and ease of the run. Though it took me years of running to get to the point I am now!!

Good luck!"
"I smoked a pack+ a day for 12 years. I did the patch. I tried doctor prescribed medicines. I tried gum. Nothing seemed like it was working but I eventually quit cold turkey. It was not easy.

I had massive muscle cramps in my legs that made it difficult for me to walk at times. I would get nauseous and start vomiting. I'd get anxious when I heard doors open, I'd feel lost after meals. It was terrifying at times. 

What got me through it all? What was worth all of this torture and pain?

I wanted children, and I wanted to be able to run and play with them.  I quit smoking 7 years ago. My son is 6 and likes to play quietly in his room or read books. He's not too into sports at the moment.. My 3-year old daughter gets tired on short walks around the block and insists I carry her around.

**It was still worth it.** 

You need a reason to quit. Something that will become your mantra as you endure a struggle to change every aspect of your life. The longer you've smoked, the more rituals you've developed based around smoking. These rituals are all subtle triggers that you will need to reprogram. The stronger your connection to your goal, the stronger your will will be to change them and be a better you. 

It isn't easy. Good luck!"
"Cold Turkey. Think about the nasty shit it’s doing to your insides, and outsides. I scared myself off them thinking about my health. And don’t put yourself around friends who smoke. Wait until you hit the threshold where you can actually decline them to hang back out with them. Friends who smoke while you’re trying to quit suck. They generally don’t have your best interests in mind and wish they could quit but they don’t really want to. People wear smoking and the ‘lack of ability to quit smoking’ as a badge of honor. It’s disgusting. People wear their ‘years of service’ to cigarettes as the same badge of honor. “Oh, you quit after only two years of smoking, cute. I’ve been smoking for 10 years. I just can’t quit.” Those people don’t want to quit. There’s a sick bravado in it for them. "
"Start smoking your first one later and later in the day.

&#x200B;

Your body spends all day trying to catch up with the ""fix"" from the first cigarette. If you start later, you'll spend less time chasing it. I started pushing it back 15 minutes every few days. So 9Am->9.15->930 etc.

At one point I wasn't having a smoke until after 5PM and I was only having a few a day. It was a lot easier to just walk away then. 

  
I quit 22 years ago and there have been more than a few times where I have really wanted one, but after about 2 or 3 weeks, it was a lot easier to resist.

&#x200B;

Good luck!"
"You have to be ready to quit, for one. 

We used monq pens until they ran out, that helped. The lavender helps calm you, or whatever flavor you choose. 

Also cinnamon toothpicks helped me, my wife never tried em. 

My wife is also super into crystals and their metaphysical properties (which is oddly understandable even though it sounds batshit). We both drank a ""Crystal Elixir"", which was water, amethyst, and botswana agate. Let em sit over night, drink it (sans crystals) in the morning. Don't know if that did the trick, but I havent had a cig since.

To all you teens out there: Not starting is the best way of quitting.
There was a website I often referred to called whyquit.com.  Had a day by day explanation of what to expect that was pretty accurate.  I'd recommend cold turkey.
"Vaping. Started with the stuff as strong as cigarettes and slowly worked the amount of nicotine down over a few months until I got to zero. Eventually charging batteries and filling the tiny tanks got to be more hassle than it was worth and I just left it with a dead battery. 

It was my brother in law’s idea, worked for him too. 

Tip: Don’t go for the flavors that try to taste like cigarettes, find something timeless that you enjoy like coffee or mint flavored. "
"A friend told me he had just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and had six months to live. I gave him the rest of my pack and went cold turkey. That was 18 years ago. I had smoked for 9 years.   
 
For the first two years it was quite hard. I enjoyed hanging around with smokers and getting second hand smoke. But that lessened as I went on. I'm now quite anti smoking. It smells awful and really is quite disgusting so I stay away from people who smoke. It gets a lot easier.  "
"niquitin 4mg mini losengers are the GOAT for quitting smoking.

I don't know if I ever will quit nicotine though."
Don’t pick up another cigarette ever again.
"Honestly, I found that when I was craving a smoke, my breathing was very shallow and short. When I focused on taking long, deep breaths, my cravings went away. I went cold turkey from 1.5 packs a day, 2 packs a day on weekends for 8 years. Haven't looked back since. It's been 7 years since I quit. "
"Simply decided to stop buying them, then get a hobby"
"This is what did it for me after smoking a 1/2 pack a day for almost 20 years.

1. Wait til you get a cold (cigs taste less than great when you're sick).

2. Get the patch - it helped me

3 Get nicotine gum - for a while.

4. Most important: you have to change the memory of a cigarette in your brain.  Remember what it tastes like when you first tried it - not like it does when you've had a few cocktails, etc."
"I am 35 years old, I quit several times. I have been smoke free for two years and I will never go back. Why? I have gum disease. And it’s quite visible which side of my mouth I used to smoke from. My gums have receded higher in the place I used to have my cigaret dangling. That really made me think, what the hell am I doing to myself?"
"""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" By Allen Carr. I am 10 months smoke free after 16 years. I had tried countless times before but always failed, whether it was due to some stressor or finally having a drink, there was always an excuse to go back. Even when I made it a few months, I still felt like I was going to have to live my life feeling like I was missing out on something that brought me joy! This was my last ditch effort before I resigned myself to always being a smoker. It sounds too good to be true, I get that, but it works! Please just try it. Even if you feel like it wont work. Just read it. It's life changing. "
"Get pregnant, not available to most redditors"
I stopped many times but quit?... after about the 100th time stopping I finally just went cold turkey. The first day is tough. the first week is harder. If you can get past that the rest is just continued will power for the rest of your life just not as often as time progresses.
"I honestly bought a vape and just used the 2mg juice in it for about a month, eventually the coils on the vape starting burning out waaay too fast and that gross off-taste was enough for me to put that down too."
"I smoked for about 13 years, tried quitting and failed like 3 times. I decided i would try and quit when my stress was at an all time low, i saw the moment and jumped on it and it worked. I was running a construction job and we were wildly succesful so i had two weeks on site where my crew was done before everybody else, so i was there in case i was needed. I have been smoke free for 3 years now. Id recommend taking a vacation maybe and using it to try and quit, i truly believe the lack of stress was the main factor that helped me."
i ate chocolate when i craved a cigarette.  Eventually i just wanted more and more chocolate.
"taper down:  
  
First spend some time to get a feel for how many you smoke a day.  
  
Now each week subtract that number by one.  
  
Once you get down to like 2 cigs a day stretch it out to two weeks.  
  
Then finally when you get down to 1 cig do it for a week then commit to 0 for two weeks.  
  
The first couple days suck but after that it really isn't that bad.  
  
Also try to ""replace"" it with something more healthy.  
  
For me I took non-smoke smoke breaks with some coffee.  
  
Best advice I can give though is listen to everyone's advice, try different things until you find what works for you."
"Keep that last pack.  Write ""LAST PACK"" and the date it was finished on the pack itself with a big silver or other highly visible sharpie.  Keep that pack in a place where you will see it EVERY DAY, preferably several times a day.  Mine is on my bedside table so the very first and last thing I see every day is that last pack I finished 3 months ago.  I've had cravings since I quit like everybody else but the image of that pack and that date are burned into my mind now and I can't make all that for nothing."
"1. Stop smoking.
2. Don't be a bitch and get through the three days after.
3. Replace it with masturbation or sex.
Never smoke again. Not even one."
"Give yourself a simple pros and cons list. (I’m formerly a 2-pack-a-week on average smoker for the past 10 years, coming up on one year being smoke free and I feel great)

If anything, I miss the social part, the complement it was for drinking and de-stressing...  But that’s it. 

If I could go back in time and tell myself it was never really worth it, I would.

Less to carry, less to spend, less anxiety about health effects, ...less to worry about how I smell.
More self respect, better stamina during exercise, better physical appearance.

Some smokers would give me the “you were never really hooked” but IMO, it really is a personal scale of habit to will-power."
Sunflower seeds. Keep your oral fixation fixed
"Pack a day since high school, about fifteen years.  Blue E-cig came out around 2012.  Started on those, mixed with the occasional regular cig.  Went to the blues only.  No satisfaction from the blue at all.  Quit both entirely over six years ago, with zero slips!"
"Me and my ex used to share Camels every time we'd hang out. This went on for about 3 years. After a nasty break-up, I just stopped smoking altogether. It wasn't hard, I just stopped. Drinking, on the other hand, increased exponentially. It was only until recently that I finally kicked that habit too."

Think of all the money you could save
Don’t be a bitch 
"In October I decided to quit smoking on new year. At the end of November I bought enough cigarettes (smoking for about 35 years makes you know how much you smoke a day) to last me until new year. I removed every ashtray and peripheral. I did save one astray and one lighter then placed the pile of cigarettes beside it. Every time I smoked I was looking at the cigarettes telling my self ""that's all I have to smoke when it's gone it's over"". I psyched my self for a month and at new year I grabbed the ashtray and lighter, walked out and tossed it in the trash.

The following 3 months was the worst time of my life. If someone had robed me at gunpoint I'd plead with him to kill me. I did get thru it and now 3.9 years later I'm doing fine. My cravings stopped less then a year after. Every now and then the brain tell you ""Psst hey you haven't smoked for so long it's likely you won't like it, test one and lets see if it's true!"". Every time that happens you have to be strong and say NO! fuck that, I'm not going true that again.

Good luck out there on quitting."
Live in Canada and dont smoke in your house 
"Cold turkey. It sucks for a few weeks, but it gets easier. I found that it’s easier to count the days of you quit cold turkey, rather than weaning yourself. Being able to say “it’s been 3 months, two weeks and three days since my last cigarette!” Is an accomplishment and I don’t want to ruin my streak! 

Also, I got a Juul from the gas station. It satisfies the nicotine craving, smells and tastes a hell of a lot better, I can puff on it in my house with no ill effects and it ended up being cheaper ($15 for 4 Juul pods, I go through a pod every day or two, versus $8 per pack that I would go through in the same amount of time)"
When you start getting those withdrawal sweats hit the gym or the sauna
just say no and stay strong
"You need to find a real reason for which you are stopping, I was able to stop by pure will in a single day when I finally found my reason, because smoking would be dis-respecting it. Just saying I wanted it before was not enough, because nothing was holding me accountable if I slipped."
Get a juul
"You gotta run the treadmill or smoke weed when your feeling overwhelmed. Can't do either? Suck it up til you can. Quitting is not easy but do you really want to be a slave to a habit you don't even have any benefit from? Show that you're not as weak willed as most the people around you. You can do it. Also, drink lots and lots of water and flush your system. "
"The best way I can explain it, is that one day I decided I was no longer a smoker, I just didnt do it. Regardless of how I felt or what I thought, I just didnt smoke anymore. That worked for me. One day I decided I was a non smoker."
"I told myself that the next time I got a sick (like a cold) I would not smoke. It happened to coincide with lack of money. So I got sick, had no cigarettes, and had no money. I had a hit off my sisters cigarette 3 months later and hated it. I haven't had smoked in 3 years and I have 0 cravings. I do sometimes feel like I am forgetting something but no actual cravings. 

I do sometimes have dreams that I picked it up again and wake up in a panic that I am smoking again just to realize I still don't.

TL;DR: told myself to not smoke next time, got sick and broke at the same time so quit smoking. Haven't had a cigarette for 3 years."
"For me I just quit buying them. If I could fight the urge to get in the truck and drive to the store then I didn't have any. I went through a period where I would buy some and think I'll only get them if I really need one. If you have them handy.. you will smoke them.   
Fight the urge to buy them and you won't have any to smoke.  
Also break it down into managable chunks of time. Just get to lunch without one... Good... now just get to 5:00 without one.. make it through dinner... one before bed? Nope.. and boom your 24 hrs in  


Make it to 3 days and it gets so much easier."
I went the Chantix route. Didn’t have any problem quitting and have not really been seriously tempted in nearly 5 years now. It is pretty powerful and i experienced some aggressive behavior towards the end (3 months) and really crazy dreams the whole time. 
"Have a plan. Don’t just say you’re gonna quit bec you never will.

I quit with a vape. I started my nicotine at 22 ml potency and djaled it back 1 ml a month until I got to zero. Took me two years but it’s worked."
Instead of 2 packs a day i started with 4 that helped a lot for me.
Calculated the money i would save and thought of benefits with regards to health and breath. Quit cold turkey and just sticked to it
"Just keep quitting. It's easy to get discouraged when you slip up, having to reset the ""days since our last incident"" calendar in your head."
Do it cold turkey and try to have the mindset that you never smoked in the first place I quit after 10 years. Started when I was 13.
"Start using an e-cig for about 3 months. Then just stop. For me, it was way easier to quit just nicotine than all the other crap in a cigarette."
"15-minute rule worked great for me. Nicotine cravings last only 15 minutes, then they subside. They may be back 5 minutes later if you are a heavy smoker who is quitting cold turkey, but every time you don't smoke, the span of time in between cravings gets a little longer. Just do something engaging for that 15 minutes. I found that exercise or sex/masturbation worked the best to get my mind off it. 

The first 48 hours were the worst, especially at night when I was trying to sleep. My first time quitting, I had sweats at night that I couldn't hack, so I caved and bought some, chain smoked a few, then slept like a baby. The final time I quit, I didn't kid myself with delusions of strength or will power - I bought some sleeping pills and knocked myself out 2 nights in a row. Much easier. 4.5 years later, still smoke free! "
I stopped being around people who smoke. Then just stopped smoking abruptly. The sight of cigs is a great way to keep smoking. I smoked half a pack daily for 5+ years and then just stopped. It's been 3 years since I smoked. 
"Pot.  
Ensure you have three - preferably four - days where you can not be worth a shit. Wake & bake. And everytime you wanna smoke a cig, take a toke. By the fourth day, you're over it. The nicotine is mostly gone by that point. Four days. It's also helpful if your fam, S.O., roommates, whoever, are aware of your purging, but not constantly asking the whole ""how's it going"" kinda questions. Stay in the fog, & once it lifts it's a whole new horizon!  
The real issue is the re-entry, going to the pub, taking a break at work, what to do while you're ""waiting,"" waiting for the bus, or your friend to pick you up, or whatever. I enjoy pistachios, sunflower seeds, breathing... I hope this helps, I went 30 yrs. and I want a cigarette every day, and every day is one more I likely would not have had if I still smoked!"

"I was smoking a few a day in college. I also was getting into running and training for a 10 miler. What made me quit, after many, many attempts at quitting. I actually gave up quitting and was like, oh well.. ill be a smoker for a bit longer. What made me quit, was after an 8 mile run, all I could think of was smoking a cigarette and wanting a cigarette badly. Finally, I get back from teh run.. out of breath, red faced and dying. I go to my room, grab a smoke, go outside and smoke it.. it proceeds to be the worst cigarette I have ever had in my life. Along with being out of breath, I felt incredibly horrible and stopped for a long time after that. Now, I do very very rarely"
I used the gum for about a week. Didn't even think about having one because I was getting the nicotine. Then I had to sort of trick myself. I convinced myself that I had already quit smoking and that quitting gum wouldn't be hard. It worked and I haven't had nicotine in over four years. 
"I went to Delhi on holiday.

Tried to have a smoke as normal, lungs turned themselves inside out and told me to go f\*\*k myself.

Got home, couldn't smoke anymore.

"Frequented r/stopsmoking which led to The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Our Father Allen Carr. That book was the key to get me in the right mindset and the first thing I suggest to people who want to quit. Used the app Smoke Free to keep me straight and put things into perspective. During the thick of it, chewing straws, snacking on veggie straws and baby carrots, chugging water, and paying attention to how my body was changing and improving stopped me from giving in to cravings. 1 year, 8 months since my last cigarette. I don't even know why I ever smoked at this point and I have zero desire to go back to it. Waking up not feeling like my chest is on fire is pretty cool, and I have the nose of a bloodhound. Still get winded when I work out but that's a me problem..."
i fell off the wagon after years of not smoking. stress has gotten to me lately. 
Wife made me do it. Smoke free since december. Went cold turkey one day and that was it. 
"Find a smoker that you don't like. Karen, the annoying coworker, or Jacob, the prententious hipster. Channel your hate. Refuse to smoke because you're better than them. Every time you get an urge, remind yourself that those fuckers are gonna die before you do. If they ask you to join them for a smoke, laugh to yourself as they walk alone, dragging the ball and chain of addiction. You want to stop at the gas station and grab a pack? You'll be able to afford a nice vacation in a matter of months while they will be financially crippled by addiction. You're better than them and don't ever forget it. "
Honestly the biggest thing was I stopped hanging out with other people that smoke. In a social bubble by myself it was easy not to smoke but then I'd go hang out with someone that did and I'd inevitably bum one off of them.
"When I quit in 2001 I personally found it helpful to replace the hand-to-mouth ""ritual"" with carrot sticks cut to the length of cigarettes.  I was told the hardest part to quit was ""the ritual"" of it all, it's a psychological comfort as well as a physical addiction, but your body gets over the physical addiction surprisingly quickly (about a month I believe), behaviours take longer to change.  So I used to still go outside on my work break with my carrot stick and stand there and slowly munch on it at the rate I would have smoked a cigarette, breathing in slowly as I did.  It might sound dumb, but it worked for me.  Eventually just going out for a breath of fresh air was enough."
Reading the Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Alan Carr and visiting r/stopsmoking worked for me. I don’t think anyone could read Alan Carr’s book without quitting even if they wanted to continue to smoke. I read it as a skeptic just kind of wanting to quit. Been about 8 years now and never missed smoking for a minute. 
"Vaping can make quitting fairly easy since you can control the dosage of nic. Start with 24mg or so for a few weeks. Then step down to 12mg for a few weeks. Then 6, then 3.

At first vaping sucks and all you can think about is how much better a cig is. But eventually you will come around and it will be fine, or in some cases people end up liking it even more. And during the whole process you will still be getting nic, but not any of the other garbage that's in cigs. 

There's a lot of ways to quit, but I think vaping may be the easiest. "
Stay away from other smokers
"Just do it. Seriously. I hated that I was smoking and I couldn’t take not breathing anymore, so I threw my new pack of smokes into the fireplace and watched them burn. Been two years next month. 
It takes discipline, endurance and resolve like other commenters have already said. You’ll never be truly ready. Just dooooo itttttt"
"For me it was a matter of deciding that I wanted to quit. Not because of what other people thought, simply decide that I did not want to smoke anymore. The rest was easy."
"Recognize that if you continue smoking that odds are that something bad to your health could happen. For me, my mother died from lung cancer before she was 60. It's a painful death and while there are no guarantees that if you quit, it won't happen, but don't you want to improve your odds?

There is nothing cool about smoking. People hate smokers! Why do you want to be part of a hated group that you voluntarily join?

Smoking is expensive. Can't you use the money for other things?

Bottom line though, YOU HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT!!! It has to be your genuine desire. That s most of it. "
"TBH, I stopped smoking cigarettes by substituting with weed whenever I got the urge for a month or two. Then scaling back on the weed was way easier than tobacco.  Obviously this method won't work for many but I was fortunate enough at the time to be working a menial job where being stoned didn't matter.  Now, that plan wouldn't work at all."
"Do whatever it takes. I had to use chantix. Remember, you have to change how you think about certain. Frustrated a little at work, no more smoke break. It will get easier but the first week after i quit, people told me i was a bear. I had to relearn how to be frustrated and mad."
"Get a vape, ween yourself down to .2 % nicotine, and then take a week long vacation somewhere you can relax and don't take your vape.
Used to smoke half a pack a day, haven't had nicotine in 2 years.
Obviously *results may vary* but I feel, with most addictions, willpower is 95% of the battle, and if you really want to quit, you can."
Wellbutrin really helped me. I was already on it for depression. When I decided to quit I didn’t have physical cravings. Like at all. I was confused until I figured out that it was the Wellbutrin. I still had to overcome the mental addiction but it was SO much easier without the physical withdrawal. 
"Try various replacements. Get rid of your cigs add lights, as instead of smoking, use a nicorette inhaler, you pull on it just the same as a normal cig but it doesn't smell. When you've been on the inhaler a few weeks, use the spray. It gives you a great hit, and breaks the hand to mouth movement habit. Once you feel like the replacements are all you need, start chewing the gum, just find a flavour that you enjoy. After a while, you'll hate the smell of tobacco and you'll have minty fresh breath while you get your kick. Eventually, take a piece of normal gum instead of the nicotine gum, and gradually repeat this more frequently to reduce your nicotine levels, then try a day with no nicotine at all, just normal gum. If you can't, don't worry, just have a nicotine gum and try again the next day. Eventually, you'll get to a point where when you need a boost you'll just have a piece of normal gum and the craving will disappear."
"Chain smoking until I threw up fixed a decade of cancer sticks. I also had the flu at the time, which expedited the vomiting. I'll never forget that taste as long as I live."
"Stay away from your smoking friends for a few months at least. Don't drink alcohol for a couple months. Sleep whenever you can for the first week. Drink lots of water.

I quit cold turkey it whe only thing that worked for me. 

Also no you cannot have ""just one because you haven't had one all day"""
"**Good luck, OP, you can do it!!! Join the ex-smokers club with me!**

COLD TURKEY.  I tried multiple crutches: (gum, patches, lozenges, wellbutrin) all failed. I wasted years of my life (15 to be exact) and countless dollars. One won't quit smoking until one is *truly* ready. When that time comes, and one is committed, simply \*stop smoking\*. Just choose a day to start your smoke free life and enjoy not being a prisoner to smelly fingers and clothes, premature aging, emphysema, etc... It worked for me and I have little to no will power, which is why being mentally prepared and committed is so important."
"Make sure you do a proper goodbye to smoking. That is, treat it like a relationship ending, because in many ways it is. It's like cutting a toxic friend out of your life. You need to acknowledge that there will be a sense of loss and allow yourself to experience that. Then cut all ties and walk away."
In the process right now. I find it’s easier when you have someone else to quit with. Also bought a vaping pen. Went from 6 packs a week down to 1 ^.^
I honestly found it relatively easy. I had a weekend where I smoked waaaaay too much. I woke up on Monday feeling like a car was on my chest and I was all out of cigarettes. Given the feeling in my chest it was easy to not smoke that day. I woke up Tuesday and didn't think about a cigarette all day. Then on Wednesday I thought about it and realized I should just keep it going because the urge wasn't immense. I'm not smoke free for eight months.
For me it was milestones. Make it the first day. Then make it the first week. Then 2 weeks. It was all downhill for me after 2 weeks. 
"Enter Shia Labouf screaming ""Just deeewwww it!!!"""
I got a pretty severe case of reflux acid which in turn led me to have my first panic attack because I thought my heart was failing. Wasn't hard to quit after that.
Have a doctor look you over.
"Get a vape and start off with the normal nicotine levels and slowly decrease until you’re vaping the nicotine free juice

Find something else to fill in your cravings.
20 crunches or pushups instead of a cigarette. This ones a lot harder to stick to. 

Or the trick that worked for me. Move to a city where they’re stupid expensive with brutal winters. I quit when I ran out and realized I had to walk a couple blocks through a blizzard to waste $15."
"Nicotine patches did it for me. Vaping just turned into another addiction. Patches give a constant dose of nicotine throughout the day and cut down in increments. I also cut patches in half to half the dosage near the end too. Not really ""supposed"" to do that, but I did it anyway.

Just don't go to sleep with them on. I did a couple times, nicotine interferes with REM sleep and you get some crazy dreams "
Get Bronchitis 
"Smoked contraband *kretek* cigarettes and then the government started to tighten up the security and I could no longer find them easily. Smoked less and less, and one day I realised I hadn't smoked for a few days. Tried to see if I could make it to a month just to brag about it. Then it became two months. Then it became almost five years now.

Looking back I was very busy during those days, so ultimately (as is the case with many tasks that on the surface require a ton of willpower) what will really get the job done is an ample amount of distraction."
"Pregnancy. I wanted to quit almost as soon as I started smoking but, well, we know how addictions happen. As soon as I saw the positive test I was done. Crossing my fingers it sticks after the bubs is born."
"Don't beat yourself up if you try to quit and fail. Just try again, however many times it takes until you are successful. Worked for me.
 Eventually."
"I vaped before vaping was cool.  I committed to vaping for 24 hours and then when I lit a cig, the taste was utterly horrible.  I did start at the highest nicotine level and brought it down here and there.  I vaped for a good two years until I ran out of batteries and couldn't vape for a couple of days and then decided I was done with it since I was going to a family reunion and they would have made fun of me for vaping.  lol.  I smoked for over 20 years and when I substituted the vape for the cigs I was at a pack a day."
I did the weening method. Allow myself x per day for a couple weeks. Then gradually get lower until you're on like 1 or 2 then you really don't want it.
"You have to want to quit, there are lots of tips and tricks to help, but if you don't want to quit you're always going to fail.  

That said, I worked it out of my routine and set guidelines around when I was allowed to smoke.  E.g. I used to always light up whenever I got in the car, always after a meal, whenever I had my morning coffee... etc.  First I got rid of those and only smoked when I really needed it.  That cut me back over a month or so to 4-5 cigarettes a day.  From there I switched to the lozenges and cut back to eventually nothing.  The lozenges were good to take the crazy out of the cravings when you get them.  You can control the dosage of nicotine in the lozenges as well, so it's easy to monitor and decrease the dose over time.  Then eventually you just don't do it anymore. "
"This probably sounds like a dumb reason to quit, but I got tired of the need to buy cigarettes and cigars all the time. Not necessarily the cost, but the need to stop in to another store to replenish my supply. 

&#x200B;

It was a process. I replaced cigarettes and clove cigars by switching to vaping. After a couple years, started to reduce the amount I vaped, and then at some point, realized that I hadn't touched the vape in 3-4 days. At that point, it was like, well, guess that means I quit. Smoked a clove on vacation a couple months ago, and didn't even enjoy it.

&#x200B;

Definitely not a process that will work for everyone, but after somewhere around 6 months off, it must have worked for me."
"My granny just stopped, overnight, she just said she didnt want to smoke anymore.
My dad smokes from a young age (13) and he smoked up until my older brother was about to be born, and my sister was still less than a few weeks. He said he didnt want his bad decision to affect us, and he says it the greatest decision hes ever made"
"I had started smoking weed, and I ran out of butts on the way home from work where I would normally smoke 2. Decided I was going to see how long I could go before buying another pack. I had 1 on a camping trip the following weekend and haven’t since. The weed helped a lot. And some can argue its one ha it for another but I can’t tell you how much better I feel. "
"Do not make deals with yourself in regards to slipping one here or there just don't do it.  Altoids; keeps a medium sized thing in your pocket for the weight, when you reach you get a treat and not a cigarette.

&#x200B;"
"Don't have a spare pack lying around. I tried to quit multiple times and I would always have a spare one, I would tell myself ""just in case"" I had a really stressful day or was drinking with buddies or whatever reason. I would tell myself I'm just cutting down slowly, which was nice at the start but you have to make the jump and show commitment at some point. Once I made the decision not to buy anymore it became easy when I didn't have the temptation around. "
"Perhaps not the most experienced; 
But,I quit after 2 years by making the decision in my head I wasnt a smoker and then ending that night by getting sick off of cigarettes. 
Kinda rewired it for me. "
"My mother quit after being diagnosed with COPD in her 70's -- 60-year smoker. The damage is done, though. Any surgery she needs now has to be done WITHOUT general anesthesia because they can't keep her sufficiently oxygenated. "
"[This](https://whyquit.com/joel/index-guide.html) along with the [abundance of other material in ""Joel's library""](https://whyquit.com/joel/index.html) did the trick for me. 

[Here's a good, short article to get you started.](https://whyquit.com/joel/Joel_02_01_my_cig_my_friend.html) I read this years before I actually quite and it really stuck with me, nagging at me in the back of mind. "
"Once I remove myself from situations where I would normally be smoking the rest pretty much came naturally. remove the situations where you smoke, remove people that smoke around you, remove the triggers that would cause you to smoke or replace smoking in those scenarios with something else."
"I smoked for over 10 years. How I quit smoking cigarettes was to stop going out with friends that smoke and stop drinking any alcoholic beverages. Basically no more social fun with friends for awhile!!! 
Also think of new ways to stay busy. I’d say this is going to change your life style for next 6-12 months if you do decide to quit.
Good luck and stay strong!!"
Actually wanting to stop. As well as realizing that the positives does not outweigh the negatives. 
"Start weightlifting. I did, and while I've started and stopped smoking a couple times since then. I typically have been non-smoking for longer than smoking."
"I struggled for years to quit.  Did cold turkey, acupuncture, and just cold hard will power.  Nothing worked until I tried welbutran.  It's an antidepressant that people were stopping without intending to stop.  

Basically you set your date 3 weeks out and start taking it.  By three weeks I found I'd cut my habit in half already.  I quit without either cravings or massive mood swings.  After a few months you stop the welbutran.

The only downside was I gained a bunch of weight that took several years to lose...  

Go see your gp.   Then start exercising as part of your new life.

"
Use heroine 
Literally farts are more pleasing to the nose than a smoker's stench.
"Before you quit, smoke 3-4 cigarettes very quickly then try to remember that taste. Everytime you crave think back to that taste"
Salt on the tongue when I had cravings. 
"I started vaping at the highest strength and slowly cut the strength over 6 months to '0' nicotine, from day one I stopped smoking cigarettes and have been off both vaping and cigarettes for approx 4 years now and have no urge to restart either.

If you are going to try vaping I would recommend going with any flavour juice other than tobacco flavours to 'retrain' your taste."
I tried quitting and it worked. 
"Just quit cold turkey and do not smoke anything. It get easier every day a little bit, I tell you that.

Also when you have a cravings,  just go to breath some fresh air outside, you will notice that your brain can be tricked into thinking that you smoked already.

Good luck :). Smoke free more than 3 years already"
"Smoked Goto Kola, lobelia and mullen. Careful of lobelia, not for human consumption, can induce comas, similar to opiates. 

Wellbutrin generic is buspirone. Take the pill and keep smoking after a couple of weeks you don't feel like smoking. Then taper off of meds."
I vaped. Now to quit vaping lol
"I quit 4 years ago after I had a bad cold/flu.  I'd been trying to quit for years, but this time it stuck.  I'll be smoke free for 4 years in December.  The key for me was actually wanting to quit.  It's one thing to quit because it's healthy, or because someone wants you to, but it's a heck of a lot easier if you yourself actually want to quit.  "
"Lollipops. 

Smoking is an oral fixation and answering that need helped. Also, I don't really like lollipops, they last way too long, so it eventually got annoying enough to also quit the lollipops. "
"I would say start vaping, but since for most of all people smoke and vape are the same, i think this answer is not valid for you "
"0 nicotine vape did it for me. You get over the chemical addiction quickly but habit will get you. If you are like me you will be successful until you are at a bar with a friend who smokes. If you don't have your vape accessible at that moment then you will fail. If you solve that problem then you win.

Smoke free for three years now and lost my vape this year and it's never crossed my mind since. (My two and a half year old daughter plays a big role in my confidence in not going back to smoking)."
"Anybody who says they're ""cutting down / cutting back on cigarettes before quitting for good"" have no real intention of quitting. 

Cold Turkey or start back up next month. Your choice. "
"I quit smoking 9 days ago. I've had to literally bitch slap myself across the face to keep myself from buying a pack. 

That was day 1-7 though, the past couple days I've only had a couple small cravings that went away after 5 min. I even went to the gym and ran 7 miles the other day!

My recommendation is to just quit cold Turkey. Nicotine is evil and you only have to deal with the withdrawal for a short period.

"
"Give yourself a specific reason for wanting to quit.  Ask yourself why.

For me, I just couldn't stand the il-health any more.  The constant coughing and wheezing, being out of breath.  And I just didn't like the smoke and the ash any more.  With all that in mind quitting was easy."
"Get an e cigarette!

2 months smoke free now, and I feel great. 

"
"You have to be ready. If you’re not ready it’s going to be a lot harder to quit. Best advice I can give is keep yourself active when you quit. I don’t mean physical exercise, though that wouldn’t hurt, but do things around your house that will keep your mind off of having a cigarette long enough. Another thing that helped me continue not smoking is tracking the money I’ve saved by not smoking. "
"Might be buried but what worked for me was limiting when I could have one. I started by not letting myself smoke at home because I was watching my infant son. If I stepped out for a smoke and locked myself out of the house with him inside I never would ha e forgiven myself so I only smoked at work. Then after getting used to that, I stopped buying them. This meant that if I wanted one at work I had to bum one. After a while I stopped being that guy who was always bu.ming smokes and just quit. That was the scariest step."
"Probably gonna get hate for this because many Redditors seem to have a serious superiority complex on the subject, but the only thing that worked for me is vaping."
Get alcohol poisoning and start throwing up to the point your throat swells up and can't swallow anything for days. This is what I did and I have been smoke free for over 2 years.
"You gotta get yourself hooked on a different drug in order to quit.  I chew tobacco now which I eventually plan to quit.  At least, I'm spreading the cancer risk around to different parts of my body instead of concentrating it solely on my lungs."
Wait until you have a really nasty chest cold. The first drag is like a bottle brush swabbing out your throat and lungs. Good time to go cold turkey.
"Did it right before I was going to have an incredibly busy two weeks. When the two weeks were over I had enough time sunk into it to keep going.  Also, I have an app called “smoke free”. It logs how much time and money you’ve saved. It’s motivating. 

It also helped to actually want to quit. I’d quit before, but my heart wasn’t into it. When I finally did it I was sure. 

Good luck!  "
"I've been smoke-free for 9 years this coming November. This is how I did it.

First off: Don't quit smoking. **Stop**. ""Quit"" has many negative connotations, so it's seen as a negative for some of us. ""Stop,"" on the other hand, is more neutral.

Second: Don't keep a pack of smokes somewhere ""just in case."" Leaving yourself an out is just admitting you may not succeed in stopping.

Get yourself through the first week. It's a bitch, but that's about when the worst of the withdrawal will occur. Take it day-by-day, and gut it out.

I suggest doing it cold turkey. The withdrawal has acted as a negative reinforcement against starting back up.

Once you're past the first week, find something to keep your hands busy. Adjust to the new reality that you have a sense of smell and taste, and focus on how awesome they are. Don't stay away from smokers... realize that that's how **you** smelled when you were a smoker.

Above all, don't nag your friends who still smoke to quit, and don't evangelize about how awesome it is to be smoke-free. That's the kind of thing that pushes people not to stop."
"You have to want it and mean it. If this is the case  you just stop, keep stopping and stay stopped."
"Well, marijuana became legal in my state so I replaced one vice for another, but I smoke once or twice per day as opposed to 5-10 times.  Progress?"
"How I did it: It was a huge burden to my wallet and the high was not even anything special, so I just stopped one day cold turkey. First 3 days were annoying but not that hard as people make it to be. You just need to remember that you have free will and nothing is forcing you light that cigarette, it's all in your head, your body doesn't need it. Also, have a bunch of fruit with you and snack on that as a ""replacement"". Just remeber that you are not an animal and don't let something retarded like nicotine grasp you, you're stronger than that.

I have been cigarette free for about 10 months now, I don't plan on starting again ever. "
"I just quit cold turkey and whenever I wanted one for those first few days, I'd just tell myself that the triggers would fade and eventually dissappear along with the withdrawl headaches and cramps. Simple but it worked for me. The trick is to not give in. No ""one last smoke"" cause that's how you end up smoking one the next day, and two the day after and so on. It sucks, but nut up and just quit. The pain doesn't last forever. "
"You've got to really WANT to quit.  When I did, I was ready. Tossed half a pack of camel wides and never had another one.  I had quit before, and I'll warn ya, don't even think about having another drag or smoke at all.  I'd quit for a year once and had ONE drag off a cigarette and by the end of the day is bought my own pack.  As for this time, been 15 years this past July"
"I had stopped twice before and started cigarettes again, finally quitting successfully on the third attempt.

The reason for stopping has to be more important to you than the reason for continuing, and you have to resist the urge to join other smokers in a social context until you no longer actually crave one.

Now the smell of cigarettes (not cigars or pipes) totally disgusts me, which definitely helps not to start again. "
"Chantix. Chantix is the answer. Smoked for 10 years, and it worked for me, I've been a non smoker for the last 6 months, nothing else worked. Now I have no cravings at all. "
"You'll likely backslide. That's okay. Start over. 

Stay busy.  Exercise, hobbies, anything that's new. Break your old smoking timing and routine. 

Tell yourself that you just need to get through the first 2 days and you'll feel fine. Then, after 2 days, challenge yourself to finish out the week. Then the month.

If you absolutely, positively CANNOT resist, try an over-the-counter electronic cigarette as a compromise. Disposable and inexpensive. (You're not using it long term.) 

Use whatever works for you. Gum? Patches? Cold Turkey? Everyone is different.

Coffee can help mitigate the absence of nicotine. Coffee, not frappes/lattes/etc. Just coffee. Black. "
"Champix. Its a drug you can take which block the nicotine receptors in your brain. It's amazing. 

It also gives you the craziest dreams you will ever experience. I once dreamt I got kicked out by my Mrs, and then went to friends house to stay. The room my friend put me up in was stacked to the rafters with unpackaged chicken kievs with just enough floor space for my sleeping bag. "
Make every cigarette a reminder that you are killing yourself.  Make it a habit to think about your health when you feel like smoking
2 years smoke free after smoking for 14 years. Quit cold turkey. Willpower and determination. Oh and a pregnant wife. That’ll do it every time 
"There is no real way to stop the cravings. Just remember that every day will be a little easier than the last.  Forgive yourself for slipping up about other things (eating badly, being less responsible). You're sick, let yourself be sick."
"I took Welbutrin.  It removed all the physical symptoms of the cravings and shit, the only thing left was the mental addiction.  I barely gained any weight and had almost none of the mood swings.  If you can take it, I highly suggest it.


So, in addition, I stopped doing the things that I normally did while smoking.  Stopped going to bars and coffee shops, at least for a while (switched to gaming at friends houses where nobody smoked, or my own place).  At work, I still gave myself ""smoke breaks"" but I just got up, walked away, played a game on my phone or something, and came back to work.

Set a quit date.  Make it a hard line, no more cigarettes after that date.  Don't be one of the ""oh I'm down to xx a day"".  Making it a long process of reduced intake helps some people, but it makes ""quitting"" take just that much longer.  If you slip up, just keep going, don't set another ""quit date"", just accept you made a mistake and move on from it.

CLEAN YOUR SPACES.  Anywhere you live or work or drive, clean it.  Get that smoke smell out.  You may not notice it now but you will, even if you don't smoke there, there's a faint scent.  On your quit date, get all paraphernalia out.  No lighters, matches, cigarettes, clean all your laundry, febreeze or replace furniture, ashtrays are gone...  Everything.

Have someone to help you out.  If you're having a *really bad* day, come up with a mechanism, something to do that's different.  Something that you enjoy but don't associate with smoking.  Take up a *new* hobby (motorcycles are a good one.  Friend of mine did skydiving)."
"This will probably get buried but. 

1. Go cold turkey 
2. Visit a sauna and sweat the nicotine out. I would go once a day for 3/4 days 
3. Find something to do with your hands. 
4. Keep taking breaks but fill them up with something else. I make and drink a lot of tea now 
5. Don’t hang around smokers whilst they are smoking. If your mates smoke don’t go with them to smoking area. "
Champix is a wonderful medication
I quit drinking for 6 months. It was always the path back to smoking. 2 years smoke free now.
"cut out smokers in your life. At least for now. 

My neighbor and myself used to have a ritual of smoking together after work. Now I see her go on her lonesome self to sit out on the curb. I do not feel bad about it at all."
"Realize you will have to fight off the temptation to smoke several times a day. Then learn to recognize the feeling or situation that leads to the rise in you considering and strategizing if,how, when, to light that cigarette.  Then whenever that feeling or situation comes up train yourself to make that feeling trigger some other behavior that you choose. The things I used were to read 20 pages of a book tie up leaders for fishing or if when I was at work just finish some other specific task. Might sound dumb but it worked for me. If you can completely distract your brain for 3-5 minutes all or at least the worst of it passes. The key for me was learning to let the craving tell me to remember to do the other thing before giving too much attention to the craving itself. After a week or so the cravings diminish greatly."
"The ONLY thing a cigarette does, besides attempted murder, is create a void that asks for another... Breaking this cycle and understanding how my mind had warped this basic truth into something legitimate was an eye opening experience. It allowed me to experience my quit as a third party to my minds struggle with the eradication of the addiction."
"After 45 years smoking and countless attempts to quit and also countless remedy's,tricks,and dollars spent on lastest greatest smoking cessation gimmicks...Good ol COLD TURKEY is the only way to go and then stay stopped..I haven't smoked in 3 years...That does not mean I don't think about it and probably will for the rest of my life..however it does get easier as time goes by I promise...I truly wish ya the best..quitting smoking is the greatest gift you will give yourself...EVER!! Especially if you are still young and healthy...Dont wait till the damage is done like some of us (can't happen to me hard heads) out here."
Pick up a vape
"I switched to e-cigs, but kept my habit the same.  That is, I would go outside to smoke, even when it was cold, or at a bar, whatever, and I only used the e-cigs, no more regular cigarettes.  With the e-cig, there was no way to know when I was ""done"" smoking, so I would just hang out for a bit, puffing on it, until I got bored or wanted to go back in or whatever.  The number of times I would go out, and the length of time I was out there, gradually got less and less.  Within a month or two I was completely done with smoking, and I haven't relapsed since, which has been about 8 years or so."
"Juul.  I know it’s not really “quitting” because I’m vaping nicotine, but holy fuck if I’m not healthier after not having a cig since March.  I’ve tried a bunch of different stuff over the years (patch, vape, gum, lozenge) but none of them worked."
"Though e cigs have their own health concerns, I was able to use them to quit, because I could take a puff at any moment without needing to smoke an entire cigarettes worth of nicotine, and yet they were not pleasurable enough for me to keep doing it long term.  One day I just said meh I don't need it."
Ginger chew candies are great for knocking out the craving that creeps up in the back of your mouth.  You know the one. 
"I stopped saying that I had quit, and started thinking of myself as a smoker who takes breaks. The breaks became longer, and my self esteem didn’t have to plummet if I had a smoke or two. I don’t have to count days from zero all over again. 
In addition I was helped in a huge way by vaping.
I don’t smoke (tobacco) anymore. "
"I gave up smoking cigarettes when my first child was expected.  I ended up just smoking tobacco in other ways - the odd cigar, but mostly lots of joints. Like 3 or 4 a night. (European, we make joints with tobacco).

I tried to give up a few times and I gave up for Lent a few times, but I was an addict.

The solution for me was a paradigm shift, not a method.  I did not try and give up smoking, I became an ex smoker.

I used to have sex with pretty girls, now I am married and that is not something I do.  yes it might be fun, but it is binary NOT SOMETHING I DO.

The same is true of tobacco - it is something I do not do.  Think of it like being a vegan (I am not) or being allergic to peanuts.  It is not a struggle (although i miss it) it is just something which is not for me.

I do not really know how to verbalise the shift in mindset here, but it worked."
"I started to quit one month ago and for me it's just a one day challenge. I mean, I'm just focus on not smoking during the current day, tomorrow we will see. And step by step, it's been a month and starting to feel a bit better "
"I quit cold turkey but I didn't like it for a long time anymore before I quit. My partner wanted to quit and started vaping, slowing lowing the nicotine intake every some what months, eventuelly reached 0 nicotine and than quit with vaping as wel"
Dipping. I hate it but its a lot cheaper than nicorrette and since I absolutely loathe it I can easily give it up. I use it as a step down while substituting more and more gum. 
"1.) Moved into my own place, no roommates casually smoking around me to normalize it. If I was smoking it was purely my own intent and not a casual social thing we’re all doing. This helped.

2.) Started dating a non-smoker. Cigarette breaks were limited to times when I wasn’t around her. This significantly reduced triggers.

BONUS) just remembered, had a friend who I told he could take photos of me smoking to post on social media, because for the most part my Facebook was clean of any smoke photos as my grandparents and younger siblings would feel weird seeing that and the pressure of those photos made me uncomfortable.

3.) Got caught trying to buy cigarettes by a coworker after telling them 20 minutes prior that I was gonna quit that day. It embarrassed me enough to stay off for about 4 days.

4.) Girlfriend had a good job, I had food stamps. She set up weekly reward incentives (learned from Freakinomics, financial rewards are a bigger incentive than the actual success) of a specialty soda from my hometown, luxury coffees and beers and a final prize a PS3 (which I would lose if started smoking again).

So basically, the stars aligned for about 6 months in a row and I was able to quit with the help of circumstance. 

The real mental game I had to play was being at bars with friends who smoke, and not joining them for a cigarette. I got real used to standing around people who were smoking, but I don’t know how I did it besides telling myself it’s ok to look weird not smoking.

I also found a coffee in my area that described itself as having nodes of tobacco and I mentally told myself it was like a cigarette replacement and I would enjoy that as a “smoke break”.

Also began eating a lot of chocolate and beer to fill the void. Probably gained about 10 pounds that year from increase in appetite and replacement vices. "
Nicotine gum is working for me.
"Sugar free gum (Extra, etc).
Stop going out with smoker friends for a year or more, or at least, don't go into situations with them where you used to smoke.
Exercise more.
I tried to quit for years and only succeeded when I moved 45 minutes away for work and hardly ever saw my friends, who were all smokers."
I chewed on cinnamon sticks whenever I got a craving. They feel like a cigarette and have a little flavor. Plus they are hollow inside. I also ate frozen grapes which helped for some reason. I quit cold turkey and never went back. 
Chantix worked really well for me. 3 month program where you can smoke during the program. I completely lost all desire to smoke within 2 weeks. Some people experience side effects (night terrors among others) by I didn't have any issues. Haven't had a cig in almost 10 years.
"Chantix.    Destroyed my job, put me on edge, gave me a god complex, felt like I had the energy of a thousand suns, but hey, kicked a 20 year habit, no cravings.

&#x200B;

Chantix works if you don't actually have to be the person you were before you took it for awhile.  If you need to be that responsible, clear thinking person, who isn't on a crusade to ""never back down, never surrender"" over everything and challenge your boss to fire your 'cock blocking assistant' maybe try one of these other methods."
Cold turkey has consistently shown to be the most effective way. Honestly if you get past a week the physical craving is gone. And after six months the psychological is pretty much gone. 
"Smoke-free here for 2 years now. I had alot of help from taking Chantix but the biggest thing was accepting it as a change of habit, emotionally, socially and physically.

Excercise, sleep and lots of fluids to help with the physical withdrawal symptoms.

Mindfulness, or grounding technqiues to help with the mental/emotional stress or withdrawal. Journaling also helps with tracking the positive effects that will gradually show up. Just remember to take it one day at a time with your emotions.

Lastly, this is crucial unfortantely; avoid social situations where you know you can borrow a cigarette from someone or where you know will be surrounded by smokers. 

Even if you relapse, try again and again. It took me 4 tries before I finally made it past 4 months of being smoke free; I'm a lot less stressed, more productive, have a little more cash and smell good lol."
"Consider yourself a non-smoker now amd don't beat yourself up when you relapse. Know that its going to be a fight, but one that you are going to win."
"Use your newfound budget to repaint your whole house if you smoke inside.

Trust me, as the child of someone who chained 1.5 packs per day, the walls were *yellow* when I moved out, they weren't when I moved in."
"go to your doctor and get champix, i went from 30+ a day to 0 in 3 days without cravings"
Mental conditioning. You have to believe 100% that cigarettes are SHIT.
Vaping definitely helps. Eventually you get tired of vaping and then you are free again. 
"Crippling existential dread about the meaninglessness of life and the cruel finality of death.

Also a really low nicotine e-cig for a few months was super helpful. "
"I listened to the audiobook of Allen Carr’s Stop Smoking, and it made all the difference. I needed to understand how the addiction was working in order to fight the urge and stay away. I quit before the audiobook was finished and never picked one up again. I celebrated five years this past May."
"I’ve tried weening myself off of them and setting dates and all that, but ended up failing. The only thing that worked for me was quitting cold turkey. Was just randomly having a smoke break at work one day and quit mid cigarette. Just looked at the cigarette, said  out loud “I don’t want to smoke anymore. I quit” and grabbed the packs I had in my toolbox and gave them to a guy I worked with. Got the strangest look from the guy too lol. I’ve smoked once since then and it has been about 6 years. Probably not amazing advice and may not work for everybody, but it worked for me. "
"If you’re not fully committed to quitting, don’t bother. You will just use any excuse you can come up with to rationalize having “just this one”. "
"Don't go into gas stations. Period.

Gas stations are pretty much the only place I ever bought cigarettes. Going in to pay for gas was basically just an excuse to also grab a pack or two. Honestly, there's no *real* reason for me to go inside of a gas station. I don't drink soda, eat candy, or have any interest in anything else in there. It's hard to go in and pay and just stare at that wall of cigarettes .

When I stopped doing that I was far less tempted to buy just one more pack."
"Just do it. Don’t plan. Don’t set a date. And do it cold turkey, otherwise you’re just replacing one source of nicotine with another and ultimately prolonging the process. Weed helps too. "
"Instead of smoking, don't smoke.  NEXT."
"Have some self discipline. If you slip up and buy a pack, when you light the first one up and start feeling guilty, through the rest of the pack in the trash immediately. Don’t turn one mistake into twenty. "
"This isn't the answer a lot of people are looking for but it worked for me after being a pack and a half a day smoker for years. Be aware that you need to both break a physical addiction as well as the mental addiction to the habits that you have developed.

The best way to quit smoking is to quit smoking. 

Vapes, patches, gums, extend your addiction and after a few weeks/months of your cravings not going away you'll get discouraged and go right back to the pack because you only tried to address the physical side. I use the word BREAK intentionally because that's what you have to do. You need to BREAK the habit, not ease yourself out of it.

Educate yourself on the symptoms of withdrawal and the timeline of how they go away and managing them becomes much easier. 

Tomorrow morning don't have a cigarette. Next time you have an urge... don't have a cigarette. It gives you a headache? Take an advil. Your mood starts fly all over the place? Take a walk. Understand that after a week when you wake up without a smokers cough you'll still have a lot of other symptoms but be happy you made it that far... and don't have a cigarete.
"
"I was never a heavy smoker, like 10 cigarettes a day at the very most.  To quit, I used the patch.  Several failed attempts with the gum, chantix (omg my stomach!), and other things like toothpicks, etc..  I started with the level 2 patch for three months, then moved to the level 1 patch for three more months, and then because I couldn't go without - I started cutting the level 1 patch into quarters.  After a few weeks of this, I was an ex-smoker - this happened in 2007."
"It’s been about 8 1/2 years now cold turkey.  It was -40 and I wanted to be warm, I only smoked outside.

Never picked it back up because the worst of it was during Christmas and I was busy.  It slipped my mind and I just never picked it back up.  The smell is enough to keep me away now.

Good luck to you!"
"Try to rewire your thoughts so that not having a cigarette becomes the reward. We all know that cigarettes are enjoyable because they exploit the reward mechanisms in your brain. When you crave one and make a decision to not act on that craving, give yourself a mental pat on the back for making that responsible decision. When you have your next craving 45 seconds later, do it again. Try to keep it so that not having a cigarette is a good thing instead of just another thing stressing you out."
"Associate the act with something you aren't planning on doing anymore. So stop smoking during breakfast or lunch or whatever and associate only smoking at a specific place, like your job. I did this and then when I quit the job I quit the smokes too. Cold turkey never looked back."
"Never smoke, ever. 

I “quit” numerous times before finally getting it right. There are many things you can do to help ease the suckiness, distractions, etc, but the thing you need most IMO is resolve. 

 A friend at the time had gone through AA recently and I asked him how he gave up alcohol and he said that he just told himself he was never going to drink, no excuses. Bad day, death in the family, good day, I’ve been good for XX weeks so I can probably have just one...the list is endless. 

Basically my problem was that I kept convincing myself I had my addiction under control. I never did and never could, so once I realized that the only way to quit was to never, EVER, EVER FUCKING EVER smoke even one teeny cigarette, I was able to do it. It took me 22 years but it’s been 16 years now. "
"This is what worked for me:

Download QuitNow! App. 
Buy Vape. 
Break up with crazy stressful ex   

Smoke free 2 years!"
Eat baby carrots.  Unlike some snacks there’s no salt and you will get sick before they make you fat.  But great to give your hand s and mouth something to do. 
Listen to music you can sing too!
"I laid out a plan for quitting. Before quitting I went on the American Cancer Society website and American Heart/Lung Association to really learn about smoking related cancers. I read all their advice for quitting and what studies showed in terms of long-term quitting success. I learned that nicotine levels return to normal after about 1 week of quitting, after that, it was all mental. This empowered me. I learned that smoking can double the risk of infertility issues for women and my biggest dream in life was to be a mom, so this became my mantra and motivation.
I picked a Quit Date (March 20, 1999), switched to cigarettes I hated for the last month, began to wean down the number of cigarettes to the bare minimum (my two hardest cigarette times to quit were before bed and driving to work), I bought low-cal candy to distract my mouth at craving times, bought healthy snacks to eat instead and bought a gym membership to combat any weight gain. It is hard to smoke and run at the same time.
On my Quit Day I asked for family and friend support, took it easy and rewarded myself with a manicure. Every day the first week I gave myself a small reward, this wired my brain for positive association with not smoking. After the first week of success, I rewarded myself every Friday if I hadn’t smoked all week. I would get a new book, go for a hike, get a massage, a dinner out, coffee with a friend, etc. All healthy and happy rewards. 
It worked. I’ve never looked back."
"You have to commit yourself. You have to want it. You cannot do it for your spouse, your kids, your parents, your pets...., you have to do it for YOU. You have to want it. "
Will power. 
Quitting is a decision you make for yourself. It will never be easy. I haven’t had a cig in over a year but I still crave them all the time. Smell a cig? Want one. Drink some whiskey? Want one. Bang my wife? Want one. But I don’t smoke them anymore because I decided not to. 
"Just do it. It's not that hard. At least not as hard as everyone says it is. If you want to do it, you'll do it.  


Reduce to quit. First day half the amount you smoke then a couple days later half that. Before you know it you'll have it."
Dip all of your cigarettes in pcp 
"I used nicotine gum, would buy really shitty cigars to smoke about 1/4 of after dinner for the first week.  It has to be undesirable or it will just be a replacement.

I've been quit a little over a year at this point, it sucks.  I want one every.....single.....day, and about once a month that's all I want for an entire day.  But the longer it goes the easier it is.

The smell has started to become sort of repulsive as well, except for every now and then someone will fire up that good one out of a pack.

Moral of the story is, it's not fun, and you're still gonna want to smoke after,  but for me I'm far to stubborn to go  back.  After as much as it sucked quitting"
"# You have to want to quit.

That thing they say, ""You have to want to quit."" is not just BS. It's the biggest part of it. My wife has been the only person who has asked me to quit. 

She wanted me to quit before we got married. I stopped for about a week.

She asked again for me to quit before our son was born, I stopped for a week, bought an e-cig and two weeks later was smoking again.

I never smoked a lot, but then I got laid off in 2014 from my IT job, then started working as a utility locator (did that for about a year or so, now back in IT). Before, I could only go smoke on break and during lunch when I could get outside to do so. At the locator job, I could smoke in my truck, smoke anytime I wanted. That new found freedom, plus the stress of literally losing 50% of my previous pay, bills, etc......I literally went from half a pack a day to a pack a day in two months. Wife started to notice and wasn't happy. She'd say something about it, I'd get annoyed and go smoke another one or three. She finally quit asking me to quit.

I say all of that b/c I didn't want to quit, and that's why it never worked. One day, I just decided that I couldn't smoke for the rest of my life. I always had a lot of reasons why I should quit (kids, wife didn't like it but tolerated it, health, Dr. said it was a good idea, commercials said it was a good idea, even more sexy time with wife if I didn't smell and taste like an ashtray, etc.) but none of it really mattered until sometime in June of 2016. I don't know what changed my mind, but all of a sudden those reasons made sense and I wanted to quit. It wasn't like I suddenly loved my wife and kids more, or I cared more about my health and the health of those around me. I don't know exactly how to explain it, just one day I was like, *I want to stop smoking so that I can do ""things"" for ""people"" I care about.*

I used the patches. Bought them over the counter at Wal-Mart. I slipped a couple of times during the first two weeks, but smoked my very last cigarette on June 15, 2016. It gets easier as time goes on. I also developed a new found love for sunflower seeds. You will gain weight. As a utility locator, I walked 6-8 miles a day. I weighted 170lbs when I stopped smoking, and within a year I weighed 190lbs. Now that I sit on my ass all day again, I weigh 210....I need to exercise more.

&#x200B;

I still work with people who smoke, but the funny thing is, now I don't like the smell of it. Before, I'd see someone smoking IRL, or on TV or in a game and I'd have to go have one. Now, I'm not really disgusted by it, but I don't have that urge anymore. I see someone smoking now and think, *damn, I wasted a lot of money.*

According to the app I have on my phone, I quit June 15, 2016 @ 00:00. Based on a pack a day @ $5.50/pack - I've not smoked 16,990 cigarettes and saved $4,672.28.

I actually didn't start smoking until I was about 30. Just had a bunch of friends and family who still smoked...my sister, my aunt, an uncle, both grandfathers, one grandmother, two bro-in-laws.....just got tired of being out of the cool crowd. This was ***AFTER*** my grandmother died of lung cancer when I was a kid and my grandfather (her husband) had a tracheotomy due to throat cancer that he developed. They both smoked unfiltered Camels for 50 years. I know, stupid decision. 

My sister quit a year before I did b/c she got pregnant, and my Dad quit when I was 4 or 5 b/c I told him that when I grew up, I wanted to smoke just like he did. I used to go outside with him and play on the porch while he smoked. He said that when I told him that, he had literally just opened that pack, smoked that one cigarette and then walked in and threw the rest away. He said that was the one thing that made him want to quit. He quit cold turkey and never touched another one.

TL;DR - You aren't going to quit until you want to. Please find a reason to want to, OP. :)"
"Talk to your bank account, I live in Canada so ciggs are insanely expensive. I did the math, i spent 11k on ciggs in one year. I went pale and quit."
"Not from personal experience, and this may be extreme to some, but after doing LSD, my boyfriend quit smoking cold turkey. Apparently it works in that way for some. "
This sounds dumb but try to visualize yourself as a non-smoker. I quit 30 years ago back when restaurants has smoking and non-smoking sections. Instead of saying it didn't matter I would insist on the non-smoking section even before I had fully quit. If necessary become judgmental and feel superior to smokers even before you quit.
Get rid of your lighters. 
Don't count the days since your last on until you are sure you are past a month it puts less stress on you
"I quit smoking on August 4, 2017. The way I did it was a combination of vaping (buying an actual vape, not a juul or anything like that), and then catching pneumonia (unrelated). Vaping was going good...I started at 12mg, then went down to 6 mg, then to 3... then I caught pneumonia in January, and gave it up entirely. "
Chantix is what worked for me. Follow the directions. I used it about a month or more before I quit. Then I used it for another 6 months or more. When I quit I still had cravings  but they were manageable. I have been nicotine free for about a year and a half.  Without it I would have made it about 15 minutes. 
"Water, carry a water bottle everywhere.  It satisfies the oral fixation which is the secondary addiction aside from nicotene.  Also as a smoker your addiction centre converts your body's normal signals for thirst and hunger into compelling you to satisfy the urges to have a cigarette instead.   Water also helps satisfy most of these urges when you quit so that you don't convert all the urges to satisfy with eating snacks which makes most gain weight as a result.  Most people don't drink enough water but especially smokers as it saps the hydration from your body as well.  Water."
"I quit cold turkey 5 years ago, it sucked but what helped me was quitting after thanksgiving. I hate the cold weather so as it got colder that first winter, it actually helped me fight the urge to go outside and smoke one. By the summer I had been so used to not having one I didn’t slip up and have been smoke free since "
"Smoker for 35 years and all of a sudden I kept thinking they tasted like poison.
I didn't want them to taste that way---
I fucking loved smoking.
I mean, I hoped to quit somehow one day, but..
No matter how hard I tried to smoke,( and I REALLY wanted my fucking cigarettes!!) they kept tasting and feeling like they were poisoning me.
I'm not crazy, btw, just saying.
Maybe you could manifest that thought somehow."
"Whenever I craved one, I would just take some really really deep breaths to remind myself how important it was for me to stop. It became easier as my lung capacity started to build. Also, it helps if you get out of your routine. Smoking as a habit was (for me at least) 95% routine, 5% enjoyment. "
"If you smoke weed and you’re trying to quit cigarettes, smoke blunts.

I smoked a half pack a day and I was able to quit by smoking a couple of blunts throughout the day. Just roll a couple of swisher sweets up at the beginning of your day, smoke on one until you get your fix, put it out and relight it when you need it again. 

I did this for about 2 to 3 months before I switched over to rolling joints, now I won’t touch a cigarette(it’s been 10 years since I last smoked)."
"Smoked for about 7 years.....started using those Blu e-Cigs (before all this vape craze these days) for a while which were pretty nice.  Started hearing info that these were possibly attributed to the same system that those fog machines were using and I immediately stopped using them.  At that time I had already not been smoking regular cigarettes for about 2 months or so, so I basically just quit cold turkey from there on out and haven't smoked since....that was about 2010."
"I quit more or less cold turkey. My change was a night of bar hopping. I had a cigarette before we got in an Uber and apparently that just made my drunkeness so much worse. Fiance made sure several times in the car that I was still alive/breathing. Spent the next few hours hugging the toilet. Worst hangover ever. Somehow, that led to me quitting. (I also don't really barhop anymore. Keeps me from having too much.)"
"Smoked for 11 years.  I honestly couldn't quit until it was for just me.  I started to realize how bad they tasted.  I would make a mental note of it. Then I started to notice the faint smell it left all over everything.  Eventually time between cigars would get longer and longer, until one day I went to hold one up to my face and I was so repulsed by it I just couldn't anymore.  I'm at 7 months clean so far."
"Leverage a change of surroundings to kick the habit. If you are moving to a new city or a new home, use this event to quit. I noticed that most of my urges were habit related - light up while waking to the bus stop, light up on the balcony before going to sleep, light up when you start arranging the books. When I moved to a new city, I quit. Since the environment was new, I was not doing most of the things that I was doing out of habit earlier. There was no walk to the bus stop, no balcony, no bookshelf. Without the triggers, it was easier to resist. Plus, there were so many othee things to do which took my mind off the urge to smoke. 
Hope this helps someone!
PS: Was a smoker for 9 years, quit 7 years ago."
"You just have to quit. Put out that cigarette and don't light up another. Think of yourself as a nonsmoker, not an ex-smoker, not an occasional smoker -- a nonsmoker. Cravings suck, but they go away. And every time you overcome a craving, the weaker the associations between the craving and the crave-inducing activity (drinking, billiards, band practice, whatever) become. After a couple years, ten years, maybe forever, you will still have cravings, but they will be so infrequent it's actually kind of interesting from a psychological perspective when they present themselves. While unmistakably a cigarette craving, it will feel so unusual at that point that you can easily isolate and ignore it. "
"For me it took a few tries. First a week or 2. Then a month or 2 then I just stopped. I got into the routine having a cigarette at work breaks. While driving etc so I just learned to find a new habit in those times. Overall it was the decision of realizing how sick I felt, the bad taste and smell that I carried. "
Get pissed off about it
Don't start
"Not sure I'd reccomend it, but I picked out a day, and the night before, I picked up 2 packs of Marlboro Reds and one pack of filterless Camels.  I went out drinking and chainsmoked all 3 packs.  I woke up so sick, I couldn't even look at a cigarette, and that went on for 3 days or so.  By the time I felt better, I had already gone 3 full days without smoking, so I just kept going.  10 years later, I still don't smoke anymore."
"i’ve tried every method and the one that finally did it was simply eliminating 2 cigarettes a day from how many I smoked over the course of several weeks till i was at zero. i started at a a pack a day and every week smoked 2 less cigarettes a day. when i hit the week of zero a day I did not use patches or gum. I found both of those methods just made my addiction linger. 

the other thing that really helped was a genuine desire to quit but keeping in mind I was going to fail at quitting. it takes the average person 5 attempts to successfully quit smoking, it took me 7 and that’s ok. the important thing to remember if you relapse is it’s not the end of the world and you will be able to try again whenever you are ready. don’t beat yourself up, take your time. you’ll do the thing when you are prepared. "
"I never really quit.  I ran out of smokes in October 2009, and just haven't been to the store to buy more.  I tried everything before that.  The patch, gum, pills.  The only thing that worked for me was to just....stop.  "
"I have a couple that worked for me, I hope they work for you too:

Figure out if it's an oral fixation, an addiction, or just a fidget. Once that's figured out it can get a little easier, my cigarette smoking was a fidget, so I just gave myself something else to fidget with, I'm kinda adhd.

If you can tolerate it, chew sugar free gum, it can help with fidgeting and get some of that urge out.

If munch something, try to keep it low calorie, this is how people gain weight when they quit.

Change up your routine, if you don't have those ""scheduled"" cigarette breaks then it helps with ""not finding time to smoke"".

Try with your might to avoid triggers, for me, the hardest one was lighting up in the car on the way somewhere. That's hard to do, instead I kept a pen in my center console so I could fiddle with that in traffic.

Exercise, it's pretty exhilarating when you get done at the gym or coming in from a run and your chest isn't aching.

Make a little note to remind yourself why. This was a lpt I had come across one day in reddit. I made a note on my reasons and made it the background for my phone. Every time I saw the homescreen it was a reminder why.

Just remember, relapses happen, don't beat yourself up. Some places have tobacco cessation assistance, if you find yourself needing it, don't be afraid to reach out. 

I wish you all the success in your journey to quit! "
"If you’re a big smoker when you drink, you’re going to have to quit drinking for while too.   When I quit smoking, I was semi OK at first, but first beer I had I relapsed, knew I couldn’t drink but not smoke."
"The newer pod vapes like the Juul and the Juno are probably the best for people getting off of smoke, I'd say. "
Just stop smoking. That's it. Just stop.  It's the only way.
Read the book. It’s called “The Easy Way to Stop Smoking” by Allen Carr. I quit a year and a half ago after reading it. You keep smoking while you read it but by the end of it you’re done. Forever. Best decision I ever made. 
"For anybody reading this,  parents and others with friends and family. Just stop, really. My girlfriend lost her Dad to cancer very likely due to smoking. Just stop, it's hard losing a loved one like that , it's no fun when they pump you full of pain medicines and  if your lucky die quick or very slowly and then the loved ones around you live in pain all because you wasted time and money on a stupid cancerous stick and now they have to fight with depression and nightmares and haunting images. Just because you feel like you need it."
"Find something that you KNOW causes you to smoke out of stress or anxiety, and use that as fuel to quit in spite of it. Be determined that you are NOT going to allow this ""whatever"" to influence your life anymore in a negative way... For me, it was my ex wife. We had been separated for a while, and going through a bitter divorce. I was already a pack-a-day smoker, and she knew she was getting under my skin every damn day. I went to about 2, almost 3 packs a day for about 6 months. On November 16th, 2013 she had hung up on me during a phone call about my visitation rights with our children. I was pissed off. Big time. I reached for my pack of cigarettes, walked out on the balcony of my hotel, and put one up to my lips. Just before lighting up I had a moment of clarity, and I said to myself: ""This is what you want, isn't it? You WANT me stressed out. You WANT my blood pressure to be sky high with the only coping mechanism I can find being an expensive carton of cigarettes... Well fuck you, bitch, I won't give you the god damn satisfaction!""

I haven't smoked a cigarette since, and I'm healthier and happier because of it. In spite of her.     "
Start by bringing cash If you go into a convenient store. So if you go and are only going to grab a drink bring only that amount of cash needed to get the drink. Don’t bring in more just in case of the temptation. 
"After the first 24 hours it gets easier. Find something to do with your hands, I bought a rubiks cube, my friend took up knitting."
Juul. It’s not much better but I’m at five months now.
"You know that feeling you get when you have a cigarette after not having one for a while?  That ""Aaaaaahhhh"" euphoric feeling?  That only happens because of the nicotine addiction being satisfied.  ""Just one"" will not give you that feeling.  You will not get that feeling unless you have a couple, become addicted again, and then satisfy that addiction.  Learning this helped me not fall into that trap, and still helps me today when I think about having just one."
Cold turkey. For the first 3 days find ways to keep yourself busy. Wethers its cleaning the house or whatever. Its those first 3 days that will cause relapses. Also avoid drinking for a little while.
"Go cold turkey. Have people in your life around you that hate smoking. Don't go to social scenarios that you typically end up smoking at (drinking with friends that smoke) for a month or 2. Do not have cigarettes laying around your home, vehicle, job etc.  Do not put a cigarette in your hand or mouth again without knowing it will ruin your streak and will totally start you up again. After about a month or 2 the smell will have you guessing how you ever breathed that shit in the first place.

Esit: Also most people don't know tabacco is radioactive from the radioactive lead and potassium the plant draws in while growing. The amont of radiation an average smoker absorbs in your lungs is 8 times the OSHA limit for radiation contamination clean up crew. Or twice that of an astronaut (the highest exposure of any job). Here's a video comparing the most radioactive places on Earth so you get an idea of what you're doing to yourself.

"Don't set yourself up for failure. Don't go into the gas station, theres almost no reason to ever do that, you don't need the gas station snacks and you will just tempt yourself with a purchase. Don't go near the aisle you can buy cigarettes in, no reason to be in that lane or near it and it will just tempt you. Don't go outside when your friends want to smoke, it will just tempt you and you're setting yourself up. IF you have someone in your life that has the time to hold you accountable that is setting yourself up for success. It takes willpower, theres no magic way to avoid that..but you can still make it easier on yourself by not being around it. Also replacing it with a healthier habit can do wonders, you'll start to look forward to the new habit instead of looking forward to your next smoke. I do little puzzles on my phone instead "
"After trying everything over the years, the only thing that finally worked for me was Chantix.  Smoke free for almost eight years now--rarely if ever even think about smoking and I was almost two packs a day when I stopped."
"Exercise and chewing gum worked for me... its hard, especially at first. You will need all the willpower you can possibly muster, especially if you've been smoking a lot and for a long time.

The first 72 hours will be the hardest. All cravings will eventually pass.

I also found that downloading an app like I am Sober to track how long its been is helpful. I'm just over 8 months smoke free now and have saved $1600 

But the most important thing is actually wanting to quit. Like for real. You gotta want it"
Substituted ciggies for exercise. I suggest finding a good substitute that you can rely on when you are feeling the craving.
"This is probably going to be burried, but i hope you read it OP. I smoked a pack a day for 8 years, tried a bunch of stuff, nicorete quickmist did it for me. It's still hard, but that shit works "
"First off, you HAVE to want to. By the time I quit, I was so desperate to kick the habit that I didn't struggle much. I bought a box of nicorette gum and a box of Equate patches. I got the highest milligram of both, and I used a patch a day for a week, then instead of buying the lower mg, I just cut them in half, and then quarters. With the patches, they take a while to work, so it's best to put them on at night. That was where I struggled, because I liked showering in the morning and had to switch to night. I chewed the gum with the patches, which you're not supposed to, but it helped with sudden urges. Then, after I quit the patches I chewed the gum for another week or so. Have no desire to smoke again, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't cross my mind often. The key is wanting to quit, even download a quit tracker app to see how much money you're saving and how much life you're getting back - that helps for a lot of people."
Know the head game. I quit cold turkey after reading The Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr.  I didn't find it incredibly difficult once I understood and could recognize the withdrawal.  
I ended up having to take chantix to actually quit. Also. Not being around other smokers much helped too! And actually wanting to quit!
Everytime i feel like a cigarette i just remind myself its the addiction that is asking for it and i will get nothing but bad breath and cancer out of it.
Hard cardio did it for me! I took up boxing. You won’t want to sacrifice your lungs or any of the progress you’ve made for a cigarette. 
Start running or take up a sport that is quite demanding. The pain you will feel from how fucked up your lungs have got and the shame of getting gassed out fast will help remind you why you want to quit and as you get fitter it will make you not want to ruin the progress made by turning back. 
Drink a glass of water every time i wanted to smoke. It really helped. 
Don't hang out with smokers. 
"I went the medical route with welbutrin. It was amazing. Less then 4 weeks later, I was off smokes and I've never gone back. Four years clean now. "
"Eat, it will lessen the cravings.  You will gain a little weight, but it's worth it.  Then the cravings will be gone in a couple of days."
"I got that quit smoking app and it really motivated me to stay smoke free.  It counts all the cigs you would have had since your last one and tracks the recovery of your heart, lungs etc. Seeing that I have not smoked 560 cigarettes in the last month really put it into perspective for me.  Think about smoking 560 cigarettes! Disgusting, right?

Edit: spelling"
"I had to quit my associations at the same time too.

"My mom quit cold turkey after finding out a friend of mine was allergic or super sensitive to cigarette smoke and my mom had driven a few of us to the mall for my birthday. My friend coughed the whole time but I (and my mom) didn’t find oh until months later why. I was humiliated and so was my mom. New Year’s Day she just quit, never looked back. Unlike my dad, who tried the gum, medicine (Chantix?), dum dums, etc. He finally quit for good (I hope) after having a heart attack a few years ago. "

"There is no magic secret. There is no one amazing trick. You suck it up and accept that your life is going to be worse for a week. Your going to feel weird. You might even feel a little sick from time to time. After that week you will feel better. After a month you will feel euphoric about your achievement and just how much better you feel. After 6 months you wont think about smoking much any more. You'll still be reminded from time to time but it wont be an everyday or even every week thought.

"Hypnosis. 

I smoked a pack and a half a day for 12 years. I had tried cold turkey, the patch and gum - they were all difficult and never managed to last. Hypnosis was easy and I haven’t bought a pack in 11 years."
"My doctor basicly scared the shit out of me at a visit, explained in detail what would happen. For some reason it really had an impact. Walked out and threw my pack away and havent touched it since."
"I smoked a pack a day for about 8 years and loved it.  I had always heard that even smoking like that for 10 years vastly increases your chances for lung cancer, and i told myself I would never get to 10 years.  I never tried to quit during those 8 years and I knew I had to do something or this would be for my entire life.

What worked for me is actually deciding fully to quit, and letting people know of my intentions (pretty much so that they were there to give me shit if I fucked up).  I never claimed I was “going to” quit, I just kept all that to myself until I actually made the decision that I don’t want to smoke anymore.  I made it a point not to tell anyone until I was sure.  Then, I told people I was quitting, and got rid of the rest of the pack I still had.  That was 5 years ago and haven’t smoked one since.  I had a little temptation for about two days ( every time I ate/woke up/smoked weed/etc). After those two days, they started smelling bad to me when other people would smoke around me.  Then I didn’t really want them anymore.  "
"Find something you like more than smoking.

"Ahh the bitch of quitting smoking. I've done all form of nicotine--chew, gums, patches, cigars all of it but finally put my last cigarette out April 21, 1986. 

Now I vape and cutting that down too. I'm old and have wrestled with nicotine a long time and even tried hypnosis. Problem with hypnosis was the 'hypno-therapist' had a heavy smokers cough and continued hacking all through my suggestions! Hilarious but true and it didn't work either. In 86, I came late to a ""stop-smoking meeting"" and they locked the doors to late-comers and I was so pissed off and bummed, I drew a circle around the date on the calendar, wrote in the year and quit. Cold turkey and stayed off for 2 years and then started with chewing tobacco. Bad plan that one, as dentist pleaded with me to quit because oral cancer is FAST, deadly and results, as he said, ""horrifying."" Quit that 5 years ago and vaping ever since. But reading about vaping here has now upset my 'plan' because I've noticed it does affect my wind/breath when diving and running. Scuba diving in Hawaii recently, and I burned through my air faster than all other divers and I wondered how that is possible because I vape. Because it does plug up the lungs, that's how. Now after reading all these posts, I know I got to get off of vaping too. Thanks for posting the query, and good luck to all. 

Carr's book didn't help me but his line is memorable: ""with cigarettes, 1 is too many and a million not enough."" "
"Just don’t smoke that one cigarette.  Not don’t smoke forever,  that’s too big,  just don’t smoke that one.  That one your mind is trying  to trick you into right now.  Maybe later.  Maybe tomorrow.  Maybe New Years But not this one.  Not right now.

Embrace what I call your addiction voice.  That voice in your head that tries to convince you to smoke.  It’s a smarter more creative version of you.  “If you quit 10 years,  your risk factors go back to normal.  So we’re only 32... we could quit at 40 and still be ok”...  “. Day 3.  Look how easy this was.  We could just smoke now and do this again next year.  We’ve proven we can do it”.... “ok great job.  Two weeks clean.  We can celebrate with a smoke.  Since were non smokers now,  we can be one of those occasional smokers”... “no problem if you just bum one... as long as you don’t buy a pack... you’re 2 months in now-  certainly established as a non-smoker”

Don’t fight that stuff or you’ll constantly be in the traditional “will power” cycle and you’ll lose to your addiction voice.  Embrace it.  Yea... good point.  Sure enough.  Yep.  All of that is fine and all those mental conversations are fine as long as.... the answer is never let’s smoke one cigarette.  Not when drinking,  not on a special occasion,  not for a rationalized experiment.  You can do anything else.  Treat us like your conservative Facebook uncle.  You can agree with your addiction voices conclusion that the whole thing is a made up Chinese plot and smoking isn’t even bad for you.  You can agree that smoking is just the right thing for you and plenty of smokers live to 100.  As long as you don’t smoke a cigarette.

You’re an addict.  For real.  It’s not a lessor or more casual ailment.  I was amazed the first time I ever quit for a few months that when I smoked one cigarette I woke up the next morning almost completely just as addicted and craving  as I had been when I was a full time smoker.  It faded but was easier only because my habits had changed.  My addiction hadn’t.

I believe in various types of nicotine replacement but don’t really believe in an organized substitute like gum or candy or sunflower seeds.  You’re just promoting the same behavior.  Talk to your addiction voice, embrace it and reject the immediate need to solve that issue.  It can always wait until tomorrow.

And Chantix.  Chantix is amazing. (I had to quit twice-  once for 6 years,  then a 1 year relapse and quit again 6 months ago.  Second time with Chantix.)"
"I quit back in 1999 and never looked back.


The things that worked for me:

* Convincing myself that I hated the smell

* Avoided being around smokers - This one was pretty hard as it involved not visiting or hanging out with any friends for about half a year. The only smoker I couldn't avoid was my wife, who quit with me but didn't make it.

* Got a different car that didn't stink

* Convinced my wife to not smoke inside the house

It'll be 20 years in January. My wife quit a few times, most notably during pregnancy. She switched to e-cigarettes about 6 years ago. I'm not sure if it is any healthier but it sure helps with the smell. I have wondered that if e-cigarettes were available in 1999, would I have successfully quit?

To this day, I still catch myself reaching inside my jacket when leaving a building in wintertime."
"Stop buying them.

Seriously. I used to smoke nearly a pack a day. One day I decided that ~$12 a pack (yay canada) was too expensive and that I'd only be a mooch and bum smokes from friends. Eventually they got sick if me asking and I was enjoying the extra money saved so i just kinda...stopped. havent had one in 4 years."
"my dad turned to sugar free popsicles, it's been more than fifteen years since his last cigarette but now he eats like 8 popsicles every night"
Have a nicotine reduction plan. Don't let one relapse jeopardize nyour quitting. Tell people around you are quitting and to not give you cigarettes. Have someone to talk to when it will get hard.
Find another habit that's less of a nuisance and easier to break. 
"If you're trying to quit, watch this short video. At least once a week.

https://youtu.be/0TL2Vh7goJc"
"Don't beat yourself up for failing, just try again"
"My solution is entirely impractical, because it involves changing everything about your life until smoking doesn't fit into it anymore.

-Lost a job where I chainsmoked before, on breaks, and after. At later jobs I consciously made an effort to not include smoking into the new routine.

-Stopped going out and partying so much. Less late drinking led to less smoking.

-Moved in with my girlfriend (later my wife) who hated smoking, so I had to smoke less.

-Had a kid, which made quitting even more important.

-Rising cost. A pack of cigarettes costs like $10 where I live now.

All that and it still took me three years to fully quit."
"When you want to quit its easy.  Its hard when you don't want to quit, but feel like you should.  I'm not sure if that makes sense to everyone.  For me I tried quitting several times, all though I knew  really deep down I didn't want to.  When I really wanted to do it, I had my last smoke.  Gave my daughter my pack of cigarettes to throw away.  That was it, I was done.  Good luck.  Cheers"
"I used the patch successfully, along with some addiction cutting hints a close friend learned by getting off of pain killers.

You want to limit what you're trying to cut out of your life at once, people often mess up these things by trying to quit smoking, drinking, eating poorly, start exercising, etc all at once, and that's setting yourself up for failure.

So, the patch let me not worry about the physical side at first, and allowed me to focus on the habit.  I never bought a pack after I started the patch, but I did smoke maybe 3 cigarettes the first week (down from a pack to a pack and a half a day).  Never smoked again after that first week.  I kept my hands busy doing chores and whatever I could, and I drank a lot of water to help with the oral fixation.

For the patch, I went with the highest dosage I could, and just followed directions.  After about two weeks, I started to get extremely jittery and stepped down the dosage.  Keep the lower dosage for another two weeks, and after getting a similar jittery feeling, used the lowest dosage for a couple days.  By then, I was really over it and that was that."
Be to lazy to buy more packs when you run out
I quit a 30 year habit by vaping.  It really does work.  I had asthma so bad that I couldn't sleep through the night.  I told myself I would vape to cut down on smoking.  I tried the gas station ones and they are crap.  Have a vaping friend or a vape shop set you up.  The day I bought my vape was the last day I smoked.  It's been three years now.  I no longer need any asthma medication or an inhaler.  I smell like strawberry wherever I go.  You can even sneak one in the bathroom at a doctors appointment that's taking too long. 
Quit smoking 4 years ago and got a gym membership at the same time. Working out helps you sweat the nicotine out and for me personally it was a motivator to be healthy. It also helps prevent to potential weight gain that comes with quitting smoking. I smoked for 8 years. 
Wean off slowly until you are only smoking 1 maybe 2 a day after that quit buying them and try your hardest to not go back eventually cigarettes will taste gross to you but at the end of the day you really have to want to quit and it will suck a lot at times but remind yourself why you are doing it and the benefits of it.
"I found Wellbutrin was a life saver.  I smoked from the time I was a freshman in college (17) until my gynecologist told me (at 32) that I'd have to quit by the time I was 35 or she'd refuse to prescribe birth control.  So my regular doctor prescribed Wellbutrin for depression, because insurance wouldn't pay for it if it was only for smoking.  You take it for ten days, then quit smoking.  So on January 11, 1998, I stopped smoking. Never faltered at all. In fact, almost immediately, the smell of cigarette smoke was disgusting to me, like it had been before I started smoking. I can barely breathe when anyone smokes around me. 

And the bonus is that I realized I was actually chronically low-level depressed and I stayed on the Wellbutrin ever since. It was like it took a film of dinginess off my brain."
"1) wake up one morning not wanting to smoke
2) stop smoking
(though I do carry a pack with me to share with my friends or when I go out and want to socialize a bit more)"
"I was a pack a day smoker for about 9 years. I tried vaping, I tried gum, nicotine patches, etc.

Three years ago I thought I had gotten bronchitis for the third time & I decided to quit cold turkey. Haven't smoked since.

What helped most was an app called SmokeFree. You can enter in how much a pack of cigarettes costs, how many you smoke a day, and it calculates how much money you can save in a year and how much you've saved so far. It has a lot of other nifty features but opening the app and seeing I've saved about $4k so far is a good motivator to not pick it back up."
"Exercising and brushing my teeth/using mints worked pretty well for me. 

But, in complete, utter honesty, the last nail in the smoking coffin was getting so disgusted with myself that I really couldn't bear to smoke anymore. The brushing teeth often (between meals, after morning coffee/breakfast, before bed) really helped me feel disgusted with smoking, but it wasn't until I suddenly smoked a pack a day one time while I was drinking, and felt awful for days afterward that I finally quit cold turkey. "
"Accept that it's going to hurt for a week or two, and then you'll crave it for a long time, and then you put down your last butt and never buy another pack."
"Chantix. Chantix. I tried to quit for 1-2 years off and on — then I got prescribed Chantix and it was the best decision I ever made. I also chewed sunflower seeds for the oral fixation help through the first couple of weeks. 
A lot of people mention the nightmares or bad dreams from chantix. I experienced very “vivid” dreams, however never nightmares. 
I always see the Chantix commercials and actually believe the people because I know that it works. 
Good luck!"
I started vaping four years ago. I currently have not had a cig for that amount of time. I HOWEVER have a very impressive and expensive vape hobby.
"Auriculotherapy worked for me. A single visit to a chiropractor, $200, a little pep talk and some electrical stimulation of nerves on my ears, and I was done. Still can’t believe it worked, been over ten years now, not a single craving."
Switching to marijuana worked for me!
"I separated the mental addiction from the physical addiction.  While still smoking I rid myself of my mental addiction.  I purposely hated my actions of smoking, hiding, skulking around as a shameful smoker.  It took me a good year before I hated myself as a smoker so much, that when I finally quit, I only had to deal with the physical addiction. By breaking up the two, each was achievable on their own.  First, hate smoking and everything that it is; second, just stop smoking.  I smoked for 25 years and have not smoked in 3 now, with zero chance of ever going bank.  "
"Yoda and a trigger.

I just like to open with that.  For me, the trigger event was my son running outside to find me while I was hiding from my kids to have a smoke.  He wanted to know what I was doing and I could already tell he wanted to try it.  So I quit.  He wants to do everything I do, so it had to go.

Then I never thought about it as *trying* to quit.  Trying implies I allow the possibility of not being good enough to succeed at it.  I just quit.  Do, or do not.  There is no try."
"I vaped for a while with mixed success ended up just vaping more than smoking, but what really helped me quit was gum, sunflower seeds, and distracting myself with something new.   I used longboarding and exploring new music, but a few friends who also were quitting tried karate, going to the gym, going back to school, and giving their products to trusted friends and not buying cigarettes again.  They did this by paying at the pump, buying groceries at the furthest register from cigarettes, etc.  Hope I helped and good luck to you, the first few weeks are the hardest!"
"I switched to menthols for a bit and then when I got a craving, i had a mint. Worked perfectly. Been smoke free since 2013! "
Do it now. Not tomorrow. Not when you finish the pack. Now even after one last cigarette - there's nothing beautiful or poignant about the last stick of toxic fumes that damages your body. Just do it right now.
"Decide why you're quitting. Truly think about the health consequences. Don't you want to grow old with your family? Do you have or plan to have kids? Visit a nursing home and find someone that has an oxygen generator with canula in their nose 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Just walking to the mailbox could be very hard. Research emphysema for the symptoms and treatment. 

Don't do it for the money. 

Do it for life. 

Good luck! "
"Hot sauce. Like scorpion pepper hot sauce. Carry a bottle around with you and some toothpicks and coat the tip of a toothpick with Satan’s liquid fire and roll that delicious magma over your tongue anytime you get a craving.

"I quit 15 years ago, I smoked for 25 years.  I used Zyban for about 8 or 9 days beforehand, and a month or so after.  I found that it took away the nicotine cravings, and left the habit for me to work on.  Some advice from a former boss that's worked for me is don't even have one cigarette, because that makes you a smoker again.  He went back and forth and eventually keeled over dead on a sidewalk while having a cigarette."
Never smoked never will. I hate smoking with a passion. My grandfather died from lung cancer caused from smoking before I ever got the chance to meet him. I went to his funeral days old. He never got to meet any of his grand children watch them grow up and do the things we have. Not only did he miss this he also hurt everyone in the family. If you can't do it for yourself do it for those that depend on you.
"I quit using Chantix,  The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr, and I went to the Website, whyquit.com to read, and watch their videos. 
I also got some 100% cranberry juice. Anytime I felt a craving I would take a swig of that. It helped with keeping my blood sugar stable. 

I've been nicotine free for 4 years.  "

So apparently if you have pretty bad liver injury your nicotine dependency goes in the toilet. For some reason people with liver disease can’t tolerate cigarettes. I learned this after developing alcohol poisoning and then finding cigarettes disgusting. 
"I don't even smoke, what am I doing here"
"First off, you have to want to. For me, after about a 20 year relationship with nicotine and approaching my 40th birthday, I was ready to break up with it. A few years back, when my kid was born, I switched to the vape. I was already down to about a cig or two a day at the time so it wasn’t hard. I discovered that I really liked vaping even more so than cigs. That became the next problem...you could do it just about anywhere and with a 30 min work commute, that’s a lot of vaping, and a new habit. Last Jan, my high school buddy and I were turning 40 ten days apart from each other and decided to sever the tie to nicotine together. I’m now 10 month nicotine free and never thought it could do it. 

So....my advice: 

1.) Start vaping. You’ll still get nicotine and will learn quickly how nasty the old habit was. Do this as long as you need until you’re ready. 
Slowly bring the nicotine levels down at your own pace. When I quit the vape, I was down to 3 milligrams.

2.) when you’re ready to stop spending so much money on vaping, switch to mini lozenges. But the 4 miligram and bite them in half when you pop one. Soon, you’ll be annoyed at how much those cost, too.

3.) replace lozenges with tic-tacs

"Smoked for 25 years.  My last cigarette was the day I got a good vape kit in the mail.  It worked great.  You just need to follow a few guidelines:

1.  Get a strong enough juice that you aren't buying cigarettes.  Once you buy the vape setup, do not buy cigarettes anymore.  The juice needs to be strong enough to sate your nicotine craving.  I started with 18mg/ml juice, some people might need to start with 24mg/ml.  Vape as much as it takes to sate your craving without having a cigarette.

2. Have a good vape kit, and a good backup kit (ideally they will be identical so you can share batteries/chargers/coils/wicks).  Buying everything you need at once (2 complete vape kits, juice, replacement coils) might cost you $150 or more, but it pays for itself in a month or less, because you're not buying cigarettes.

3. Have a plan.  Say you're going to start with 18mg/ml juice, you're going to cut your nicotine by a third every month.  So after a month on 18mg/ml, cut it to 12mg/ml juice.  Another month, 8mg/ml, and then maybe go to 3mg/ml and finally go to zero mg/ml.  At each transition, it's ok to vape more, and you'll eventually settle into it after a couple days.  For me, this part was actually really easy.

4. Once you get to zero mg/ml for a couple weeks, you are completely off nicotine.  Keep using the vape, but start occasionally leaving it in the car when you go out and see how it goes.  If you need it, it's there, but you won't.

As far as a starter vape kit, you can check out /r/electronic_cigarette for recommendations.  I have been out of the scene for a couple years, but my recommendation is get a simple kit with a built in battery that you charge just like a cell phone.  Something with a tank that you can easily refill and coils you can easily replace.  Good brand names that I remember are Innokin, SMOK, Aspire, eLeaf, although I am sure there are new brands on the scene.

Something like this would be perfect IMO: https://www.myvaporstore.com/Innokin-Coolfire-Mini-with-Zenith-D22-MTL-p/ink-cfm20.htm

Remember, you'll want TWO of these. The backup kit is super important.  Keep it charged and ready to fill all the time. When you change coils and wash your tank, fill the other one and use that one for a while. That way, if something happens to your main kit: battery dies, it gets stolen, you leave it at the bar, drop it and break the tank, whatever - you aren't forced to go buy a shitty Juul at the gas station or even worse, a pack of cigarettes.

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me.  I got into building my own coils and mixing my own juice, so I can probably answer it."
Gum did it for me. Not even nicotine gum just regular old orbit or eclipse. I am completely addicted to gum now but atleast it’s somewhat of a healthier alternative...
"Sunflower seeds. I think that mainly worked for me because I chose chew as an alternative and had to quit that, but just the motion of bringing something to your mouth and keeping it occupied works. Also, don't vape.  "
"You have to absolutely be ready to quit! Just do the calculation of financial benefits of quitting. A pack a day in Texas is about $8! Multiply that by 30! At least $240 a month!
 Then think about the health benefits of quitting. You breath easier. Your taste of food gets better! I noticed after I quit how good things taste now! Which in turn caused me to gain a little weight because your metabolism slows down after a change like that to your body! You know you're less susceptible to viruses and bacteria if you quit because your lungs, heart, asophagus, etc won't be trying to regenerate themselves from the damage of smoking. I don't even have to mention the long term health effects! 
Lastly, and not really most importantly, think about the social benefits. It seemed to me that it was beginning to be a pain in the ass to be a smoker. Most restaurants and bars don't allow it. Most people don't want smoke in their homes or cars. Most people don't want smoking around their kids or especially babies. Your days of stopping the car to smoke on long trips and standing in the rain to get a quick smoke in are over! 
My point is to REALLY be ready to quit! Because you're not trying to convince other people! You're trying to convince yourself! Don't try to lie to yourself! It's pointless and redundant. So when you know you're ready, JUST QUIT! COLD TURKEY! It's the only way! Don't vape or use patches and gum. Don't dip or chew or switch to cigars only! Those are just other habits youre trading cigarettes for! None of them are beneficial! None! JUST. QUIT. "

"Don’t tell anyone!

That was literally the one thing I did different that worked. Just don’t tell anyone that you’re quitting. Wait for them to bring it up. Delay that gratification as long as you can."
"I used the nicotine patch - the Walmart brand. I wore it 24/7, only taking it off when I showered. It takes the urge away, but I had trouble with the after meal smoke. I smoked with the patch on, didn't get the buzz, so it was easier to eventually give them up. The patch deals with the addiction. The habit is a bit harder. I took up doing crossword puzzles to keep my hands busy. I also didn't follow the time frame for switching strengths. I was paranoid that I would relapse if I went to a weaker patch. I did it in my own time and have been smoke free for 2 yrs. This was my second attempt at quitting. "
"Smoke-free for almost 11 years. Chantix got me through the first month and made smoking positively disgusting. I had to bail after the month because my stomach didn't react to the pill well, but after that first month it wasn't too bad.

One mental exercise that got me through a lot of cravings was to mentally tally up how many days it had been since my last cigarette if I got hit with a particularly strong urge. It had the 2 pronged effect of temporarily distracting me for a minute or two while I counted days while laying out exactly what I was going to be losing if I cracked. Once that number got up over 50 or 60 days, failure wasn't an option anymore."
"According to my dad, it's moving somewhere with cold winters. He quit about three months into the Michigan winter after we moved from Florida. "
"Just stop.
If that doesn't get through to you then you're trying too hard."
"Get a deep cleaning at the dentist. 

I started smoking when I was 14. By the time I was in my late 20's a pack could last me from 3 days to a week (more if I wasn't drinking). And I was mostly using e-cigs, those little single black ones that lit up at the end.  I hadn't been to the dentist in over a decade and when I finally worked up the nerve to go (at 34), the cleaning this woman gave me had me gripping the arm rests like I was on a plane with engine trouble. I could see flecks of blood flying out of my mouth. Still, my mouth felt so good.

When she was done she asked ""Do you smoke?"" I said ""I think I just quit"" and I was joking but I didn't touch another cigarette again. I probably would have slowed to a stop eventually but that dentist visit did it for me in one go. 20 years of smoking, done. I just turned 38 last week, so it's been 4 years and I don't miss it at all and I can't stand the way smokers smell (and feel so much shame over knowing I reeked like that for so long). 

My husband quit because I told him I wouldn't marry him unless he did. He misses it a lot though (he smoked way more than I did).

Edit: I'd say try to stay away from your triggers in the beginning. I could go through a whole pack in one night if I was getting drunk, so I just drank a lot less and less often until I was sure I was done with it."
"I divided it into steps. First I tackled my addiction to the breaks that cigarettes provided me, then the oral fixation, then the actual nicotine addiction. 
I started by transitioning from cigarettes to vaping. This meant I could Vape inside which help me get over the feeling of having to go outside for a break to smoke a cigarette. at first I missed the brakes but I realized after a while how much time they took out of my life. 
After I was vaping for a couple months and have gotten over the withdrawal of cigarettes I transitioned to the patches. that way I still have nicotine in my system but I could get over the oral fixation. It only took me a couple weeks to stop chewing my fingers off and by the time I got to the lowest level patch I knew I could do it. The first two or three days without the patch was hard because I had no nicotine in my system but I had been gradually reducing the level of nicotine using the patches so my body and mind could handle it!"
"Quit cold turkey realizing the truth is that you won’t die from withdrawal (you’re actually getting healthier by quitting), you don’t need cigarettes to handle stressful situations, you won’t smell like an ashtray, and you’re saving tons of money. "
"It’s not serious advice, but my mom quit after getting knocked up. I was an accident, so my mom quit cold turkey when she found out she was pregnant. 

Don’t get knocked up, but she says it’s the best thing that happened to her bc she quit that and drinking cold turkey. 
"
"Be sure you actually really want to quit, that's the most important thing.  If you're half assing it then it will never work.

For the first 2 weeks stay away from any triggers you have, i quit drinking and going out for example since i mostly smoked when i drank.  I would get home, exercise, eat and go to bed earlier than usual.  Take yourself out of your routine for a bit.  Quitting is only really difficult for the first 2 weeks."
I didn’t smoke but my dad a few weeks ago flat out quit. I came home from school and he told me to go out and buy lobster tails to mark the event that he quitted smoking. His reason was witnessing his brother passing away due to lung cancer and seeing his brothers wife and kids suffer the lost. I guess he doesn’t want my mom and I to go through the same thing. It was a big decision on his part and I am really proud.
"What helped me quit is that I had switched from store-bought packs to roll-your-own with less ""tasty"" tobacco. Once I got sick of smoking, the harshness of the cigs was enough of a turnoff that it was relatively easy to taper off and finally go cold turkey.

I wasn't a heavy smoker to begin with, though; just 5 or 6 cigarettes per day. And I had a few setbacks when I gave into cravings and bought myself those flavored cigarillos."
"Cold Turkey and pure will. 

Survive the first two weeks and you'll be shocked at how much you don't want a cigarette.  

I quit 646 days ago and it's the best thing I ever did. Now, anytime I smell a smoke I'm disgusted. I don't necessarily mind it, but it's just not for me anymore."
"I managed to do it in 2 years with vaping.  
Buy one of the proper mods, that makes good cloud and add a lot of nicotine to it.  
Keep at it for as long as it takes for you to start hating cigarettes.  
For me it was 6 months when the smell of tobacco started to stink.  
Slowly reduce the nicotine in it as time goes on.  
The next big jump is going from little nicotine to no nicotine.  
After 6 months of vaping no nicotine I started to forget my vape and didn't care I did.  
Now I'm clean

Move to a location with horrible air quality - Feel the sharp pain in your chest that comes with every drag.  Take notice of the slightly blood-clotty crap that you're coughing from your lungs.  That's what finally made me quit after 10 years of smoking.  It wasn't intended but it definitely motivated me to never smoke again.
"Hey ex-smokers whadda ya think of this. 
I smoke around 65 king-sized smokes a day. My woman is due in April and we always agreed that I would quit before we had a kid. I love smoking it's literally my favorite activity. Ive been an over two packs a day guy since 2012. I want to quit before 2019 so I've been reducing my smokes by a smoke or two a day. Do you guys think this will work for me? I know I can't do it cold turkey. I tried in the summer and lasted less than a day. I've tailored my life to make my smoking addiction easy. I work out doors and do a lot of driving for work. Every thing people have told me so far has failed to phase me. It gets super cold here in winter, I just convinced my self that I don't mind. I spend $16 dollars every 25 ciggarettes, convinced myself that I would just spend the money poorly any way. I'm over weight and athsmatic and was that way before I started so the health effects don't bother me too much cause I was always out of breath quick. Some times I think smoking is part of my personality, part of what makes me,me. I like having a reason to go outside during almost any event. I wonder if smoking is why I'm a patient person. I wonder if I'd still love my job if I couldn't smoke. I wonder if I'd still be funny, or if I'd be so friendly if I didn't smoke.

Do you guys think I can quit if I go slowly or am I better off getting an RX? I tried vaping a couple years ago, that wasn't an improvement ( I Vaped like 40ml a day at 6mg) and ended up getting really sick( I don't know if it was from the vape or not but I can't handle it any more. I like the gum and use it when I fly or when I know I won't be able to smoke for a few hours. 

I'm terrified of chantix, I've heard of so many people having problems in real life because of their dreams and I don't want to not be me. 

Bottom line I guess is I have to quit. I don't know if any smoker ever wants to quit and I've given up on the idea that I'd ever want to quit. I don't think I'd ever be ready to say fuck smoking, or that I hate it. I've always liked the smell of burning tobacco, and I don't think that's going to go away. But I hope that by slowly reducing the amount I smoke I'll be able to cut it out maybe with the help of gum before the end of the year. Please let me know if any one here quit that way and if it worked.

"Not me, but I do have a good experience.

I had a customer who was trying to quit. He quit the night before. Woke up and he felt great. Went to work, went to do some calls. Suddenly he realized that out of habbit, he had pulled out a cig, lit it, and was smoking as he was talking.

It's not so much the physical addiction as it was the habbit and structure it provides."
Just don’t
"Cold turkey baby. The best way imo. Just decide your done and that's it. Yes you will get cravings but just say ""no I am done."" That's how I quit."
"Gum

Whenever I wanted to smoke I’d chew gum instead"
"Hopefully I don't get too buried in this.  Here are the main points that I felt help me when I quit.

* Try to remove the association of stress=smoke break.  If you can avoid this relation, then when you have a rough phone call, or get bad news, you're willpower will be at it's lowest, and you don't want to cave in right then.
* Don't buy them.  If you don't have any, you can't smoke any.  I also **hated** ""bumming"" / borrowing smokes from other people, so if I didn't have them, then I'm not going to have one.
* Find something else to do with your hands.  Fidget spinner or anything else that you can play with.  Right now, almost 20 years from when I quit, I still find I can fidget with stuff a lot (paper, pens, caps, etc).
* If you do cave, that's fine. The world hasn't ended.  Just get back up and try again as soon as you can.  If you do it smoke today, stop again tomorrow.  YOU CAN DO IT.

Warnings of some of the stuff that will shock you (good and bad).

* Smelling stuff.  Give it a few weeks.  You're going to start to smell a lot of stuff. Your sense of smell sucks right now, and when that comes back you'll notice a lot of things that you never could. Especially how much another smoker actually smells.  With any luck, this will gross you out.  :)
* I'd say within the first week of no smoking, you'll start to notice that you aren't coughing up lung butter daily.  
* You will have dreams of smoking.  These can often be disturbing, and I can still recall one from years ago that when I woke up, I checked the pockets to my jacket and was shocked that I didn't have a pack of smokes in there.  The dream was so vivid that I had been smoking again.
* Months and even years after.  You will get some pretty out of the blue cravings to smoke again. Resist it, they will slow down to become pretty rare.
* People recommend food/nuts to help with cravings, but this is also something that leads people to think that ""smoking = skinny"".  You can easily get yourself into a bad weight gain habit if you aren't careful.  Instead of sunflower seeds or nuts, do strawberries, apples, pears, or even sugarless gum.  This will keep your hands busy, and mouth chewing to help get you through the bad part.

I had quit for over a decade, and 2 years ago I started having a few cigars ""once in a while"".  Next thing I'm getting Colts for cigars instead of nice cubans, but I'm smoking one or two almost daily.  That quickly turned up to daily, and 3-4 times, and next thing you know a pack (8) of colts a day.  I get a ""chest cold"", and I can't get rid of a damn cough for 6 weeks, just to get another.  Finally realized I was being dumb, quit those nasty things, and no more issues."
E-cigarettes without nicotine.
"Remember that quitting smoking is a process, not an event. If you slip up, don't give up. Even if you slip up a year later don't beat yourself up. You're human and you're likely to struggle. You will get to a point where you can't even stand the smell of them.

You're making the right choice! And hey, it will be difficult but u got dis! ;)

Cold turkey was the only way I was finally able to fully stop. Don't try vapes of slowly stopping just stop all together. 
"I would pop a werther's hard candy anytime I had a craving. When ever my coworkers or friends would go out for a smoke, I would still go but not smoke and just enjoy my candy. I didn't change any other part of my life or routine during that first 6 months of quitting. 

I quit cold turkey in March 2016. This spring is 3 years! "
"Exercise and switching to vape. Been around 3 months so far. When I misplaced my vape and all of my coworkers smoke it’s gets really hard. I work in the restaurant industry, seriously the only time you get a break. It’s been a struggle, but I feel better. Just bummed about all of the money I spent over the past 8 years I smoked."
"Water, water is your friend."
"Okay so it took several tries, but I ended up using the nicotine patch, and then I'd chew Orbitz gum all day, and I'd chew on those little plastic straws you get if you buy cheap lollypops, they would keep my mouth occupied after meals, when I was sick of the gum. "
"I quit using two things.

1. 'The easy way to stop smoking' by Alan Carr. Decide before you start reading that your going to believe what he says. You can evaluate its truthfulness after you have quit for a long time. One drag of one cigarette kills all the work you have done to quit to that point.

2. Nicotine patches. I bought the most potent ones and then cut them in half rather than spending more buying weaker patches.

FWIW im 37 and smoked from 15 to 31."
"I used to smoke near a pack a day and the wife had a baby on the way. Between worrying about him and adding up how much I spent I figured I needed to quit. However, cold turkey isn't my style and I liked the idea of vaping. I had tried it before but never kept with it. However, when i became determined to swap I had to find the nicotine level I was used to. Started at 12mg of nic and have dialed it down to 6. But when I found that sweet spot at 12 I had no cravings for a cigarette. My brother and mother still smoke so I tried a cig about a week into vaping and put it out immediately. I no longer enjoyed the taste and had no desire to smoke. Now I gotta kick vaping but at least I'm bringing the nic down. Hope this helps. 

Edit: Smoke free for 2+ years, no cravings outside nostalgia. Now gotta reign the vape in.

TL:DR Find a reason to quit that you can't shake, vaping can help kick the habit but to start with no cravings find the right nicotine level that you are used to. Also add up how much you spend and ask yourself what you'd do with that money. These helped me. Your mileage may vary"
I started to feel like smoking was actually killing me so I switched to using snus.
It’s 15 days in 5 hours. For me it was my sexual performance 
"For me, it was the money factor. When I saw that I was spending around $300 per month on cigarettes, I realized that my money could be better served in a savings account. So, I quit cold turkey. That was in August of 2009 and I've never looked back."
"For me it wasn't too hard, just because I don't like the taste it leaves in my mouth. "
"Don't hang out wirh people who smoke. 

I started thinking of my cravings as pathetic weakness and started to almost enjoy the burning intensity of them. Almost. 

"
Vape.
"What worked for me, was weaning myself down from a pack of full flavors a day to 5 Parliament ultra-lights a day, over the course of a couple of months.  after about two weeks of ultra-lights  it was like ""why am I even doing this anymore?""  It was inconvenient, I wasn't getting anything out of it anymore, It became a chore, the ultra-lights were so weak it tasted like breathing in someone else's 2nd hand smoke, eventually I just stopped.
"
Don't allow friends or associates to smoke around you. Refuse to be around them if they're going to.
"think of smoking as a habit instead of an addiction.

be honest with yourself and write down *why* you smoke.

There should be a number of triggers that make you want to smoke. 

recognize these triggers and avoid as many as you can while preparing to replace smoking with something else to appease the trigger.

for me i smoked because i needed a reprieve from my monotonous cubicle job. So when the cube walls were getting to me i would step out for a smoke break as usual but just not smoke... i would just stare at a tree and enjoy being outside for a couple minute then go back to work. i did similar stuff for all my other smoking triggers and boom no more cigs.

"
"Find something to do for the first week of quitting, backpacking, new game, have a kid, anything that will occupy your time for the week. I personally wasn't quitting, only ""stopping"" to lower my nicotine craving. Ended up quitting, but the first week was the hardest, after that everything else was pretty easy. Also, don't hang out with smokers for the first month, too many people get offered one and they then rationalize, ""one won't hurt""."
Don't start it in the first place
Never give up.  Interpret that however you want.
Don't buy cigarettes
"Never try to quit smoking. 

Do or do not. There is no try. "
"If my roommate is anything to go by, just experience some considerable headtrauma."
"Don't really have any tips for cigarettes specifically, but I've quit much heavier stuff... 

My advice is this: Decide what you want to do, then just keep going until you get there. Be like a runaway freight train, don't let anything stop you! 

Being a bitch at work? Keep going. Your health is worth a lot more than your coworkers workday.

Constipated? Keep going. Pain is temporary, victory is forever.

No patience with your kids? Keep going. A month with a grumpy parent won't kill them, especially if it means adding 10 years to your life.

Make a routine that you follow each day, no matter what, and believe in it! I had so many days  where I just couldn't find a reason to get out of bed, and days where I couldn't find a reason not to kill myself. But I had my routine. Get up, go to work, make dinner, tuck my son in, write diary, go to bed. Day in, day out. I believed in that, if I just stuck to it eventually things would get better. And they sure did! Holy fuck what a difference it is between then and now! Was a long road well worth walking. 

If *I* could do that, every single one of you can quit smoking on the spot the moment you just really *decide* to. Don't put it off waiting for ""the right time"". You already have it in you, might as well do it now and minimize the damage! "
"I switched to an e cigarette for several months, then briefly to nicotine gum, then weaned myself off the gum."
"I hated smoking for years but couldnt quit, 1 day I took some shrooms and when I got home in the morning I was staring at the beautiful flower in my yard. I looked at my pack of smokes and tossed them out. A couple of months later I was in Vegas partying and was drunk and grabbed a cig from my mate, once I took a puff it grossed me out and I tossed it. Never smoked again after that. "
"Smoke the last cigarette of your pack before you go to bed. It's really hard to quit if you have smokes left over in the morning. I woke up, had none left, and decided I wasn't gonna buy anymore. This was after like 10 or more attempts at quitting mind you. Perseverance is really the key."
"GET A VAPE

I'm not kidding, I bought one of these and never looked back. I bought one that isn't lunchbox sized and got the lowest level of nicotine and it's great.

Pro-tip: Tabacco flavour is terrible"
"Remove places from your habitual smoking.

I bought a new car, no smoking in it. 

I moved. Only smoked outside from then on.

I weened off of smoking at work. 

At that point I was down to less than half a pack everyday. At one point I smoked 2 packs a day. After a while I just didn't have the same attachment as I used to and I was done.

In my anecdotal experience you have to want to not smoke. Nobody I know personally that quit under duress while still ""a smoker"" succeeded. Those of us that did were done being smokers."
"there are no tips,no shortuts,decide you are never going to smoke again,and donr smoke again,there are the only 2 steps"
"If youre asking this, youre already on your way. It was a combination of things that did it for me: being conscious of when im not enjoying smoking; noticing the effects on my skin, smell, lung capacity; and this sounds silly but realizing I was addicted. I would picture my ideal self, and that self was never smoking. Once you make the decision, you stick with it. It's that simple. I don't have any coping mechanisms for the period immediately after quitting, I just stayed busy to keep my mind occupied. You can do this! "
"CBD oil. Not kidding.

I started vaping 550mg strength CBD oil, and I stopped a nastly nicotine habit overnight. "
I'm 5 years without a cigarette. I did it cold turkey. My biggest tip is that you have to want to quit smoking. Not just you need or should quit but actually want too. Because like most life changes it takes a lot of determination and discipline. It's easier to change if you actually want too.
"A lot of good advice in this thread, some will work for you, some won't.

My advice: replace it with something. In my case: exercise. When I got to the point where I couldn't resist the urge anymore, I'd run for a bit (didn't take much to be exhausted at that time of my life :) ) or do some push-ups. As an outlet for the aggressive feelings of withdrawal.

It's a serious addiction you're fighting here. And make no mistake, it's a fight to the death and so far the addiction has been winning. Now you decide fight back to come out on top. It (the addiction) will do anything it can to beat you, even put thoughts in your head that make it ok to smoke. So you need something to fight back and for me that was it."
Just stop. Think ur brain as an enemy. Gain control over it. Everytime you smoke you loose control over YOURSELF. What is more important? you having control over your hands or some enemy controlling your body. Also think about body as a property. And you staying in it. Everytime you smoke you loose possession of your house. 
Not for everyone but weed worked for me.
It's that 4th day.  Make it through that and you're good. 
It’s all in your head. Find the off button. Worked for me😊😆
Tyrone slapped my cigarette
"1. Really, *really*, want to quit.
1. Have a strong personal reason to quit.
1. Cut back slowly before your target quit date.  
1. Do not cave and smoke, but, allow yourself nicotine through other means when you need to. The nicorette inhaler worked well for me. Personal preference. Slowly reduce your reliance on these things and your cravings will lessen.
1. Understand that you may need to attempt quitting multiple times.  It took me 3 serious efforts, where I lasted up to 1 year before going back.  
1. Train your brain and nose that smoking stinks and is gross and you don't want it anymore.  
1. Smoke a ton of weed or dabs as an offset :P lol"
It may take many tries. I'm going on two years after this month without a cigarette but it took me about 10 serious tries of a week to a few months then relapse to finally get it.
I just got so sick I had to stop. Have you tried Strep? or AIDS?
Switch brands a lot before your planned quit date. Smoke a brand that tastes bad to you.
"I used to be a 2 pack per day smoker. I knew I could not go cold turkey, so I took drastic steps to reduce then stop.

Every week I did halves, as in: 

- Week one, one pack/day
- Week two, 1/2 pack/day
- Week three, 1/4 pack/day 
- Week four, two smokes/day
- Week five, one a day
- Week six-seven, one or two the whole week
- By week eight, I was done. 

I was an exec chef at the time, and the thing that stuck me the most, aside from being able to breathe and no longer hacking up lung butter, was within a couple of weeks, food tasted soooo much better to me. 

Been almost ten years, and have not looked back since.

Now when I smell smoke, I almost gag. So gross smelling to me now. "
"Want it. 

I weaned off them over several months. The less I smoked the less I liked smoking. I hate the taste and smell now. 


I didn't have any help. I went from a pack, to half a pack, to just a few a day,  then thought, ""why am I still doing this "" and stopped one day"
"Identify your triggers and eliminate them at least until you are fully over smoking. For me, it was drinking alcoholic beverages. I cut back my drinking significantly at first and then completely eliminated until I kicked smoking. The last time I tried smoking while drinking after not being addicted to cigarettes (at least 5 years ago), it felt awful. Now, I can drink alcoholic beverages with zero interest in smoking. In fact, it's also caused me to drink less, because drinking doesn't feel as good now without the cigarettes. Now I'll drink alcoholic beverages only in moderation and only if they taste good. Sometimes coffee is a trigger for people. Stop drinking it or switch to another form of caffeine. Sometimes its friends. If it's a friend, you need to spend less time with those friends or ask those friends to not smoke around you and do things with each other that aren't conducive to smoking. Make smoking inconvenient for yourself by staying away from places that allow smoking. If you smoke in your house, make it a rule that you can't smoke indoors. For me, living in Minnesota really worked because it would be so damn cold out that you didn't want to deal with it. You need to make strict rules and follow them.

Also know that most people don't smoke and that they can smell smoke on you and in your house, even if you can't smell it. It smells worse than you think. You don't want people to think you're smelly. A lot of people will also think that you're stupid/trashy for smoking. Most people don't know that it's not because you're stupid/trashy, it's just easy to become addicted to and extremely hard to quit. You'll also start to look and sound worse (sullen, wrinkly, raspy) and people will know you're a smoker. If the stuff I mentioned above doesn't work, then maybe the public shame factor will.

Think of all of that money you're blowing on cigarettes. I remember feeling rich after I stopped smoking. Right now, you are wasting a ton of money on something that isn't even worth the cost and will cost you even more down the line.

Finally, you have to want to quit."
Keep reminding yourself you can't afford it anymore and it will kill you.
I got the e-cig (before everything was called vape this or that) and gradually reduced the nicotine content over the course of about a year and then just gave it up.
"It can only be cold turkey.  I took a smoking cessation class, and the accountability was key to getting me starting.

Expect to gain weight - it'll be OK.

I had to stop watching movies from the 30s-70's.   All the smoking got to me - I even had to stop watching AbFab for the same reason.

Long term - you will cheat.  You will go through times where you pick it up again for a few months then you quit again etc...  Eventually you learn to fear withdrawal more then crave the cigarettes.  That said, it took ten years for the cravings to go away completely.

I suggest you look at pictures of lungs that have been affected by smoking related diseases.  COPD, Emphysema, and of course cancer.   That is reality, and it is a natural progression from smoking.  Sure, there are those people who are 102 and smoked 5 packs a day unfiltered since they were 9, but they are the genetic freaks.  That is not the normal course.

Good luck and stay strong."

"The physical addiction will go away if you quit smoking for 2 weeks. The mental addiction stays for much longer, and you essentially have to forget why smoking is desirable. I'm at about 6 months without smoking and still sort of have the desire, but it's much weaker than when I was 1-2 months in. 

I'm trying to avoid casual smoking, so that I will hopefully get rid of all desire to smoke. I guess that's my advice, don't slip up and eventually you'll forget the desire after a year or two. I think I've reached the point where alcohol no longer increases the craving, and that's huge for me. "
"I had tried quitting twice but failed. Being in France did not help. And I really wanted to quit. 
In a last ditch attempt gave control to a friend to slap me if I smoked. And we’re honest to each other. I was to do the same to him if he drank more than two glasses of anything. The fear and embarrassment of getting slapped in public saved me. Quit cold turkey. I although got two chances of slapping him!
Not been long but it’s been four months and going strong!"
"Smoked for a little over 20 years. Tried many times to quit. Chantix worked once but after 8 months went over to best friends place for a party. Friend smoked and the drinking ended that 8 months. On one attempt to quit, I've gotten home and realized only then I had bought a pack at the gas station I always use on the way home.

Not everyone is able to do what I did and move out of the country but I believe it comes down to one thing. Habits. The addiction and withdrawal part only lasts few days. What messes you up is the habit it anything/person that reminds you of it. 
Lighter in the pocket, yup.
Ash tray at home.
Stop at same store on the way home, always get a pack right.
Friends not helping.

When I moved a got rid of everything before the flight and didn't tell anyone I smoked when I got here. Made it so easy. Five years now not so much as a twitch."
"This will probably get buried, but for me it was when my friend started realizing he needed to quit. We had started smoking at basically the same time, just for fun at first, but over time it got to the point where he was starting to get pretty substantial cravings whenever he went without a smoke. I was lucky that I hadn’t developed those cravings yet, but it was a wake up call that I needed to stop before I did. 

Even without the physiologic addiction though, quitting was still tough. I’m a pretty anxious person, and without meaning to I had let cigarettes become one of the main ways I dealt with stress. Smoking gave me an excuse to take a break and have some personal time at a point in my life when I didn’t feel comfortable asking for either of those things. Also, being able to do something with my hands was a great way to vent some of my pent up nervous energy. Ultimately, it was a combo of therapy and altoids smalls that helped me quit. I was able to replace at least some of what cigarettes gave me with the mints, and the therapy helped with some of the underlying issues that made smoking such a tempting stress reliever to begin with."
"My last cigarette was september 4th. At a pack a day, for $6 a pack, I've saved $228.

Monetary gain was a huge motivator for me."
"I smoked cigarettes for 2 years before I decided to try to quit. I succeeded even though I lived with my girlfriend who smoked half a pack a day. after quitting too quickly (cold turkey) and relapsing a handful of times, I decided to take it slower on the next try. I gradually switched from cigarettes to a vape pen over a couple of weeks. at first, i didn't change my smoking habits, just added the vape. I would still take time to go sit on the porch and vape because on previous quitting attempts, I had missed the ritual of taking 10 minutes to sit quietly outside. before long though, being able to vape and get my nicotine fix indoors got me more hooked on vaping than cigs after a few days (it was winter and I lived in a rental).  at first my nicotine consumption went up bc I was vaping all day, but I stuck with my plan. rather than focusing on what I couldn't have (""no more cigarettes today""), I focused on an alternate/replacement that I could have, that still gave me the buzz I was after, and was still enjoyable to use. once I got used to reaching for the vape instead of the cigarettes when I got a craving, it was super easy to gradually taper off of my nicotine addiction. every time I refilled the tank on the pen, I added a few drops of flavorless, nicotine-free vaping liquid, then a few more the next time. first 5 drops, then 10, and so on. after a couple of weeks there was hardly any nicotine in the tank, and also hardly any flavor.
the reduction of nicotine wasn't dependent on a change in behavior. I allowed myself to vape as much as I wanted and still gave myself quiet outside time. it didn't feel like I was suddenly missing something. I didn't have to change my habits much and I didn't get hit by intense cravings. vaping just got slowly, steadily less fun and gave me less of a buzz as I added more and more nicotine-free liquid. I guess the key for me was to quit gently and gradually.

TL;DR
kept smoking, added vaping, phased out smoking, gradually diluted vaping liquid containing nicotine with nicotine-free vaping liquid. haven't smoked in 3 years."

Everything you do is worthless unless you truly believe you can quit. You can do it!"
Decide that you really want to commit never to smoke again. That's the biggest one. Practice saying no to yourself when you have urges. It gets easier with practice. Realize and admit to yourself that there is no such thing as just this one cigarette. It will snowball.
"Think about how bad you  smell to others  when you smoke, and call cigarettes stinkies. Also start using a vape instead and ween yourself off if cold turkey doesn't work. Cigarettes have more than just nicotine that is addictive, often its harder to quit those than the nicotine itself. "

"Buy a new car, your monthly smoking habit pays off your monthly payment, back in 2001 I purchase a new SUV and my monthly was $600, I was spending ~ $300 per month on cigs, I've quit a couple of times but this made it stick."
"I switched to vaping. I was already at the point where I couldn't stand to smoke another cigarette but my brain wouldn't let me go without the nicotine. I switched to a vape pen with 18mg nic. It was a terrible experience but ultimately helped me quit. I would sit around playing skyrim for hours on end and vape to my hearts content. I didn't have to step outside and it didn't make me feel like I was sucking car exhaust and coughing until I puked every morning.

I went a little overboard because I would lose track of how much I was vaping and my brain loved all the nicotine.

I started feeling sick but I figured it was unrelated and kept on vaping like a madman. I got worse until eventually I couldn't get out of bed. I blacked out and woke up 3 days later. I gave myself nicotine poisoning and possibly almost died. After that I have never touched either cigarettes or vapes and I have absolutely no desire to.

My advice is to switch to a less harmful nicotine delivery system but do not go overboard. Switch to vaping with a LOW nicotine dosage or get gum or a patch and ween yourself off. You will feel so much better after you quit and the thought of smoking a cigarette now makes me feel sick."

I literally pretend (when nobody is lookinga round) to smoke a cigarette, even going as far as using my right hand (i'm left handed, but i smoked with my right), and taking a deep breath. This literally felt like 90% of the smoking!

also, don't hang out with your smoking friends, and finally, quit drinking also. Your gaurds will go down if you drink."
"Read Alan Carr. 

Listen to YouTube hypnotherapy stuff, it’s more guided meditation but helps.

Go cold turkey, no gum etc, I tried many times before cracking this.

Chew gum after meals and when you crave it.

Fall 6 rise 7. 
Aka don’t give up, your cravings go away after 6 months (mostly) and after a year almost completely.

Source : I quit 8 years ago after too many attempts. Best thing I did."
"Move somewhere cold, I wasnt even actively trying to quit when I did, but being somewhere that it was ~-45° with the wind chill and not being able to smoke inside you realize real quick that smoke ain't worth it"
"You fucked up starting smoking, you're gonna have that monkey on your back the rest of your life. Too bad, you can't do it anymore. You are going to want to. You can't. From this moment on, you can't smoke. If you had quit a year ago you would have been done for a year now, this time next year you are going to be happy you didn't let it go another year."
"Don't quit. Don't plan to quit. Because you already smoked your last cigarette last night. You'll never smoke another one. You're not going to quit, because you've already quit. Smoke free 6 months. "
"I went the e-cig path after 20 years of smoking.  I got a POS for my first one, but then finally got a decent setup for my 2nd one.  That was 5 years ago.  My last analogue cig was almost 2 years ago (I'd occasionally have one after a REALLY rough day).   


I still use my e-Cig, so I haven't 100% quit - but I'm healthier in general.  I can breath easier, I have a bit more energy, coughing spasms are gone.    


I found I had to make a mental change to make it take effect too.  I was in a crappy place in my life, and this was one of a few changes I made to try and better myself all around the same time.

&#x200B;"
"It sounds super captain obvious-y looking back, but in addition to a cessation aid (patch) I had to start *thinking* of myself as a non-smoker.  Smoking becomes such a part of your identity, something people associate with you, and changing that behavior entails changing your conception of who you are, and how you fill the moment-to-moment windows that would usually result in going out to have a smoke.

More than once I had an internal conversation where I'd be thinking ""Hmm, I could go for a cigarette right now"", before catching myself and thinking ""Wait, no I don't - I'm a non-smoker.""  The patch helped a lot too."
"I tapered off little by little. Went from a pack a day to half a pack a day, to 3-4 to none."
"I quit cold turkey in 2010 after smoking for 9 years. Went to a party one night and smoked too much. Woke up next morning with bad hangover and shot lungs. Didn't have a smoke that day. Woke up the next day and decided to not have a smoke that day either and see how long I can make it. Haven't had a cigarette since August 2010.

Just do it, yo. Take it one day at a time. Don't be thinking about the next day. When you feel like having a cigarette, just don't have one. That's my advice, lol. It's not that hard."
"Cut the caffeine until the cravings aren't tearing you apart anymore. Caffeine intensified the cravings and once I stopped that, it was......easier"
"Got a few here

Don't force yourself to just quit one day while still smoking frequently. You'll crave that last cigarette you didn't have and are more likely to cave. 

Just smoke less over time. It can be a month, 6 months, doesn't matter as long as you're smoking less. You can do this by being conscious of when and why you smoke, and get stricter with yourself over time. 

Eventually cigarettes will start tasting like shit,  because they do. You'll force yourself to smoke a couple per day because the thought of not having one is frightening. 

That's the point at which you can stop and you won't miss them at all. 

Not smoking while drinking is the hard part. Took me 2 years but doesn't matter because forever is longer.

Perfect thread. I plan to quit on Monday. 
"Gradually ween your way off of it.

Smoke 4 cigarettes for two days.

Then 3.

Then 2.

Then 1.

Also just image the disgusting picture of smoke resting inside of your lungs and after a little bit your brain will subconsciously associate this negative image with smoking and your desire will disappear.

Also you could do more cardio, nothing's a bigger motivator when you run a mile and start gasping for air. Immediate consequences."
"Not a smoker, but use a Juul, and do it less and less every day. Example 100 puffs, 98, 96, and so on. Eventually your habit will improve, cheaper than those Nicorette patches."
"
Checking in - smoker for 20 years. 

I tried gum, patch but always went back.
First time trying out chantix and it seems to be doing the working so far. 
30 days  smoke free today.  I take 1 mg  a day. 



"
"You gotta quit every habit. I quit for months and hadn’t had any but I went back to school and found out I hadn’t quit the after class habit yet! One step at a time. 

Deep breaths and lots of food."
"*Want* to quit. I mean really want to quit. The will power to not feel like shit was my driving force and the only way I got through it. 

**Fisherman's Friend-** It's a brand of throat lozenge that is outrageously menthol. Eating one after every meal and as soon as I got in the truck curbed my cravings pretty quick. Breaking up that cyclical behavior is the second key to really quitting. "
"Just fucking quit.

I know everyone's different, but I think I've read that the single most successful way to quit is to go cold turkey. That's what I did.

Also, you can try to think about how much you won't fucking reek anymore. Yes, you reek. And yes, it has annoyed people. "
"I haven't had a smoke in 3 years. I want to let it be known that the urge never goes away, it only decreases. I was miserable for a good several months in the first year. Now its just a ""oh that'd be nice right now"" thought and then saying nah. But you can't do it alone. I lived on a college campus being a student at the time, and every corner had students taking bogey break constantly. No addict can fight the urge unless you have inhuman will power. You need friends and or family to keep you accountable. Good luck."
"Wean yourself down to the essential cigs as much as possible. For me that was three a day, wake up, a stress cig sometime midday or after work if it was a good day and a before bed one. 

I heard someone, maybe on a podcast can’t remember, talking about how although everyone knows that smoking is bad for you in the abstract it’s difficult to really comprehend or convince ourselves of the damage we are doing to ourselves in the moment. It helped me to visualize how many cigs I smoked a day and how that translated into the packs I had smoked over my life.  I tried to envision the pile that made and that every or any single one of of those could be the one to give me cancer and kill me. I really tried to take that in and to consider my habit as actively trying to harm myself. 

Then I took it day by day. My then boyfriend hated me smoking so on his birthday I didn’t smoke. It was tough but I made it. Then I thought “you know I did it yesterday, let me just see if I can do it today” and on and on. Till I made it a week. I even thought maybe I’d reward myself if I made it to a week with one but then I made it to a week and thought fuck that let me see I can do another week. And another. 

I haven’t touched one since. Stressful situations make it hard - try five minutes of meditation or a brisk walk or really anything else first before giving in. Just try to make it a little longer and longer. Try not giving in. Also if you are like me and a social smoker you might have to lay off the booze for a while. The hootch makes it so much harder to keep your resolve. 

Good luck!! You can do it!"
"I smoked cigarettes for 9 years, & am coming up on 5 months being smoke free. I was smoking a cigarette with my friend one morning, took a few drags & realized that I just didn’t want to do it anymore. Started to realize how it was affecting me, as I would wake up with chest pains & my mouth feeling dry & disgusting. Decided to quit cold turkey, only reason I was able to do so was because I knew 100% that I wanted to quit. That aspect of addiction is probably the toughest thing to overcome. It’s much harder if you still desire to smoke, luckily enough for me I no longer felt that way. Went through nearly 2 weeks of withdrawal & dealt with nausea/vomiting, massive headaches/body aches, fatigue, & loss of appetite. It certainly sucked, but not once did I even crave a cigarette during that time. I feel so much better having quit, & cigarettes don’t even cross my mind anymore. Mental & physical health have definitely improved over the last half year as a result. "
Toothpick in your mouth.
"Vape.

You can start with something like the JUUL, but there are cheaper ways (refillable pods, non-pod systems, etc.) to wean yourself off.

You can satisfy your nicotine craving (and eventually dial it down to 0), without inhaling all the other crap that is in cigarettes."
Eat healthy snacks. Drinks lots of water.
"I managed to quit only after I figured out I only started to piss off my parents. I was a long time smoker, but when I had this realization I quit without cravings. I actually have no idea how long it’s been since. "
"I'm pretty sure this is extremely inadvisable, but I got really sick in the winter. When I dragged, it burned all the way down through my lungs. I can't really smoke without thinking about how painful it was. I've dabbled since then, but haven't smoked consistently for 4 years (and haven't touched a cigarette for about 2.5). "
Jail. That got me ro quit lol.
Try vaping with low nicotine content then to the fruity flavours and then quit all together. That’s what I did smoke free for 2 years. GL 
"I had a little mint everytime I wanted a smoke, worked like a charm"
"Juul worked for me. At first I got it as ""why not"" type of purchase but literally next day my desire for a cigarette went away. Haven't smoked in bout 6 months."
"Dont tell anyone youre doing it. Helped me greatly. I just denied the need to go out for a cigarette, told people i was too busy at work and stuff. Bring things to chew on in the car, develop a new habit to do in place of what you did previously. So if you used to wake up, get a cup of cofffee, then go outside for a cigarette first...change that to getting ready while you drink coffee or make a phone call."
You can do vaping if you still like nicotine and what to do a lot less harm to your body. Just make sure you only vape and not half vape/half smoke. 
"First off I chose a date to quit, it was around a month ahead of time,  this was because of some upcoming parties and wanted to enjoy myself. 
By then I had the mindset that I just would never smoke again. This was before vaping, so every time  I wanted a smoke I had a mint instead. When it got really bad I brought some herbal cigarettes from a health shop. They were disgusting but it helped.
When it got really, really, really bad I used nicorette gum, this stuff works by releasing nicotine every time you chew. Don't keep chewing otherwise it'll taste bad.

Then one day I hadn't smoked for a while and I passed somebody in a shop doorway and they had just finished a smoke. They absolutely stank. I could only smell it because I was free of nicotine. That's when I knew I would never smoke again.

Its tough but it is within anyone's grasp, if your thinking of it, do it you'll feel better afterwards and these days smokers are being treated like such arseholes it just isn't worth the bother."
"Just stop!  I quit years ago before Chantix and the other nicotine aids. I have impulse control and bad habits like anybody else - so I suffered cravings, but it just wasn't that bad.

I divide it into 3 phases: 

(1) The first few days when the nicotine withdrawal is the worst, and will make your nerves tingle and your temper short.  During this phase, just do stuff constantly.  Clean your garage, weed the yard, go on a hike...whatever.  Distract yourself. 

(2) The next few weeks.  The constant cravings subside, but you will have cravings at odd times during the day - with your morning coffee, after a meal, when you walk past somebody smoking and it smells so good.  Distract yourself with other thoughts, or do a brief mediation

(3) After a month - you're mostly home free - when you walk past somebody smoking now, it doesn't smell good - it seems disgusting.  Advice here - just don't EVER smoke again.  Don't bum a cigarette at a party, don't buy a pack just to have a few.  Just don't!"
"The patch. It helped so much. I still wanted a cigarette, but i wasnt going to kill anyone if i didnt smoke. Also, my boyfriend really wanted me to stop. Xoxo"
"Sugar free lollipops, Make sure sugar free or end up with 4 missing back teeth like i do lol."
"Toothpicks 

A box of 250 toothpicks is like $1.50 and will significantly help with the oral fixation and hand to mouth. I'm a little cheater and have a Juul, but the toothpicks help me use it less, and I almost never smoke anymore. "
"First I calculated the amount of money I was literally burning for no benefit except increasing my risk of cancer.
Then, I totally upped my hygiene game and reminded myself that the minute I smoked, it would all be undone. Brushed my teeth several times a day. Switched from coffee to tea.
After 24 hours, I convinced myself that the next 24 hours would be easy. Then after 48 hours, I told myself that I had already done 48 do another 48 wouldn't be bad. Etc...
After a month, I relaxed knowing that my body had already begun to heal the damage I had inflicted on it and didn't want to set myself back. Switched back to coffee. Before long, I rarely even thought about cigs."
"The best tip I can provide is before you even begin - pick a date that you're gonna stop smoking. When I quit there was 1 month left until the end of the football season, I knew I loved to have some beers and watch football which would lead me to smoke. 


So I picked the last day after the Superbowl to stop smoking. I was able to, during that month try to be conscious and reduce my smoking where I could. By the time the day came I had timed my last pack, I smoked the last one knowing it would be the last. That was 3 years ago.  "
"Be broke, so you cant afford to smoke"
"Have something to put in your mouth. 

Yes I know you have the urge to make dirty jokes out of that statement, but eating gum helped me a lot."
You can't smoke them if you don't buy them. You don't need to go into a fucking gas station these days so don't. Have some control over yourself and make good decisions.
"Get an overdose. 4 packs in a row did it for me. After some throwing up, never touched a cigarette again. That was 16 years ago. From up to 3 packs to 0 in an evening. 

PS: I guess you might also die trying. But hey, at least you're going down smoking."
"Never a smoker, but as a child of a former smoker, my mom's favorite tip to tell everyone was inhaling through those tiny coffee stirrer straws really helped when she just needed to mimic the action of smoking. She'll be 21 years smoke free next month!"
"I was a smoker from the age of 10 - 3 months ago ( I'm 28) (newports). I tried everything in the book, cold turkey, e cigs , patches. Nothing worked. I finally got one of those juul things and i haven't touched a cigarette in 3 months. Don't even crave it. 

A couple of issues come with that though. It's essentially a replacement and you end up smoking the juul a lot more because you can smoke it wherever. Doesn't leave a smell or anything. So now i'm trying to quit smoking these things. I just ordered the lower nicotine pods off the site so i'm going to try that way.

Switching to juul honestly helped me a lot. I feel better, don't smell like cigs and i'm saving money as well. Try it out"
"First of all, you have to go cold turkey. You can’t taper off or do nicotine substitutes. You’ll just be half-assing it that way and it makes it that much harder to be nicotine free for good.

It’s gonna be scary at first, because you are redefining your life without cigarettes.  The first two weeks are rough, I won’t lie.  You’re gonna feel like an incorrigible child, not getting their candy.  You’re going to be very aware of all of your triggers to smoke.  Once you get past those two weeks, half the battle is won because you got through the physical cravings.  The mental addiction lasts much longer. I’m four years quit and I still sometimes get a mental craving, but it always passes and I’m off to other things.

Be aware that your mind is going to play tricks on you.  Your body and mind are rebelling against you because it is being denied something it’s regularly gotten for a long time.  You’re brain is going to tell you, “C’mon.  Just one smoke isn’t going to matter.  No one has to know.  It will be our secret.”  Do not listen.  Those first weeks and months are slippery, so it’s really important to stick to your guns during this time.

Chewing gum is good for the cravings, but I think cinnamon gum is more effective.  It has some bite to it that helps take your mind off the need to smoke.

Have a support system.  Tell your people that your doing it.  Having people championing you helps keep up your will power.  Let them know the small victories you have each day fighting through the cravings.  The encouragement will really give you a kick in the pants to persevere.

Occupy yourself with something you like to distract you.  It gets you through the day.  Think about why you are quitting and keep it in the forefront of your mind.

Lastly, take it one day at a time.  Every day without giving in to the temptation is a HUGE win for you.  And every day will be easier than the day before.  The farther removed you are from cigarettes the prouder you’ll be.

And smokes aren’t cheap anymore, so think about how much cash you’re going to be saving.  That’s ultimately what got me through.

"
"This is a bit of a CBT technique, but re-frame in your mind what you're doing by quitting. When you quit, what makes it really tough is the massive anxiety you get when you don't get nicotine that you body is craving.  
Essentially, re-frame your thoughts from ""I'm going to tough this out"" to ""This is exposure therapy to help cope with anxiety. And, every anxiety spike I can endure is exercise to resist anxiety from here on out"".   
At least, this is what worked for me. It really helped me resist those urges to go ""fuck it, just one won't hurt this quitting process"". "
"Find a way to break the habits of those times you want to smoke. Like while driving, or relying on it for a break at work. I actually achieved that portion with using Quikmist spray for a while. It broke my habit of needing a cigarette once x happens. It then helped when I actually cut the nicotine out fully, since you have less ""reminders"""
"I smoked for almost 15 years. I tried 7 times before I actually made up my mind to quit for good. Biggest help was those disposable eCigs–I think the brand was Blue. Not sure if they're still around but plenty of vape options. Eventually I just said, ""WTF am I doing sucking on a battery?"" And I gave it up altogether."
"Get cancer, worked for me. Haven’t had a smoke in 10 years come December."
"I used e-cigs.

This is how I've done it without any force of will or negative side effects.

Don't use a vape pen. It doesn't have to be anything fancy so maybe an iJust2 will work (40 USD)

Start with a high nicotine content.

Smoke cigarettes normally, except 3-5 minutes before you smoke, use the vape then smoke.

The last part is really important since you will always have nicotine on your body when you smoke a cigarette. This will trick your brain into disassociating nicotine with cigarettes. After a couple of days when your brain wants nicotine it will not ask you for a cigarette, you will instead crave the e-cig.

4th step: gradually lower the nicotine content of your e- liquid.

5th step: When you get to 3 mg/ml level nicotine, buy a large e-liquid (120 ml) bottle and two 0 mg/ml bottles. Smoke the 3% one and fill it with the 0% one. Keep doing this and it will gradually go from 3% to 0% nicotine without you noticing. When the bottles run out buy another 0% one and keep smokingbjt four a couple of days.

6th step: Stop smoking whenever you want because you're not dependent on nicotine anymore.

7th step: Never ever in your life pick up a cigarette because it will slowly creep on you and make you addicted again.

8th step: if you do get addicted again rinse and repeat."
Mini stroke 4 yrs ago did it for me
"I've quit many times in the last 8~ years. I've tried Zyban, Chantix, patches, gum and going cold turkey. 7.5 weeks ago I decided to quit again using patches. I found an app called Smoke Free. Whenever I'd crave a cigarette I would open the app to see the progress I've made. It tells you how long its been since you last smoked, the money you've saved and health benefits. Highly recommend this app to anyone trying to quit!

Edit- I stopped the patch after 2 weeks."
"Gum, toothpicks, lift weights. "
My wife gave me a blowjob every day I went without smoking.  So...get yourself one of those...
"Not a smoker, but a dipper. Best tip for me was I started identifying as “not a dipper”, so whenever anyone would ask if I wanted a pinch (or cig) I’d just say “sorry I’m not a dipper (smoker)”. "
I was doing work in a hospital and realized that there weren't a lot of old people who were obese or old people outside smoking.  Just threw the pack I had away and stopped cold turkey.  Quitting after the pack is done will never happen.  You just have to want to quit and then quit.
Smoke what?
"The desire to quit.

This might not seem like something to think about, but I have known at least 3 other people who wanted to quit and are still smoking. I wanted to quit and after my dad passed away my mom told me, ""you know your dad wanted you to quit."" That was the final nail to make me go through with something that I needed to do for a while.

4 years later still no cigarettes and I am going to run tomorrow (10/13/2018) a half marathon with a goal of sub 2 hour time. I still believe I made the best decision to quit smoking and the desire to quit is something I tell anyone who asks how I quit. Without that, it's gonna be a whole lot harder to do."
"Collect your last few packs of butts in a jar.  Fill it half full of water after you have finally quit.

When you get a craving, open the jar and have a great big smell of that ashy, tarry bullshit.

It may help."
"Get away from people that do it or any place that has smokers.

&#x200B;"
Go cold turkey. 
"\#1 stop being around people that are having one(easy), or recently had one (not as easy).

\#2 stop talking about it.  The more you bring it up the more you'll want to do it.

\#3 for those that still are, try to hypnotize yourself. I don't mean wave the watch BS. Try this: Just imagine the next cigarette you're going to have taste really awful for some reason - carry this up until you have it. Imagine something horrible tasting - even just like it came out of the gutter or something as you puff. Don't finish it - throw it away in disgust. And convince yourself the next one you have will taste like that. If you get a craving, rinse and repeat.

&#x200B;"
"For me, I just had to get to the point where I was sick of spending money on something that makes me feel like hacking up a lung first thing in the morning.  I was able to finally quit cold turkey after a few failed attempts.  My roommates at the time (friends of mine) were really positive influences as well.  "
"There's no trick to it. Put them away and never touch them again. 
How you do that in your head is your business. Nobody can help with that. "
"Hey OP, something that helped me a lot : https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/30-days-to-success/

Basically it's a challenge with yourself to smoke the least possible for 30 days. I smoked for 10+ years and failed to stop numerous times before trying this method. Something that made me failed is that I had no tolerance to failure at all : if I smoked one cig I started all over again. With this method I kickstarted the habit of not smoking and I've been mostly smoke free for 9 years now. I can smoke from time to time now and not relapse but I almost never feel like it.  
  
Best of luck ! "
"Don’t quit today or tomorrow. Book a date in the future, maybe one that has some meaning (a family members birthday). In the meantime, don’t cut back, just carry on as normal knowing that the day you quit is finally ahead of you. You will start to realise how much you are looking forward to it and whether you really want to quit. If you don’t really want it, there’s not a lot of point trying. "
Nicotine lozenges did it for me. I'm now completely nicotine free.
"Smoked for ten(ish) years. Tried cutting down, tried creating other habits instead. All just made me think about it more. So I just decided to stop.

I know it sounds stupid and I wish I could do the same for my unhealthy eating habits! But I just decided I didn't smoke any more. Now I find it disgusting, I haven't smoked in over a year and whenever I imagine smoking I feel sick remembering that awful taste in my mouth.
"
"I used to smoke a pack a day, back when it was still okay to smoke in restaurants. Never vaped. I tried seriously to quit over 5 times before I finally made my mind up. I did my research, which said your odds of quitting increase to over 50% if you do these three things: get social support set up, use the patch, and use a prescription medication like Zyban (Wellbutrin) or Chantix. 

I talked to a  pharmacist, who told me there are behavioral and a mental sides to addiction. The pills reduced the mental struggle by reducing cravings and anxiety, and the patch removed the physical withdrawal. The withdrawal creates cravings.  He said that the cigarettes, or vaping, give you doses of nicotine, so there is a rush and a withdrawal with every cigarette. The key is to avoid those little withdrawals, by keeping a steady stream of nicotine entering your bloodstream via the patch. This gives your brain a chance to break the behavioral habit side of it before you break the physical dependence side of it.  He said to get the strongest patch and step down. I wore the strongest for a month or two, then stepped down to the medium for a couple months, then the weakest patch for the last two months. 

Two weeks in advance, I got on the prescription, and I started telling everyone I was going to quit on December 29. Be as public as you can. Ask everyone for their support. They’ll be thrilled to help you! 

On quit day, I started by not smoking first thing in the morning and wearing a nicotine patch. I brushed my teeth, chewed gum, and ate baby carrots in the car. I gave up sodas and coffee, too. Carried a water bottle everywhere and drank lots of water. I cleaned the house thoroughly and washed all of the smoke smell out of my clothes. Cleaned the car, too. Threw out all the ashtrays. Stopped taking break outside with smokers. I stopped sitting around, watching television, and instead rode my bike. I hung out with non-smoking friends.

Reward yourself ! Each week, I would take the money I would have spent on cigarettes, and used it to buy myself a treat. Each month I was smoke-free, I rewarded myself again. I experienced occasional cravings, but fewer and fewer as time went by. 

I stayed on Zyban for a year. I stayed on the patches for six months. 

If you really want to quit, stack the deck in your favor. Plan for winning. Make winning as easy as possible and make smoking the hardest, least convenient thing. Make it your first priority. Put as many obstacles between you and a cigarette as you can!"
My parents smoked for 30 years and about 3 years ago switched to just vaping and barely do that now 
"Wellbutrin did it for me. It's after a year or so that you have to be careful. That's when you go ""O I can have 1"" and then you snowball right back to a pack a day in a week. Happened to me after a Vegas trip D: "
I did a p90x routine with a friend and couldn't breathe at all.... I threw the pack in my bag and literally cold turkey quit. Every time I wanted to smoke I took as deep a breathe as I could and tried to appreciate just the aspect of being able to breathe more so than a nasty ass hit of a cig.
Cold turkey. 
"Cravings don't last long and they don't go on forever but it's so hard because they're really intense.  You just have to tell yourself that when they come.  ""This will be over soon, just ride it out"".  I found it really helped."
Reading Allan Carr's book twice (before intending to quit so I didn't actually follow the advice therein and quit at the end - far too daunting!) and then a year or two down the line when the sub-conscious mind had convinced the conscious mind that quitting now was the only option: using Champix (nicotine receptor inhibitor) as it's known in the UK. Thankfully I had no side affects from that and it worked a charm. I don't think I'd have managed cold turkey so I'm forever grateful to the smart boffins who developed the drug. 
"Have a reason to quit. 


Remind yourself of that every time you want to cave.


If you do cave, get over it, it’ll happen at some point. Don’t just think oh thats it I’ve failed now, get your head in the game and think about what lead you to caving and make sure you don’t do it for that reason again.


Been 4 years since I quit, I’ve had 4 cigarettes in that time for various reasons but hey every day is a day better without them. "
"I used lollipops. Not great for your teeth (long-term) but I would use one whenever there was a point in my ""ritual"" times to smoke. In the car on the way to work etc.  After a month or so I didn't need it.  Going on almost 9 years smoke free. Best of luck. "
I'm still getting there. I quit smoking the day I found out I was pregnant and when I lost the baby I started smoking ecigs. Actual cigarettes make me sick now. 
"spend 6 weeks in a hospital bed. I did it! That's the hardest ""easy"" way to quit smoking."
Just switch over to Vaping big fucking clouds like those millenials with fucking big ass holes pierced in their ears and go to burning man.
"Not traditional in the sense of cigarettes - but more-so in the sense of nargile/hookah for me. Used to smoke about 6 hours a day, around 60 grams of tobacco and realized I need to quit after about 8 years of use.

I went the route of cold-turkey, which I failed at miserably twice before it stuck. 

* Recommend removing all instances of your habit from the house, ashtrays, hookahs, lighters, etc - bin it, or give it away. 
* Habits were the toughest thing to break - my body was programmed to come home, eat dinner, and then light up a bowl to watch tv. - so try and build a new habit (whether its working out, video games, etc - force yourself to do it for a few weeks).
* No matter what you do, keep your mind solely focused on how absolutely awful you feel during withdrawals, and realize that is your body detoxifying. Don't give in - I swear once you get past it, youll realize you never want to go through it again (mine took about 3 weeks of headaches, awful sleep, etc)
* Lastly try and build a support unit, all my friends knew I was quitting, my wife knew - everyone would try and keep me away from it finally during my weaker points. 

Good luck, I am now happily at 8 months, and have never felt better :)"
"I did the math on how much it cost to smoke and even though I only smoked 2 packs a week, the extra money helped when I wasnt making ends meet"
"My wife quit cold turkey. She just woke up one day and said ""I don't swing too do that anymore."" and that was that."
"I read the easy way to quit smoking by Allen carr. I didn't quit until about a year after finishing the book. No withdraw or cravings. The book really helps you understand the addiction and why you smoke instead of trying to just address the symptoms of trying to quit.

I was a pack+ a day smoker for about 7 years. The first thing the book tells you is that you should keep smoking while reading it.

Highly recommend to anyone who is a smoker and doesn't want to die a smoker. "
"Like everyone else has said, you have to want to quit first.  My first few attempts at quitting always failed and I would be right back to smoking a pack a day in no time.  I'm honestly not sure what clicked but here are my tips:

* Do it because you really want to.  It's going to be hell so you need to be sure it's what you really want to do.

* Mints, gum, whatever floats your boat but mints helped me immensely.

* My smoking was tied to habits such as eating, driving, and work breaks.  I attempted to find other things to occupy my mind during these times, and also inhaled Altoids like there was no tomorrow.

* Understand that no matter how bad the cravings get, they will go away.  6 years after quitting, I don't even think about cigarettes anymore.  I often forget that I ever smoked in the first place, it's a great feeling.

* Keep track of your progress using an app.  I thought it was neat that the app I was using would track my progress and tell me all the benefits of being quit for X amount of days.  It's been 6 years so I don't know if the app is still good but I used QuitNow on Android.  It also keeps track of your stats of how many cigarettes you've not smoked and how much money you've saved.

* Smoking hurts people around you.  I have a friend who is just not ready to quit smoking and it breaks my heart.  I love the guy to death but he's already overweight, eats poorly, and smokes like a chimney.  I've tried everything I can to get him to quit but he just isn't ready (see first bullet point).  My fear is that if he doesn't curb the habit now while he's still got time to fix his health, it's going to be too late.

* Take some deep breaths.  I was extremely irritable in the weeks that followed quitting.  The smallest things would set me off.  Since cigarettes are what I always turned to when feeling stressed or irritated, I had to learn of new ways to cope.  Deep breathing techniques helped to curb a lot of the irritation and stress plaguing me during that time.

"
"For me, I weaned myself. I was smoking one an hour so the next day, I wouldn’t let myself smoke for an hour and 10 minutes. Next day, an hour and 20 minutes between cigs. Maybe also no smoking in the car. Little things that stretch the time out between cigs without completely depriving me. No exceptions. I did that for about a month and then got the patch. Gum, lollipops, jolly ranchers were helpful with the oral fixation part of it. 

Also, don’t think you can be a social smoker. You can’t. Taking a drag off of a friend’s cig once you’ve stopped is basically your first cig back on the path to being a smoker. 

I quit 15 years ago and it remains one of the hardest things I’ve done. "
"I switched to vaping to wean myself off of cigarettes, then after a year or so of vaping I quit that, too. To help, I bought a flavor that I HATED and it became smoke the shitty flavor or don't smoke at all. I picked the latter. The hardest thing was being around other people while they were smoking, just the smell was enough to make me crave it ravenously. Someone would offer me a cigarette and I would tell myself ""it's just one"" and next thing I knew I was back to my old habits.

It's been about a year since I quit smoking entirely and I have no problem being around other smokers at this point but I still avoid the temptation.

My advice would be to get rid of anything that would tempt you or remind you of the pleasure associated with smoking. I got rid of lighters, ashtrays, and accessories. I stopped going to the smoking area on breaks (even though that's where my friend hangout) and made it a rule that smoking in the car was forbidden! (that was easy after I got my new car because I didn't want it to smell bad and it didn't have an ashtray or built in lighter)

I also stopped drinking which helped a ton, too. Having a cigarette with a beer is one of my favorite things so I gave up alcohol and stopped going to bars all together in order to avoid testing my self control. (or lack thereof)"
Went electric. Some may consider that cheating but it made it super easy 
"Honestly? CBT. 
You don’t need a therapist, you can just google any CBT worksheet available."
I actually just quit three weeks ago. What I did was get an “Addiction Clock” which pretty much counts the time you’ve been “sober”. I used it as a motivational tool. So if I was craving hard I’d look at it to see how long I’d made it which would help me not cave. Also chewing gum is good. And most craving only last about thirty seconds so if you start craving just do something quick to take your mind off it. Also don’t drink to much in the first week or two cause you will mad crave that shit. And after the first week you will find that your cravings have gone down significantly 
"Cold turkey as others said. ""every cigarette you smoke makes you more addicted.""

One of the most important things was a change in how I categorized myself. I became and called myself a non-smoker. It's not that I'm quitting or I quit, it's that I don't smoke. I identify as someone who doesn't enjoy smoking.

Been 7 years haven't looked back."
Just stop I did it I smoked for 20 + years and just stopped 
"Be a parent to yourself. You told yourself to quit, now stop making excuses and do it. You are an adult, you made the decision to smoke as an adult, now act like one if you want to quit. Cravings are rough, but you didn't decide to eat ice cream for every meal, every day for the last how ever many years. Why not? You could have, and it would have been cheaper. You didn't because you didn't give into cravings. If you can stand up to those cravings, you certainly can stand up to these ones. With in two to three weeks, all physical cravings are gone, and it's just between you and your mind. If you can't control your mind to look after your own interests and goals, why bother trying to quit in the first place?"
"Ten years, smoke free for over three."
"Good luck, OP!"
"(on mobile so forgive typos) i quit at the same time that i got out of a toxic friendship. basically their drama would lead to me needing to go on suicide watch at 2 in the morning and other such stress, and that stress made it impossible for me to quit. cigarettes were calming and were somethimg i could seemingly control. when i finally stopped being their friend, i found myself with the perfect opportunity a d quit. 

that was in january and even tho some days i straight bloodhound the air for the sweet scent of nicotine, ive found that quitting was easier bc i wasnt just quitting one bad habit, i was quitting with a whole bad lifestyle.

so maybe thats the trick: quit the stuff that makes you need a smoke, then you just gotta fight your want for one.

oh it does help sometimes when i shout GOD I NEED A CIGARETTE and then immediately say NO I JUST WANT ONE I DONT NEED ONE. sometimes"
"Brush your teeth right after eating if you can, or at least chew mint gum--for me, the after-meal cigarettes were hardest to give up.  You'll want to smoke less if your mouth tastes/feels clean!  I chewed Trident spearmint and it helped."
" Vaping, and now I have a juul which probably isn’t the best idea but I haven’t smoked in awhile."
"keep quitting, no matter how many times you slip. Just keep quitting, eventually the slips get further and further apart until you are able to just quit for good."
"Nicotene gum helped me.  I started out chewing more than the recommended dose.  I was addicted to it, but I didn't care.  Eventually, I transitioned to regular gum, and eventually quit chewing that.  If you're trying to quit, don't stop trying.  Everything is better after you quit."
"Gum. 

if possible, do pushups or some kind of exercise daily.  Working out is awful when you've been smoking so I built a negative relationship with smoking and started getting fit at the same time.  

Cutting down or taking a break from drinking can be good too as that becomes a self feeding cycle, plus your discipline is lowered when you drink.  

When I was out and about I would keep a cigarette behind my ear and see how long I could keep it there before I would smoke. It helped satisfy one aspect of the addiction which was physically having a cigarette and helped to delay the actual smoking.  I eventually worked that into just needing to put a cigarette behind my ear and that was it. Eventually a hobo or someone would ask me for a cigarette and I'd just pass it along. "
"I tried cold turkey about 2 years ago I lasted about 2 weeks...I’ve been using a Smok Infinix over the past month to cut out cigarettes, and I’ve also lowered my Nicotine amount. Not only has it saved me a ton of money since the pods are refillable, I haven’t craved a cigarette since!! "
Just stop and be happy u no longer smoke.
Don't smoke at work. It's easy to get in the rhythm after that and stop thinking about it.
"Well I've managed to quit smoking after 7 years and what really helped me was constantly vaping. Not the greatest alternative, but after about a month of 3mg nicotine juice I switched to 0 and haven't smoked since. For me, part of it is that the vape juice is so sweet/good tasting and then when you hit a cig it tastes like ass. Unfortunately I had to vape all the damn time to beat the urge. Now I can go all day without it at all cause I'm not physically addicted. 
I will say the hardest part for me was the shitty justification I'd make in my head. ""oh, I've had a bad day I can just go grab a pack then give the rest to x friend that smokes. "" Never worked. Then I started bumming instead of buying and giving friends cash to make up for it. Same damn thing. Good luck!"

"This is going to sound dumb, but seriously just do it cold turkey. Find a friend or family member that will stay with you the first few days try to take a few days off of work to deal with the withdrawals and wait it out.  

You'll feel like absolute shit the first three days, pretty bad for a week, and feel great after a month. "
"I went the Nicorette route.  Quitting cold turkey wasn't feasible.  Nicorette took care of the cravings until I got over the chemical addiction, then just weaned off of the lozenges until I didn't need them.  Worked pretty well.  Going on 16 years tobacco free and being around cigarette smoke doesn't bother me."
"If you want to go the medical route, Wellbutrin stopped my smoking habit. Granted, I took it for depression - but not wanting to smoke was a pleasant outcome."
"You have to really want to do it. I did not use any methods to help you with, unfortunately.. Half-way through a cigarette, I decided I was done. Gave the rest of my pack away. That was that. It has been almost 10 years."
"I did the 10 session program from ""hypnosisdownloads"" dot com and would highly recommend it to any English speaker who wants to quit.   

I didn't feel any significant urge to smoke until about a week after I finished listening to the program.  But by then it was too late.  I was not going to get suckered into wasting more money."
"Smoked for 17 years. Pack or more a day. Decided it was time. You have to be ready, because quitting sucks, but is sooooo worth it. 
I did the patch for 6 months total. I spent the extra money on getting the name brand Nicoderm, not the generic. I started at the highest dose, and went down about every 8-10 weeks til I felt ok being without completely. Haven't has so much as a puff since March 2014. Still like the smell, but don't miss it. "
"Quit as many times as you need to, but understand when you're serious about it you must commit to never having another puff on a cigarette ever again.  This is the only thing that will work.

Similarly, you will have to embrace the cold turkey mentality but not necessarily the method.  What do I mean by this?  You will have to come to a point where you will not assuage cravings with an NRT.  You will just have to grit your teeth through withdrawals and starve your body of nicotine until it gives up asking for it.

People who allow themselves to believe that NRTs are going to make quitting painless set themselves up for failure.  After your last patch/lozenge etc., you just have to grind it out; if you continue to substitute - even with substantially lower doses of nicotine - you are going to end up addicted to NRTs or relapse....or both.  Trust me.

So use NRTs as a way to make that final battle less violent and exacting.  Go through the physical purging (hacking up crap, having flu like symptoms) while on the NRTs...sure.  Get yourself to a point where your body is looking for 1-7 mg of nicotine daily as opposed to 21+...sure.  Just know that no matter how much you wean yourself off, that last stage where you say 'no more' will be difficult and there is no resolution but to bear with.

Good luck.

"Set rules for yourself and follow them.  Mine were no smoking in the house, no smoke breaks at work.  Went from a pack a day to a pack every 3 to 4 days.  Then I bought a vape so I could sit on the couch and smoke when it was too cold to go outside.  I just never bought another pack of smokes.  I never really tried to quit, it just happened on it's own."
Actually decide you are a non smoker. Until I thought of myself as ex smoker instead of a smoker trying to quit it never worked. That and even a stupid cheap vape pen just to give you the oral fix.
I used a vape with no nicotine for about 2 months. After the hardest part you just have to... not do it I guess. Realize that many habits trigger your desire to smoke. Pay attention and do something to distract yourself in the moment of a craving. You just need 10 minutes. And if that doesn’t work then remove yourself from the situation that triggers your desire if you can.

"I wouldn't recommend it because it's not necessarily healthy but this is how I approached it.

The thing about smoking is you're dealing with several different habits at once. The nicotine addiction, the sedentary lifestyle from being a smoker (usually), the smoke at key moments of the day like after a meal or waking up, the ritual of taking a drag, the oral fixation...it's all psychologically chiseled into your head and it's REALLY tough to beat them all at once.

So my plan was to tackle things one at a time. For me, the ritual of holding the smoke between my fingers and taking a drag were pretty strong, so I switched to snus.  This gave my lungs much needed rest.  Snus is also a little safer than cigarettes so pretty much a net gain overall. I got to the point where cigarettes kinda disgusted me from the smoke smell and lost all desire to smoke just dip. 

From there I switched to the patch. I intentionally stayed on the patch twice as long at each step to make sure I eased off the nicotine dependence. I made a point to eat whatever I wanted, I knew I was going to gain weight. I'd rather be 20 pounds heavier and smoke free than the same weight and go back to tobacco.

After the patches I had gained some weight, about 20 pounds. Then I dieted and about a year later back to my old weight and now I'm tobacco free.  Took a lot longer but I'm confident I'm done with tobacco. pot is legal in my state and I don't even really like smoking it, I stick to edibles when I do it.

so basically I guess what I did was traded smoking for progressively ""better"" habits until I was habit free."
You have to really want to quit. Can't quit for anyone else.

"smoked a pack a day for 10 years to the day July 22nd 2003 - July 22 2013. I literally decided to stop going to the convenience store and never really thought about it again. There was a small transition period where I stopped taking 10 minute breaks throughout the workday that took some getting used to. I wasn't upset, stressed, financially strapped or in failing health, I just stopped smoking and seems like it was no big deal to quit."
"Set a date, tell everyone you’re quitting.  As you approach the date, with every inhale, think about all the shit that’s going in, condition yourself to hate it.  When the date arrives, stop.  Make the decision that no matter what you’re not going to light up, carry some nicotine gum with you but have some ONLY when it’s that or light up."
"If you’re also depressed, welbutrin can kill two birds with one stone. It can kill the cravings if you’re wanting to quit. 

Also: not letting a cheat cigarette halt your progress. Like: you’ve gone two weeks without a cigarette but you go out with the boys for beers and you cave and have one. That doesn’t mean you’ve stopped quitting, it just means you had a cheater. That’s ok as long as you keep going with the quitting. "

Before I knew it, anytime I was going outside, or leaving to go somewhere, cigarette. 
It finally hit me one day when something so minimal happened, and my immediate thought was ""Ugh, I need a cig"" thinking how aggravated I was. It honestly felt sad, like...the first time I'm facing any 'real' adversity in life, and I'm already having to find outlets and creating vices for myself.

I'm more nervous and less personable because I am constantly just thinking about one thing, that ruminating thought. Then, the thought never goes away. You just get better and better at handling your emotions and stress levels until it seems to fade away.

Also, never. Never ever ever never ever even for a second think that ""just one"" is going to be ok. It is an immediate spiral back into the problem. 

Also also, if you fail and fall back in just try again. You will always be a smoker that just hasn't had one in a while, so don't get all beat up and give up if you start again. Do whatever it takes to stop if you do.

Try reading The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. I smoked for 12 years but I've been free and clear for 6 years and that really helped me.
"Both my parents use to smoke.
My Dad smoked for seven years, and he trained himself to associate cigarettes with chest pain and shortness of breath rather than ""looking or feeling good.""
My Mum smoked for 15 years, and decided to quit because she needed the money long term. She ate a mini chocolate bar every time she had a craving instead of a cigarrete. She gained a bit of weight, but if you can quit smoking, you can shed a couple of pounds.
As for me, I swapped to a vape a couple of weeks ago and have around 4 cigarettes since then. It saves me money, and I don't stink all the time, but the truth is I don't want to quit yet, probably because I'm still dealing with the shit that lead me to start in the first place."
"Allan Carr, but read it thouroghly and not to fast.  And.. just do it."
"reposted from something i replied to a while back:

Angry ex smoker here, smoked for 20 years, quit for 10 so far.

Get angry at yourself. Put a nicotine patch on and step the nicotine down slowly. Use them for as long as you need to but don't smoke while you have a patch on. I would recommend that you take the patch off at night if you start to have the really vivid dreams they cause. If you are the type of smoker that lights up as soon as they wake up you might want to leave them on 24/7 for a while and just deal with the dreams. (they can get quite intense) I found that Patches worked way better than Chantix which will make you want to kill yourself (its really an anti-depressant, close to Wellbutrin). Don't take drugs that mess with your brain chemistry if you dont HAVE to. You can do this without it, REPLACE the nicotine with patches, and slowly step the dose down. Its science. Breaking an addiction starts with stepping down your doses so you're not going cold turkey and shocking your system. as far as your body knows, its getting what it wants, just not the deadly carcinogens and other nasty stuff that comes with cigarette smoke.

I don't know if its true, but convince yourself that you will die if you smoke with the patch on.

Now for the fun part: Start to notice the smell other smokers. They really stink. As you develop taste and smell again, cigarette smoke will smell FOUL. Convince yourself you never wanna smell like that. Know that you DID smell that way and its unacceptable. Be embarrassed that other people smelled you like that and it was offensive. Notice how stupid people look sucking on those stupid things, freezing their asses off in doorways and outdoor smoking areas. Notice how smokers' car interiors smell and how gross it is. Houses too. Know that YOUR house and car smell that way too. It takes a long time for it to go away too. I wound up selling my car because it reeked, and buying a new one with the money i saved on cigarettes. ($7x2 per day $14x30 days in a month, = $420. that's a NICE car payment!)

Get pissed at them when they crowd the doorways making you run the gauntlet of foul smelling air as you walk into whatever building you're going into.

Kissing a gorgeous person that smokes is like licking a very nice looking ashtray. Its still disgusting. Pity them as weak assholes who cant control the simplest things in their life. You're way stronger than them. good luck. dont smoke. Refuse to be a slave to it.

The KEY to your success is convincing yourself that you don't smoke any more. Whenever you get a crave, (and they WILL come, and sometimes its like getting hit with a bat, ride them out. I chewed gum to get the menthol blast i was looking for. My jaw got so strong i could bite through steel cable.) Tell yourself ""Wait, I dont smoke any more"". let it become your mantra.

At 3 months the cravings will be less and less, then out of NOWHERE you will get hit with them again. Don't let it beat you. At 6 months it happens again, be aware of your brain trying to fool you into justifying 'just one' to see if you're REALLY quit. DON'T SMOKE! Don't give into it. This is normal to be happening, and you should stay the course of not smoking.

Use all that you have learned in the past to get you thru the craves. Dont be a weakling. If you need a break that bad, don't go out and smoke, go to the bathroom instead and just sit in a stall and browse reddit on your phone for 10-15 mins. Whatever it takes. I was able to stand out there in the smoking section with my friends and just not smoke. I don't expect everyone to have that kind of willpower.

TL;Dr: Grow a pair, Put a patch on, get angry with yourself, pity other smokers, refuse to be that stinky person, save money.

edit: some words"
chewing gum and knowing for a fact that after a week the chemical dependency will be gone. then it's just keeping honest with yourself and not buying a pack
Never buy any. Never ask for some.
"Buy your final pack and leave it unopened. It becomes the physical thing you are saying no to and once the cravings ease, every time you see that unopened pack you feel proud."
"Having a relative die horribly of lung cancer inspired me to quit smoking cold turkey. About a week before she died, I stopped smoking, haven't touched a cigarette since. Smoked for about a decade and have been free of it for... Wow almost 5 years now!

My biggest advice is to be realistic with yourself. Really, is it worth sneaking in a cigarette when you're doing so well? What about all the multitude of reasons you already have for quitting?

Exercise your willpower, you're gonna make it through, just stay firm and divert yourself with other things. I'm not saying it wasn't hard cause DAMN it was. But I did it and I've got such low willpower that I always impulse buy the candy at the grocery store or the cookies or whatever. If I can do it, so can you!"
I kind of quit cold turkey and then got the urges later on. I just used sunflower seeds and ate food. Kind of an unhealthy habit but I guess it's better than smoking. 
"This is gonna sound weird but I used to drag air through my two fingers whenever I would drive. It was an oral fixation in the car and on the way to work. Stressful situations and whenever I ate, I would do the same. 

"
Stop trying to fit in
"I was obsessed with quitting smoking and it made it difficult because I could think of nothing else until I gave in and smoked a cigarette to clear my mind. The only thing that helped was to distract myself every time I would start to obsess about my cravings, like going for a walk or doing a quick chore around the house. It took a few times but finally quit. 
Also, sneaking around to hide your smoking from your spouse feels like crap so some motivation from that as well.  "
"Keep trying.  No matter what.  Every day you do not smoke is a victory.  Do not let slip ups get you down.  It took me years of trying after 17 years of smoking, but I have been quit about 8 or 9 years and it is wonderful."
"I got a prescription for Chantix but I wasn’t optimistic that it would work.  I was a two pack plus a day smoker.  Loved smoking. Loved it. Three days in to the week that you take the pill and continue to smoke, my mother died of lung cancer. She had also been a heavy smoker.  All of the anxiety and unhappiness I felt from not smoking was engulfed by my grief. I continued with the Chantix through it all, and haven’t smoked in over ten years.

I would not recommend this method."
"You have to drive/walk to a store to buy cigarettes. Stop doing that. We are creatures of habit, stop going to the counter and giving your money for a product that kills you. "
"Everyone works differently, but this is what worked for me (currently 2 and a half years quit).   


First, I switched to vaping. Took about two weeks to really get into it (it IS different, you just have to get used to it - but you're still getting your nicotine). Then I slowly decreased the amount of nicotine in my juice over a period of many months (becoming accustomed to each level before dropping again).  


I managed to get it from 24mg of nicotine, down to 0.5mg. Then I just quit cold turkey after that. And you know what- the next two weeks were STILL hard. But not *nearly* as difficult as going cold turkey from a half a pack a day habit of cigarettes, I can tell you that."
i went and got hypnotized. best 150 i ever spent. 
"Don’t even up just vaping or using patches or gum for there on, i took some pills which took away the effect of nicotine, later it turned out they were not really safe though so I think they was taken off the market. But i did stop and it was in 2010, smoked a joint 2 or 4 times since though maybe"
"Step 1: Truly want to quit because YOU want to quit.  
Step 2: Quit cold turkey.     

This works. "
Chantix. I smoked a pack and a half a day for 17 years and drank all the time. Chantix is a miracle drug. It made quitting easier than turning off a Sacramento Kings game. 
"Honestly cold Turkey, I quit that way bc I found out I was pregnant. It sucks at first and my motivation was growing a human. But after she was born at like a year old I started again bc I was around smokers. Was told I had precancerous cells growing, and needed surgery in a month to remove it. It was successful. But your health is seriously at risk smoking. Do it for you. To be able to breathe,taste, and smell better both with your nose and your clothing."
"What worked for me was a pill, a drug that my doctor prescribed that I took for about 6 weeks (should have been 12) that made me not wanna smoke. The first few weeks were the hardest with changing habits and all, but I survived.

The reason I'm not stating the name of the drug is because I found out later (and I hate the doctor for not telling me beforehand) that the drug has side-effects. One of its side effects is depression/suicidal thoughts.

Now, I don't suffer from depression, but for almost 6 months after stopping to take that drug I had stupid thoughts, mood swings and shit. All in all, that shit is scary and I would not recommend it to anyone. My doctor recommended it to me because she most definitely got a kickback from the company. My insurance didnt even wanna pay for it. Fucked up drug, but it did make me/cause me to quit as I don't know if would have been able to otherwise."
"Studies have shown aids are ineffective, it's just about having a good enough reason to quit.  If you want to quit because ""eh, its not great for you I guess"" that probably isn't going to cut it if you're addicted.  I smoked 10 years then fell in love with a women who hated it.  I quit coldturkey and it was much easier than my earlier attempts at quitting using aids/tricks/sunflower seeds/etc."
"It gets a lot of hate but I was a pack-a-day smoker before my vape. Now it's been almost a year since my last cigarette. There was definitely some overlap, but now I'm down to the lowest nicotine strength (besides 0) and feel a lot better. The whole 'it saves you money' only applies to the little cheap ones, not the big box mods, which, while much more annoying to others if you're not attentive when using it, are also much more satisfying."
"I used a vaporizer, then gradually cut back on the nicotine concentrations. I then one day just threw away the vaporizer(it being expensive) I said wasn't going to spend the money on another one. I was ornery and irritable for a week or so, but that all subsided and went away. I am thankful everyday that I quit."
Dont buy sigarets.
"Zyban was helpful. It won't do it for you, but seemed to cut down on cravings without any noticeable side effects. It made my final quit much more bearable. That was a while back, sounds like newer drugs are even more effective.

Still went through the usual routine and needed to want it - I was sick of smoking, getting nothing out of it but scratching that itch. I've now been quit longer than I ever smoked.

The other thing I realized was that I couldn't cheat. At all. I have not had a single cigarette and do not intend to, ever. I know that even after all this time I could buy a single pack and be right back where I was by the end of it.

The scariest part of the whole thing was the idea of *never smoking again* and the feeling that I was committing to a lifetime of battling cravings. I can tell you this is not the case. By the end of the first year I realized I had already gone sometimes days without thinking about smoking. In the 2-3 years after I sometimes went months without even considering it. And even when I did think about it, it was very vague, weak, easily dismissed. After 5 years I had really no cravings at all - occasionally I'll smell it and feel nostalgic but that's about it.

The only long term effect is the occasional anxiety dream - you know the one where you have a test but forgot to go to class all year? I have dreams where I'm smoking and then realize that I've forgotten that I quit. I think ""dammit, now I have to go through quitting all over again!"" Not that often, maybe once or twice a year. I also think that's general anxiety (i.e. having that one *instead* of the school dream)."

"Hi, I’m late, but I wanted to share my story. 

I read something on Reddit once, this guy said he would start by taking it one day at a time. Focus on not smoking today. Then when tomorrow comes, do the same thing. All this time, he doesn’t tell anyone... until two weeks have passed. By then, when he tells his family and friends, they’re so happy for him. This encourages him to continue to not pick up another cigarette. 

I tried it out. First day, I ran out of cigs, but I hide myself at home, binge watching the first season of Stranger Things. I ordered food to be delivered and I never left my couch. Didn’t matter, my goal was just not to smoke that day. The next day, I did the same thing. By the third day, my partner came home from being away, and I told him I had not smoked for 48 hours and he was proud of me. 

When I went out and friends offered me smokes, I would decline but join them (crazy, I know, but I wanted to breathe it in). 

Three weeks later, I flew back to my country and broke the news to everyone. That Redditor was right. Their encouragement made me not want to disappoint them. Also I’ve come this far! Three weeks! I can do another three. That’s what I focus on. Short time frames. 

Next thing you know, a year has passed — and you haven’t had a smoke! 

I’ve been smoke free for two years in August. Oh yeah, I quit a day after my birthday, so I remember that day very well. 

Good luck to you, I hope all goes well! I hope few years down the road, you’ll be sharing your story to another Redditor. 

Edit: I want to add that I would transfer money that I would spend on cigs into another account that I never touch. Watching it grow made me feel so proud that I was able to save at the same time. "
"Best results I had was to do it on a trip. Getting away from my usual places made it easier to not keep hitting my triggers to want to smoke.

The other time I quit was when I was in the hospital for a week. Just didn't ask for a nic patch and was done by the time I was out."
Snus.
"Avoid situations that trigger you. Like...if you smoke after eating a pizza, stop eating pizza for some time. I always wanted to smoke while sitting at my desk....so I moved my PC to my bed and used my TV as a desktop. It really helped. Eating tangerines every time I wanted a cigarete helped me a lot. I ate maybe 1kg in two days for weeks ;)

Also a time were you are not stressed is good."
"Smoke free 12 years this month.  Heart attack, triple bypass, induced coma for 1 &1/2 weeks.  Woke up and never wanted a cigarette again.  

Don't do it like me.  Quit before it's too late."
"Cut back little by little. Once you’re down to a few a day, cold turkey. "
I told everyone I was quitting. I am way too proud to accept public defeat !
Yall need to stop talking smack about cold turkeys. Thanksgiving is coming up. 
"PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE Read the book titled ""Easy way to quit smoking by: Allen Carr.

Lots of people have used this book to quit including Ellen Degenerous, and Ashton Kutcher.
It's a shame not more people know about this book cause it's the one thing that worked and stuck.

Smoke free for 4 months :)"
I quit cold turkey on a drive to visit family when I realized I'd pulled into a rest stop if driven past hundreds of times before just because I wanted a smoke. Realizing I'd altered my habits just for the sake of smoking turned out to be a big turn off to the whole idea. Getting away from the crowd of 'friends' who's originally encouraged me to start smoking helped as well. 
"I woke up in the morning. Stopped smoking, stopped drinking alcohol and started to be a vegan. Drank my first beer 2 months later, quit being a vegan 9 months later. But I never again smoked a cigarette. I don't know why this worked but it did."
Take acid. 
"Planned for a whole year in advance to quit smoking.  Was my Sr. year in college and had gradually increased my intake to nearly a pack a day.  After waking up a few morning gasping for air, decided it was time for a change, but also realized it would be impossible to quit with the stresses and joys of school.  So set a date sometime after that summer to mentally prepare.  And thoroughly ENJOYED smoking for that final year, knowing it would be my last.  "
"1. When you decide you want to quit, get all your cigarettes, ashtrays, lighters (save one for candles if you have to), etc. and throw them all in the trash. Outside your house, preferably right before it's going to be picked up. Just get rid of all of it. Then, if you have energy, vacuum and dust your house and spray air freshener so you don't smell that delicious smokey smell anymore. 
2. Pick up a new ""hands"" hobby. I taught myself to crochet while I watched tv. Something that not only engages your hands but also requires at least some concentration will help you pass time without thinking about needing a smoke. 
3. Use a stop smoking aid if you have to. I used the step-down patches and followed the dosages and times exactly. By the time I was on the last week of the last step I felt fine without them. 

Those are my top three tips. I've been smoke free for seven years this past August. One thing I did that didn't help: Binge-watched Lost. I figured a deserted island wouldn't show anyone smoking. Wrong. (Although this did help me throw out that one last ""emergency"" pack I hid in my desk drawer when I realized I was hoarding cigarettes like Charlie was hoarding cocaine in a tree.) Good luck!"
"Definitely something to fill that oral fixation void. Lollipops, jolly ranchers, gum. 

I kept taking breaks from smoking until I got knocked up. So I’m not the most helpful. "
"Have a heart attack at 35... then be told that the next puff could be your last. At 3 am in the morning 2 days before Christmas.

Haven touched a smoke in 22 years..."
Exercise. I quit cold turkey and took up bike riding. 
You actually have to quit. You can’t just keep cutting back. 
"Don't consider it a failure if you smoke one.  I would have one and think ""oh I fucked it up"" then have a whole pack."
"Start vaping, quoting vape is way easier "
"Haven't smoked since the 23rd of last month. I've smoked for 12 years and it took a throat inflammation to get me to hate cigarettes. 

I decided then that I wouldnt smoke anymore. The pain was not worth it. When I got better, I still hated it as much and reminded myself that it could be a lot worse. 

Kinda worked I guess since I dont crave cigarettes anymore, even when in the compamy of those that smoke. Its all in the mind I suppose, you have to really want to quit, really hate it and feel no joy in it.

Occasionally, I'll smoke weed with some tobacco, but thats about it."
You can wait for the sickening shooting pain radiating down the left arm from a smoking compromised artery. That did it. Cold turkeyed without a problem 27 years ago after a 25 year habit. 
"Vaping.  Ticks all the ""habitual actions"" boxes (except there are different actions required, like keeping batteries charged instead of having a lighter/s + fuel).  There is a reasonable simulacrum of smoke and the feeling is much the same.

The big difference is that you're just warming stuff up in a vaper; not setting light to it.  Burning is - by definition - oxidising and that makes different chemicals.  Lots of them; many of which do not do you any favours."
"Read Allan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. Helped my boyfriend and his best friend quit. It has a different perspective and seems unbelievable at first, but it really works"
"Pick a quit date months ahead of time. Not on a holiday or stressful time (my wife kept trying to quit the week before her parents would visit). Gear up for that date. Make it a big event (personally). Have nicotene patches ready. Plus, you have to replace the actual activity of smoking with something else. Especially at those times where you always smoke, like after eating."
"I used Nicorette initially, still getting nicotine but it helps you break the habit of actually smoking. Then I would start doing half a piece with half a piece of regular gum, and eventually just regular gum with no nicorette. I was only ever to fully quit smoking when I quit drinking. Another thing that helped was learning to distract myself with something when a craving hit. They tend to go away after about 5 minutes or so. "
Cardio. Desire to quit. Cardio. 
"Don't thnk ""I quit smoking"", say ""I don't smoke""."
Stop putting cigarettes in your mouth and lighting them.
"Go cold turkey, join an online support group that requires you to check in each day, and exercise.  Lots and lots of exercise.  Eat a ton of food/sweets if you have to and lose the weight after the cravings subside.

Edit:  I'm now going on four years clean and prior to cold turkey I tried Chantix, gum, and weaning but none of it worked.  Only cold turkey and a support group did it for me."
Knowing deep down you want a health lifestyle change for your future. You will only quit when you want to quit.
Take 300ug of LSD and smoke a cig at the peak. The taste of cancer and chemicals will put you off for a good couple months.
"Others have mentioned vaping. That's definitely the 100% easiest way to quit smoking. I switched practically overnight and have been off cigarettes for 3 or 4 years now. I've also seen tons of people who were lifelong smokers switch over to vapes and not go back. 

&#x200B;

Alternatively, I found the patch worked really really well and I was off cigarettes for about a year and a half after using them. As an additional bonus, the patch gives you \_absolutely bonkers\_ dreams."
"I smoked for 7-8 years, quit 18 months ago. 

If you truly *want* to quit, it’s quite doable. Give yourself true blue reasons to quit. You must believe in these reasons. These reasons must be important to you. Then decide on the date, smoke up the rest of your pack, and just stop. 

For me, all I needed to throw into the mix was some exercise. I went for long walks every day. My only difficulty was some irritability on day 3 and a nasty headache on day 4.

My dad quit smoking 20~ years ago, he substituted lollipops for cigs. Might help with the oral fixation thing. "
"Remind yourself you're killing your self every drag you take. Look yourself in the mirror and admit you're probably already at risk of dying of cancer. Don't smoke low nicotine cigs because saying they're ""less addictive"" isn't helping. Don't try to wing yourself off with them. They cause a lung cancer that is more difficult to cure, and they're only low nicotine because there are pin holes near the filter that let air in.  Smell your hands after you smoke, that's how your whole body smells. Stop doing stuff that covers up smoking. Stop whitening ur teeth. Stop using scents to cover it up. Let society effect your life choices. Under this circumstance it's for the better. "
"Not an ad, but JUUL was a game changer for me. I started by just smoking it while at home. Then I cut out smokes while driving. Now I dont smoke real cigs at all. I know these vapes are safe either, but from a pack a day smoker for the last 6 years to none, its been great. Havent had a real cig in about 3 months now. I say Juul only because it was the closest thing to a real cig for me. "
"Don't be too proud to use other nicotine products (patches, gum etc) to help you quit. That's how I did it and it's been over 12 years now. "
"Actually want to quit. Just do it. Sunflower seeds, determination and an unwavering I can do it attitude. Knowing it will only benefit you in the long run."
"I went whole hog on quitting smoking. 
Nicotine patch (stronger than needed , cut in half to save money). 
Gum. 
Vape. 

Pretty much off the patch. Gum's for major cravings, vape just keeps the edge off. 

"
"Quit drinking. For me they went hand in hand. Unlike many smokers I ouldnt stomach more then half a cig without a couple shots in me first. However, once I was on a roll I chain smoked all night. I gave up drinking when my wife got pregnant. It wasn't easy, I did outpatient rehab, twice. I decided to listen to advice and quit smoking at the same time. It was the best decision I ever made. I still get cravings for both, especially while out at night or watching old movies but it's getting easier. I buy better quality food and toys for my kid with the money I save. I'd imagine I'll partake in whiskey and the occasional cigar again when I'm retired but cigarettes are donezo.
Tl:DR if your quitting smoking or drinking quit the other too simultaneously. "
"Noticing a lot of people don't seem down with it, but I suggest vaping. Haven't had a cigarette in over two years, going on strong. I suggest DOING YOUR OWN RESEARCH into it if you are skeptical. 

For the naysayers, no matter how you feel about vaping, you can't deny that switching from inhaling burning vegetation with thousands of added chemicals... To an alternative that is comprised of roughly FIVE chemicals (PG, VG, nicotine, and flavoring) is better. 

I've gained all the benefits of quitting cigarettes, and can still enjoy it. It's also much MUCH cheaper."
"Realize that you actually can't afford to smoke. Between the cost of the cigarettes and the deterioration of your physical health, you cannot afford to smoke, no matter who you are. I quit when I realized how much I was spending a month. Every week I went out to buy a carton of smokes for $60, no matter what else I actually needed or if I could really even afford it. My SO and I quit cold turkey on October 31st, 2016, after addressing our goals for the future and realizing we were not going anywhere if we couldn't save money. We look back now with wiser eyes and regret many other aspects of our addiciton, such as littering cigarette butts on the sidewalk and exposing others to second-hand smoke, but the money was always the main motivator. "
"Smoking is about the addiction to control. Sure the nicatine is the draw and the physical addiction but smoking is less about physical and more mental. 

For me it was meeting my now wife. She didn't like the smell and I liked her more. So I stopped. I wanted to make  her my wife from our 1st date, we picked out our kids names on our second date.


That was 17 years ago. The crazy thing is, there isn't a day  that goes by that I dont want a smoke at some point in the day. Its usually moments that I want to feel control, because that's smoking. It's the repeated sensation of wanting something as much as anything you can imagine and getting it. Each and every time... that's power!

But for me, being with the woman of my dreams and treating her like shes my universe is a more rewarding activity. "
"The biggest thing is truly wanting to quit.  Doing it for someone or something else will probably end if failure, because any break down can quickly lead to sliding right back into it.

As a heavy smoker I tried to quit unsuccessfully several times.  The only time I was successful was when I decided I was done.  I quit cold turkey in 2003."
"I get the A H1-N1 flu. When you get this kind of virus you have to get a Chest X-ray because the Doctors have to see if you have pneumonia or something like that. Three different Doctors asked me if i smoke a lot because it was clearly that I did by just looking at the chest Xray. I went cold turkey after that shit. I spent 10 years smoking at least one package daily and never wanted to quit. My advice is that you really must have the will to it, If you make excuses that the traditional methods don't work Is because you don't really want to quit and you just want magic or a miracle. BTW I always dream that I smoke and I still love/miss smoking but I don't want to smoke never again. "
I started vaping instead. I’ve been able to reduce my nicotine intake from a pack of cigarettes a day to a couple of puffs of the vape a day. Does that count?
"I smoked for six or seven years and came to the realization I don't actually enjoy smoking anymore due to the side effects it was causing, so I threw away the rest of my pack and never bought another.  If you don't buy them or ask for them, you can quit without anything besides willpower. "
Drop acid and think about the reasons you smoke and the reasons you don't want to smoke
"For me, cold turkey (plus chewing gum) was the only way to go. “Slowing down” never helped. 

My parents both went with Nicorette, and still chew it to this day, years after quitting. Still better than smoking!

Twice in my life since quitting, I took up occasional social smoking, and both times, it started getting out of hand, so I’m done with that idiocy now. 

Good luck, and keep trying. A relapse isn’t an excuse to keep smoking for another month or year, it’s an opportunity to try again right now. "
Psilocybe mushrooms. Look it up :) 
Get pregnant. Quit cold turkey the day I saw that positive.
"I quit after 10 years of heavy smoking by purchasing a new car with a leather interior that I wanted to keep in good condition (cigarettes in the car was one of my favorite things to do) and also keeping in mind that I wanted to try to get pregnant that year. Those two things were enough motivation to quit cold turkey, which is honestly the only way to do it, IMO. It's kinda like ripping a band-aid off. It sucks. It's uncomfortable and it's the only thing you'll think of for a few days, but it will eventually get easier.  You know the alternative and it will never get easier, but you can totally do it.

2.5 years smoke free, with an 18m old daughter ❤️"
When you finish your last pack just don’t go into the convenience store to buy another pack.   That’s what i did....but i was also super ready to quit. So that helped with going cold turkey. Now smoking cigarettes makes me sick
"Switched to REALLY cheap, awful cigarettes, by half way through the second carton I couldn't finish them anymore. By the end if it I didnt even want to look at at them."
"I’m on day 12, and it’s probably my 4th time quitting. ACTUALLY PUT THE MONEY INTO A SAVINGS WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT GROW, watching my savings grow is so much more pleasureable than that headrush. I can pay my rent with the money I’m saving ( I’m renting a room)."
"Find something else to do with your hands. I know it sounds stupid, but it really worked for me. "
"Download the Smoke Free app. It shows you all the accumulating rewards of not smoking in real time. I’d never quit over a couple of days previously.

Got up to 5 months using that. I started by having open ALL the time. Then only opened it when I had a craving. Then started opening it just out of curiosity. Saved enough to buy myself a PS4 in a short space of time, which I’d wanted for a very long time.

That app is brilliant."
"Two things prepared me mentally for quitting smoking. Ultimately, successfully quitting smoking is about re-wiring how your brain thinks.

One, I heard similar stories from two people that I know, that don’t know each other. They both said that they quit over 20 years prior, but still would occasionally get cravings. That made me realize that quitting smoking isn’t easy, it is a lifelong battle.

Two, another friend shared how he quit smoking. Every time he lit up a cigarette, regardless of whether he was alone or in a crowd of a thousand people, he would say, out loud, “I am a non-smoker, I do not smoke.” as he was lighting up the cigarette. At first you feel silly, and it just doesn’t sit right, because basically you’re lying to yourself. Eventually, though, it becomes a mantra that you say to yourself to get through the next hour, or 15 minutes, or even the next minute, until the craving passes. And it inevitably does.

I didn’t do it quite every time I lit up, like my friend, but the self imposed Jedi mind trick eventually worked on me too. Sixteen years and counting for me. Every day that goes by adds to the streak, and there better be a goddamn good reason for me to break that streak now. Bottom line, there isn’t one. Can confirm, though, that every once in a blue moon, a craving will still hit me, but they happen less and less frequently the longer you go without, and they get milder and easier to deal with over time. The other guys I mentioned in this reply, by the way, are going on 40, 40 and 30 years smoke free now.

I wish the OP and whoever reading this that’s contemplating quitting the best of success in accomplishing that goal. If I can do it, you can too!

"
"Change of mind-set. Don’t imply your “ giving something up”  or  “quitting”, you start off on the wrong foot by creating a dependency. Instead when you stop that’s that, you stopped an focus instead on the positives of being a non smoker.  It’s worth it. "
"When you quit smoking, also quit drinking for six months.  Then when you start drinking again, start very slowly.  

"
"I used Chantix. I did get the vivid dreams that they warn you about, but it wasn't anything scary. In one of them I was a T-Rex at Disney World and I was having an argument about why I wasn't allowed to ride the Tea Cups ride. I was too big, because I was a T-Rex. Another was me on a cooking show teaching people how to boil an egg, but it was a kinder egg and it went poorly. Most of the dreams were like that, weird and kinda funny, but not scary.

I took the pills for less than 3 weeks, then stopped taking those too. By that point there was no more physical dependency for nicotine, and I had told myself I would never smoke again. And I haven't. It's been over 10 years since I had a cig. "
Buying the brand I don't like did it for me. When it became a bother to go out and smoke one I just kind of gradually lost taste for them. 
"Filling in the habit of when you usually smoke with something else really helped me. For example, if you usually smoke after eating a meal, go take a walk or something.
Also, vaping."
look at the reasons you go for a cigarette and try to change that a little. i found i got most stressed missing my smoke break at work so i went for a break anyways and it made it sooo much better. 
I figured out the best way after smoking for 10 years. First you have to be at that point where you are somewhat disgusted with smoking and feel like you want to quit. Not just randomly quitting. You only want to quit before you go to bed. That evening smoke a lot of really nasty cigarettes. You need to be really disgusted with smoking. Then go to bed sleep 8 or 10 hours wake up you've already got a big head start on clearing it out of your system. Wake up do everything you can possibly do not to smoke. you really won't even feel like having one because of the day before grossing yourself out. Now the real key is in maintaining this not smoking thing never ever have even one single puff of a cigarette don't hang around smokers don't be around smokers don't smell smoke get rid of all the cigarettes ashtrays every single thing related to smoking and don't be around it for 2 weeks at least. I found it takes at least 2 to 3 weeks to really get all the Cravings out of your system then it'll be less and less and instead of trying to survive a day without smoking you'll try and survive a week without it and then a month and then a year I'm going on 20 years not smoking now and I don't miss it. Remember if you have so much as one puff you've given up and you will go back to smoking.
"Carry around a pencil, go outside with your pencil and take the same breaks you would to smoke, but instead of smoking, fiddle with the pencil, even put it in your mouth if so inclined.  It helped me immensely after numerous failed attempts."
"It's been one year for me. Things that have kept me from smoking: 1. Write down why you want to be smoke free. Put it somewhere visible. Reminding myself of long term desires helped me avoid giving into cravings.  2. Tell everyone. Make yourself accountable 3. Now that I can actually smell smoke on others, it truly grosses me out. I still have cravings but the thought of smelling like that again keeps me from buying a pack. "
I used lollies because you can have the same hand motion as a cigarette while sucking them.
Some people say using CBD oil has helped them to stop smoking. Helps to take the edge off of withdrawals.
"This will get buried but if it helps only 1 person it will be worth it.  I was a smoker for 15 years.  In 2018 I decided fuck it, I'm done.  I had tried patches, gum, cold turkey, and vaping before it was a douche sport.  The only one that really worked was Vaping.  I figured now that it was more mainstream it would be easier to obtain the things I needed.  I bought an amazing high wattage Mod with a super douchey huge plume rebuildable vape coil, and tank.  I learned to rebuild my own coils because that is the most expensive part.  To start out I bought 6mg liquid.  I used 6mg liquid for a month until I was no longer craving cigarettes.  Then I went to 3mg liquid for 2 weeks.  At that point I tried to go straight to 0 but found myself craving nicotine.  I started mixing 3mg and 0mg half and half making a 1.5mg liquid.  Used that for 2 weeks and started using 0mg.  I continued using 0mg liquid for all of 3 days before I realized I was no longer craving the nic any longer.  

I stand here today being smoke free and vape free for 6 whole months.  "

"for me it was as simple as accepting that it was just going to suck for a while. once you face that down, that the sucking is just part of it, experiencing it seems a little more routine."
"If you are, ""trying to quit,"" you are not. The urge to smoke isn't going to just go away or get easier unless you just stop smoking already. Like, slow yourself down a bit before quitting, but either you are quitting or you are smoking, there isnt really a, ""trying to quit."""
"First and foremost, you have to want to for your own reasons.  The chances of quitting for someone else is slim, in my opinion.  I smoked for 20 years, and finally decided to quit.  I went cold turkey, and simply stopped buying them.  It was tough, especially considering everyone I worked with smoked.  You just have to want it.  When the urge comes, find something to occupy yourself with. It only lasts a few minutes and gets easier each time.  Lastly, good luck."
"As long as you stay true to reduced the nicotine content as you go, vaping is a great way to start. "
"Not having cigarettes around is a big one, I would always break if I knew there were some around. Then just white knuckling and distracting myself through the cravings, they got less intense after a few weeks. Vaping helped as I missed the physical side of actually having a smoke break. Bar a few sneaky smokes when drinking, has been 3 years off them. Watching my dad die from lung cancer helps me stay off them too, very stark reminder of the consequences"
"I know this isn't applicable to everyone and it wouldn't be easy in a financial sense, but for me what made it easy was going on a two week vacation for Christmas with my family (including my grandparents). Being surrounded by people that not only didn't smoke, but frowned upon it heavily made it almost completely undesirable to even try. The two weeks was enough time for me to lose my appetite for smoking (I had wanted to quit for a while anyway). Before that I smoked about half a pack a day. So I guess my advice would be to put yourself in a situation that makes it very uncomfortable to smoke (in a social sense) if at all possible. "
"Buy the cheapest, nastiest god damned cigarettes you can. 
Then you’ll likely smoke less, and may not even finish it when you do. 
Then remind yourself it’s disgusting and you could spend all that saved money on blow. 
Boom, quit 7 years ago. "
"Patch, the largest one and will power after 6 weeks"
"Vape all you want first. Keep doing that, but drop your nicotine levels until you reach zero. Keep vaping all you want for months. Then, cold turkey or ween off."
"My last cigarette was 10 minutes before my heart attack. I don't recommend doing it that way, but it does work."
"Stop buying cigarettes.  Out of sight, out of mind.  Also I liked using Blow Pops as a craving alternative."
Never got beyond 2 packs a week but eventually I moved out of the place I was living where I had roommate smokers into a new place with a non smoking roommate. I used an e-cig and the highest concentration of nicotine liquid that brand provided. Over the course of several months I slowly reduced the nicotine concentration in the liquid I was buying until I eventually was using 0%. I backslid a few times during this process but I eventually got to a point where I wasn’t using nicotine but was still able to trick my body by going through the motions. I stayed at that point for a while until I eventually looked at the cost and how it kept going up and decided to stop buying more stuff when say the batteries or refill containers broke. At this point I still have some e-cig materials so if I ever have a craving I can use them but haven’t touched them in about 6 months
"You just have to do it. Don't baby yourself. Don't cheat or you will fail. Get it in your head, you're quitting. You are quitting. Make up your mind and do it. Make up your mind to quit, resist the urges. Make up your mind. Decide to quit and follow through. "
Vaping CBD
"Whenever you're hit by a craving, get up and run some flights of stairs, or go for a brisk walk. Get winded. It will remind you of why you quit, distract you, and being short of breath will make smoking feel undesirable."
"I used chantix.

&#x200B;

once I quit with it for about 6 months, but I was still around a lot of smokers especially while shooting on a billiards league.

&#x200B;

the last time, I used chantix again, this time I went through the full recommend routine, the first time I only did the starting part. it  was somewhat tough to tolerate this time at times, but about 6 years later I am still smoke free.

&#x200B;

another thing for me, I always got agitated when people would ask me about it, so I never told anyone not even my wife, except for my boss I also told him I was taking chantix and that I didn't want him to bring it up unless he noticed concerning ""changes"" of mood etc.

&#x200B;

no one knowing I was trying really relieved the pressure to quit and just let me quit.

&#x200B;

I had also tried wellbutrin a little while before even my first bout of chantix, but that shit made me an emotionless zombie, I didn't like it.

&#x200B;

but like they say, chantix, after about a week of taking it you don't get anything out of a cigarette anymore, you can smoke and smoke but you never get that ""reward"" feeling, it starts to just feel pointless, and starts to taste like garbage. you still have to want to quit, but it helped me immensely."
You have to want to quit. If you don't really want to quit you'll never quit. You have to make cigarettes seem like the grossest thing on Earth to you. Good luck. 
"I read a book that changed my life. It's called ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" by Allen Carr. I swear, I never thought just reading a book would ever help me stop smoking ... but it did. Had my last cigarette on July 31, 2011. "
Have a reason to quit.
"I smoked for 16 years, 2 packs of Reds a day, and quit completely cold turkey in 2013. My best two suggestions are to find a few hobbies that can take up your downtime (video games helped me), and to buy some presents for your loved ones as you go because you are going to be a prick for about 3 months. "
"Took a drag one day and said ""this is stupid"" and never touched it again"
"14 months.
Conciously feel the effects on your body, throat , lungs, breathing capacity.
Combine that with exercise and meditation.
The human body aren't made for smoke in the respiratory system."
"Do it today. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Stressful day? Doesnt matter. Fuck you. Stop now. Nut up, stop being a bitch and put it down. It's the most addictive thing on planet earth and no one is going to stop you but yourself. Take some self accountability and just do it this fuckin second. None of this ""I'll just finish this pack"" ""I'll just have one more, a final goodbye"". No. Now. That's what I did. I got sick from withdrawals for two weeks. I pushed through. I got it done. I got over it. Its behind me. "
"My method;
 
I took my last pack of cigarettes and literally taped it to the wall, and wrote on it ""I give up"".  It was in plain sight of everyone in my house.
 
Only rule was that the next time I smoked, it had to be out of that pack.  I could smoke at any time I wanted... I just had to admit to myself and everyone else that it beat me.  That pack is in a box somewhere in storage never opened.
 
It was miserable.  Don't let anyone tell you it won't be... fuck every day for a long time.
 
And it doesn't ever fully go away.  It's been a decade and I won't lie, I'd take a smoke now if I knew it wouldn't get me hooked again (and it wouldn't burn my throat and lungs).  
 
And the health changes aren't the night and day 'amazing' drama people make it out to be.  I didn't suddenly become a gymnast, I just get winded a bit slower and have a MUCH lower chance of getting cancer.
 
So don't expect magic, expect reality.  
 
You should quit.  And it's going to suck.  But if you don't odds are, it's going to suck worse."
wellbutrin!
"Assuming NRT wouldn't work for you, go cold turkey. Every cigarette you don't smoke is a success, don't focus on fighting any craving other than the one you're suffering. You can't beat every craving you will ever have in one shot, but you sure as hell can take them on easy individually. Quitting was easier than expected with this method."
You'll only be able to quit if you really want to.  From my experience there are no real tricks
"Most smokers die from smoking related illness. Chew on that for a bit. It is to hard to quit for someone else, you have to do it for yourself. Get help, cancer societies in most countries in the world have smoking cessation programs. I watched my mom and sister both die from lung cancer. Worked for me, and in hind site i don't know why it was such a big deal to quit. The only rule is you must never have a puff, no cheating. Just like booze, one smoke or drink and you are hooked. "
"My mam is an ex-smoker (close to 15 a day at the worst) and she red a small book by Paul McKenna, some hypnotist guy. She read the book in one night and basically quit the next day. Took her about a week to leave the cravings alltogether."
"It honestly boils down to wanting it bad enough. One day I had trouble breathing after walking to work like 50 ft from my house and knew it was time to stop. 

Also not quitting cold Turkey. I used a combination of e cigarettes, meditation, and weaning.

I also started going on daily walks which kept me busy and feeling good.

another thing I did was designate times to smoke. No cigarettes an hour before and after the gym. No cigarettes 2 hours after waking up and an hour before bed."
"Be petty as fuck and use the fact that someone hid your cigarettes to quit smoking out of pure spite.  

Worked for me anyway. "
The thing that did it for me was one of those Truth commercials. “So...cigarettes definitely cause cancer.” I don’t know why but it clicked with me and I quit cold turkey. Every time I wanted one I’d think “but they definitely cause cancer” 
"I smoked for 25 years. I quit a few times, always the same way, but having everyone around you smoking all the time makes it difficult. I would basically ramp down my smoking, stretching out the periods between cigarettes from hours to days, until I simply didn't feel the need to smoke and would just stop. I personally found it easier than just going straight cold turkey.

The last time I quit was for good. I bought a vape and haven't had a cigarette since. I did try smoking one cigarette about 3 months in, had two drags and said ""fuck that"" as it was disgusting. That was almost 5 years ago, and my lungs are much happier (it only takes a few weeks and you should start noticing the difference, which really helps motivate you). I believe the hardest parts of quitting for many people are the social aspect (I want to hang out with my friends, but what do I do while they smoke? and the physical addiction (what do I do with my hands?!). I found a vape takes care of both of those issues. Having said that, whatever works for you is what you should do. Don't give up...if something doesn't work, try something else. Keep your eyes on the goal, and keep thinking about all the benefits of not smoking."
"1. Don't be around smokers
2. Keep in mind that it's not as hard as people say it is. Big tobacco nurtured that thought to their own ends
3. I started quitting when I got a bad cold and couldn't even look at a cigarette, gave me a little jump start for the first few days
4. Probably the most important part is that there will come a time when you just won't even think about it anymore and it will become nasty again, very nasty"
"My dad stopped for a while but when he started  back up, he said it was because it was part of his routine with work.

Vape.
"Vape, and also just thinking about what you’re doing while you’re doing it.  I noticed that when I smoked i didn’t like stop to think about the taste or how it felt. If you stop to think about it while you smoke you’ll realize itll become gross"
"If you have the will to quit then don’t go to the store for two days. Make sure you are good on gas. Change up everything for two days at least. You see smoking is just a habit so you need to completely break the cycle by not doing the typical stuff that lead you to smoking that cigaret on that hour. Go on a trip or distract yourself with friends and family. Go over and spend time with them. Lastly my last tip is to just stop thinking negatively. If you can go one week, you are free. That’s it! You can go another week and another week for the rest of your life but you need to get over the first big hill. The first 24 might not be the best but after you’ll realize this shit is easy. You might have a urge here and there but nothing like before. Those urges are usually fade quickly. Good Luck and it’s 100% possible. I’ve been smoke free for 2 months."
"I got way too drunk and smoked way more than i normally do in a night and felt miserable the next day from hangover and the gross ""i smoked too much last night"" feeling. I was 26 and that was 3 years ago. Never got over that. Felt sick and nauseous and could feel that gross and hungover feeling any time i thought about smoking. Just never felt like smoking again after that. After a month or two i felt so different. "
"Everytime you want a smoke, think about all the negative things smoking brings you. In the first week I would say them out loud.
Please note that smoking has nothing positive. Even if you think it helps you in stress situations to calm down, this is not true! You give your body stress when smoking. What does help is stepping out of a stressfull situation for 5 to 10 minutes. 
Also, gaining a bit of weight is still a lot healthier then keeping up with smoking.

Also, i put all the money aside that i did not spend on sigarets, and bought myself a new laptop after 9 months... 

Good luck!! "
Buy somethibg that you REALLY want but can't afford if you also have to buy cigarettes . Worked for me.
"And after you've quit: you can never ever ever smoke anything else ever again. A joint - nope. Using a smoking pipe? Nope. I quit for 2.5 years. Cold turkey. Then shared a joint with a friend. Then wanted to share another the next week. You see where this is going. That tiny bit of tobacco is all you need. But it's also the *feeling* of smoke in your lungs. That's why the tobacco-free smoking pipe has to stay off limits forever as well.

STAY QUIT."
"I used to talk mad shit, but vaping really, really helped. "
"I smoked a pack a day till I was 29 and quit cold turkey.

The last day I smoked I got drunk and smoked like a chimney all night . When I woke up the next day hungover as shit, I was sick as a dog so the first day was relatively easy. 

Day two wasn’t so easy

Day three... fucking horrible.. felt like I was getting stabbed in the stomach from withdrawal.  

Every day after that till about 3 months was difficult. Now, 22 years later, it’s not even a thought in my head.

You HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT.. that’s the key

I hope it works out if you try"
"I used the patch and also smoked weed.  It worked.  I was a heavy smoker too (a pack a day).  Weed is not addictive, so you're not really replacing one addiction with another.

Also, any time I had a craving, I thought about all the bad things related to smoking, like getting cancer, smelling like shit, lung pain, the cost of cigarettes, the wasted time, etc.  It helped reduce or eliminate the craving."

Some might disagree but vaping helps some people and is a healthier alternative. The research is still a little shakey on the long term side affects since its a Farley new trend.

"If you listen to Jordan Peterson... you'll have to believe in god and then take magic mushrooms and have a mystical experience. Then, and only then, can you quit smoking."
"I switched to a vape for a while, the main encouragement to keep going was my bank statements, and having an extra $70 every week. It's been about 3 months at this point, and every gas station I pass the thought crosses my kind to stop in and buy a pack, but then I just smell my shirt, and touch my wallet and keep driving. "
"Chantix, the only thing that worked. previously (and unsuccesfuly) I tried in chronological order:

1) Nicorette gum

2) Patches

3) Cold turkey + Licorise

4) Laser accupuncture, total bullshit but amazingly worked for a few days, like a placebo I guess

"Don't feel like you're ""giving up"" something, you'll gain vitality, sense of taste and smell, independence, all while saving money. Plus, not getting lung cancer is pretty nice too.

Key to all addictions is to figure out what to do INSTEAD of your addictive behaviour. What will you do when waiting at the bus station, or after lunch or in a work break? Bring a rubber band and play with that, or solve a quick puzzle on your phone, or whatever, just have something.

For a few weeks, at least. After that, the idea that you could smoke won't pop up in your head any more anyways.

*Edit:* Also, if you just feel you *should* quit smoking, don't even try. If you don't actually *want* to, you won't. Just figure out if you want to be a smoker or a non-smoker, and whatever it is, you can become in this very moment.

No bullshit just a last cig 

Quit now 

Keep your mouth busy for th first few days with those little wooden toothpicks or so "
Really wanting it. I know it's bullshit answer but that's the difference compared to my other half ass attempts. 29 days until my one year.
"Smoke free since Spring 2016. My one piece of advice is quit. That's it. You have to want to quit. I loved smoking, I still miss it to this day, but I just thought to myself I'd hate to get to 50, 60 or beyond if I'm blessed to make old age and I can't keep up with my grand kids because my lungs are falling to bits from smoking all my life. You really have to really think ahead. Just imagine how happy your future self will be that you quit all those years ago. I also used a vape (e-cig) with nicotine to help ease the burden, massive help. Over time I've lowered the nicotine to the now were I have 0mg of nicotine and now I barely use my vape, only in social environments when people are smoking (usually nights out)."
"Well, I suppose I can tell you how I did it. I'm actually really hung up on getting closure on things, as most people are, so what I did was to make the whole thing into an occasion.

It all started with me, on a late Sunday afternoon, realizing I'm almost out of cigarettes. As I stared at the pack I saw there was only one left after I pulled out my after-meal smoke, and like a brick wall it hit me that ""why not the last ever?"" That's when I decided that the next morning I would smoke my last-ever cigarette.

That night I pre-loaded the coffee maker. I tracked down and changed the batteries on this little whisker thing for foaming your milk. I cleaned and put up the hammock and placed a log next to it as a table. I made every effort I could think of to have as comfortable a morning as possible the next day.

So I live in a rural area. The mornings are really nice, but if I just wake up for work I don't really appreciate anything, let alone the little things like crispy air, cozy mist, the sun rising and bird songs. So I woke up early. I started up the coffee and took a long, steaming-hot shower. Forgot to heat the milk before whisking so I accomplished nothing there, but didn't really care because it was a lovely morning and the coffee tasted great anyway. Grabbed an old issue of White Dwarf from my youth on my way out, and enjoyed the hell out of everything.

I was in a good mood the whole day. Think it's about five years ago now, went cold-turkey and haven't really thought about it since."
I pictured my cravings as a child.  They would cry and throw tantrums.  I would send them to their room.  Tough love. 
"For those considering quitting cannabis, I highly recommend r/leaves. "
"Do it for you, no one else. You have to WANT to quit."
"Try Chantix. You may be one of the lucky ones that have little to no bad side effects, as I was. That's how I quit."
When I quit smoking I started drinking. Only problem was whenever I drink i crave cigarettes. So I quit drinking and replaced that with coffee. And now I can’t sleep so I don’t know what to do. 
"1) You have to have *decided* you don't want to smoke any more. This can only come from your own brain - people can influence you, and that is helpful to get you along the parh, but at the end of the day the choice has to be yours.

2) Use a tracking app to keep track of days not amoked, money saved, health gained... etc. I used ""Smoke Free"" and it was a fantastic way to conceptualize what I was gaining every day by choosing not to smoke.

3) Jump on r/stopsmoking, and realize just how not alone you are.

4) Excercise!!"
"Vape. One year without smoking. Even the first week was okay. You need to find a shop that help people quit smoking rather than the trend for flavoured dense foggy shit.
Salesman has to provide you a liquid that fits your needs regarding your nicotine consumption and a machine that deliver the right amount of smoke/vape that you can bear and that feels like your way of smoking.
If Im in a good way to stop everything, and I am, you have lot of chances to quit too.
"
"After many failed attempts, I finally quit for good in 2001.  First, you have to have a sincere desire to quit. Second, change one habit that triggers a craving. For me, I quit getting a cup of coffee for my drive to work.  When someone asks you if want a smoke, remove the word ""try"" from your response.  Instead of saying l'm trying to quit, say no thanks, I quit.  It might sound dumb, but it reenforces your decision to quit.  Lastly, it takes a about two weeks to get over the physical craving for nicotine. If you can go two weeks, you can succeed.  Good luck. 
"
"Someone I know did this: 

Get a locked money box and start filling it up with what you would have spent on ciggies every day. Have a target in mind of what you're saving up to buy yourself with this money."
"Have a good reason to quit or something to quit for.  Without that something or reason, you will fail...and fail you will.  It took me a good 7 to 10 times before it stuck.  Been smoke free for 11 years now, hardest thing Ive ever done.  Dont give up."
This obviously isn’t the best solution but I just started smoking pot instead. When ever I’d get a craving I’d just smoke a joint and forget the craving!  
"I kept remembering someone telling me that after 3 days the headaches and physical urges really die down and it becomes a lot easier. After 3 days I found this to be true and it was much easier from then on out. Kind of like accomplishing one goal, then onto the next mentality.

&#x200B;

The hardest part is the *habit* of smoking, not the addiction, at least for me. Like longer car rides, down times at work, after drinking, at parties, that sort of stuff. Powering through that kind of urge will always be a struggle, but it does get easier over time. Replacing it with other activities like exercising really did help."
It’s not just one big decision to quit. You have to decide to quit minute by minute at first... then it’s hour by hour and then day by day... eventually you don’t have to make the decision consciously anymore. 
"E-cig. Gradually step down to zero nicotine, and then no ecig."
Don't 
Persevere. I went from around 30 a day to cold turkey. Fell off the wagon a couple of times but then the days with out smoking got longer. Have now not smoked for over 13 years. I still get cravings every now and again but the smoking days are gone.
"First, good for you for wanting to give it a(nother) try! I wish you all the luck in the world, and feel free to message me if you need help! A couple things worked for me. First and most important, you have to be ready. Like actually ready to make a major lifestyle change. Second do not use replacements! I tried gum, patches, vapes, everything, but the only thing that worked for me is just stopping... cold turkey. Third, realize that it’s not a one time decision. Every time you light a cigarette you make a decision to smoke. Same idea, but way harder. For the first few months you will constantly make the decision to not smoke. Every 5-10 minutes you will get a craving, so be prepared for the temptation numerous times per hour. Fourth, I did not throw away my open pack of cigarettes or my lighters. I realized this time that it is likely I would cheat, so knowing I had that as an option if I really needed it was a mental comfort. I didn’t use it, but knowing it was there helped. Most important, was to keep myself busy constantly for the first week or so. I vacuumed the house a couple times a day, I washed my car every day, I did laundry, I took the dog for a walk, I pulled weeds, I did everything I could possibly think of to keep my hands and mind busy while my cravings were the worst. It worked for me, but it is not easy! Last cigarette was August 31, 2010."
I got a vape then slowly lowered the nicotine level. I haven’t smoked a cigarette since June of 2016. It really works. My husband (2 packs a day) quit that was as well over a year ago.
"What did it for me was

1) No smoking inside the house. It meant going out to the balcony freezing my balls off every time I wanted a cig. That made it lose part of the appeal big time

2) Less stress. Sounds obvious but honestly part of  my craving triggers were stress. When I changed jobs I cut my daily cigs from 20 to 10 in a single day. That was a big wake up call

3) Decided that my aim was to smoke less every day, not ""quit"" so if I wanted the one cig, I'd just have it and not take it as a failure. Also I'd just tell people I was trying to cut down instead of quitting so if they ever saw me smoking I wouldn't have to put up with them telling me stuff like ""oh that's too bad you were doin so well"" blablabla"
"Honestly, decide it for yourself, you’ll stick to it. I decided twice for my girlfriend and it never worked, one day, went upstairs in a building and thought to myself “are you gonna be that guy that can’t talk to your customers cuz there was like 12 steps ?” That night, I had the last one, it was a year ago (09/19) "
Use a vape to ween down on the nicotine. Gives you a way to inhale while controlling your intake. Eventually just vaping juice with no nicotine and stopping altogether
"I used to smoke a pack a day. 


I know reddit tends to hate on vapes, but it feels to me that their original intention was to help people quit smoking. Vape shops will offer the nicotine juice in various flavors and concentrations. 


I quit smoking by buying a vape with a flavor I enjoyed, and I high nicotine concentration. The only problem was, I was then addicted to vaping. 


To quit vaping, I gradually lowered the concentration of the juice I bought until it was almost zero (you can accomplish this by buying a zero concentration and mixing it with a low concentration). Then, I switched flavors to something I DID NOT LIKE.  That way, I was only tempted to use the vape when I was really craving nicotine. Eventually, you grow to despise the taste so much, it becomes unappealing and you quit all together. 


I understand the health effects of vaping have not been studied as extensively as tobacco use. However, this is a shorter term solution than any others I have seen, and is the only way I was able to quite. I haven’t had a cigarette in three and a half years. 


Hope it helps! "
Stop buying cigarettes. Quit 5 years ago and never looked back.
"1. Want to quit

2. Separate yourself from situations, especially social ones, where you are tempted to smoke. This was key for me. My friends were all smokers and it was too enabling when they would all take smoke breaks. This is the hardest part for most people imo. I only quit after I moved to a different city for other reasons.

3. I did not quit cold turkey. I took about a month or so to wean myself. I would stave off the temptation a long as possible throughout the day. After a few weeks I was down to one cigarette at the end of the day. Then I would smoke half a cigarette a day. At that point it was easy to quit.

I only smoked for 2-3 years and I quit ~8 years ago. I still have dreams where I start up smoking again."
Bubblegum. Have cravings? chew one. Having craving again while chewing gum? Chew another one and another. And another.
"I used Chantix.  After a few days of taking it and not smoking, the thought of smoking made me sick.  I still dream of having a cigarette, and in the dream it’s the best thing ever, but when I wake up, I feel nauseated.  "
"I want to quit, but I also don't want to go without it.. "
Ex-smoker for 2 years. I started with going down with the everyday dosage until I mustered the will to finally stop. The best tip I have is making it hard for yourself to be able to smoke and also telling a close friend/relative to help you stop the craving.
"Keep on quitting! Quit every new years, quit every birthday, every new moon, every first of the month, every monday and every day. One Monday will be that lucky one where it will work. Just never give up.
People tried to tell me naahh that will just make you feel like a failure every time and you quit quitting but there must be 2 kind of people in the world.
Conquer one addiction at a time. "
"Just.  Keep.  Quitting. 

It takes time, effort and persistence, and it won't go right the first time.  That doesn't mean anything is wrong.  Just.  Keep.  Quitting."
"A lot of good advice in here already. For me, limiting my time around people who are actively smoking helps a lot. At some point in your journey to quitting you'll find yourself hanging around friends having a good time and have a quiet realisation that a smoke won't make you feel better right now, which is honestly the best piece of encouragement I have had. "
"If you happen to move house, take that opportunity. I tried so many times and it was quitting when I moved that finally did it. My new deck wasn’t a smoke spot like the old one, it was a just a deck, because I never let myself smoke at the new place.

Smoke free for three or four years now."
"Read Alan Carr's EasyWay.

Everyone I know who's actually finished the whole book has successfully quit. I have a bunch of friend who stopped reading it because they knew they'd stop if they read to the end. What a bunch of idiots"
"I just started mass consuming bananas. Friends having a smoke, have a banana. I used to buy the 6 packs and carry them around"
"I quit many years ago by simply cutting my smoking in half every week until I was down to less than one cigarette a day. You can cut down at whatever rate you want, half every week was just what I used. Started out at 30 a day (a LOT of cigarettes!!) cut down to 15, the next week 7 a day, and so on and so on. I had started out at a pack and a half, so it took me a while but it didn't feel as daunting as quitting cold turkey and by the time I got down to one or two drags of a cigarette a day smoking had become more of a hassle than something I looked forward to.

When I got down to that level I went on a long hike into the wilds with some friends. I was a day and a half hike away from cigarettes for a week and a half. It was so beautiful and I was working hard physically every day so I didn't miss cigarettes at all. By the time I got back from the hike I had lost all interest in smoking.

Best decision I ever made, and I am happy I stuck with it. My health is so much better now, I have more money and a lot less social stigma. Just do it. It's so worth the effort. You can do it. When I began that process of quitting, I was someone who *loved* smoking, and I had no faith in my ability to quit. I thought it was going to be impossible because I didn't really want to quit. But here I am 20 years later and still smoke free. If I can quit, anyone can."
Find that circumstances where you most commonly smoked. Slowly work  out the habit during those. The tough part for me was when I drove. I used to always smoke when I drove. To and from work. To the store. Across the state. Always when I drove. And it was in that setting that it was the hardest to kick. I now chew gum when I drive. Or munch on sunflower seeds for long drives. It did the trick.
"I smoked for 15 years and was almost up to 2 packs a day.  I used the gum, worked fairly well but it isnt for everyone. "
Try cigars. A lot less harmful and doesn't kill the lungs.
"Alan Carr's easy way to quit smoking helped me get into the mindset.

I went cold turkey for a year and three months and then I smoked a cigarette when Trump was elected, and then here a there afterward, usually when drinking, but those cigs just cemented that they're not really fun since they made me feel terrible right after. I can't remember my last one, or drag. Probably spring. "
My only tip is get a vaporizer and some juice you like then ween yourself off of that. Only thing that worked for me.
"Some perspective. I was a smoker for 20 years before I was diagnosed with cancer in 2014. I'm sure my smoking had a lot to do with the diagnosis. Anyway, I was told by the doctors that I needed to quit smoking right away. I tried in the past with no success, but when so much is on the line it makes it much easier. As a matter of fact, I haven't had a cigarette since even though I still miss the taste. My point is, if you need to quit it's easy, so the want to quit has to be strong. Vaping helped with the transition for sure. I'd recommend vaping to anyone who wants to stop smoking. You can progressively dial down the nicotine and once you're at 0% nicotine, just stop vaping. "
"I quit ten years ago cold turkey. After repeated attempts the final time was was ironically the easiest. I didn't just quit smoking, but to also changed my daily routine.

You know, morning coffee and a smoke? Don't just skip the smoke. Skip that coffee too! Get some juice, cereal or whatever, and have it in a different manner than you did with the coffee and smoke. Smoke a lot when having a drink out at a bar? Don't drink or go to the bar for a few months to remove that temptation. Love that after meal smoke? Have an after meal espresso instead!

I had the added advantage of changing jobs which was able to give me a new commute as well as a new routine at work. Together it made quitting smoking 100x easier than all the previous attempts. 

Smoking is half routine and half addiction. Change your routine to help yourself quit."
"I pretended quitting was easy to impress a girl who wouldn’t date me because I smoked.  I tossed out my smokes in front of her to show her how I was serious. She bought it and we ended up dating for 2 years. 

Once I did it I was pretty much committed at that point. The first few days were tough but I just focused on the sex and that it was worth it. "
"Drink juice and eat candy. Juice acidifies your urine and makes you excrete nicotine faster. Candy helps keep your oral fixation occupied. Both will help with blood sugar levels, which smokers often don't realize will tank when you quit smoking because nicotine releases blood sugar and without it you actually have to eat. "

Tell yourself in your mind over and over that you are stronger than cigarettes.
"I would quit for months , smoke socially at a party and then slowly begin smoking more and more . This has been my pattern for years . Finally quit with a free app .  "
"Whenever I had the urge to smoke I would replay the line from Labyrinth in my head, ""you have no power over me"".  Worked for me since I hated the feeling of needing something that bad."
"Do not have a last cigarette.  Just quit on the spot.
Smoking weed every night helps too. "
Ummm mobile games.  I spent all my cig money on mobile games for like 6 months .... now im trying to start smoking again to save some money.
"Throw away whatever pack you currently have without finishing it. It's too easy to say ""I'll do it just after this"" for years.

Then, just don't buy another one. After the withdrawal, you're free. Cold turkey takes a little will power and like 2 weeks time, then you're free.

Also, it's helpful to remember the cost. If you're a pack a day smoker, and let's say your brand is $5 each (estimate, obviously depends on brand and area) then you save 5*365=$1825 a year! I'm sure you can think of some cool stuff to do with an extra $1.8k!

You got this, go for it!"
When smoking hand rolled - do something with your hands. I did it with a green biro ( learn to spin it!) plus peeling satsumas.
"Full stop, cold turkey. I used sunflower seeds to help the cravings. You will gain weight, a good chunk of people do when they quit. 

Fuck patches, fuck gum, just find something to curb the craving and kick that shit. "
Had a mental breakdown and smoking cigs actually makes you more susceptible to that happening. Cigs also give you anxiety. Do hard cardio that naturally make release feel good endorphins in your brain. Nothing good ever happens for feeling sorry for yourself! best of luck !!!
"Hey OP, I had been tired of smoking for years and decided that I would orally take e-juice to supplement the nicotine while my oral fixation dwindled. So far I've gone 2 months with no cigarettes and only dose 2-3 times a day. I plan on being off nicotine in a couple weeks. Hope this helps! 

Oh. Btw I use 6mg e juice."
"SO found our 2yo playing with his packet of cigarettes and that was a wake up call. He is now a ""social smoker"" only smokes once a month when he's at the pub. Saves $200pw (they're really expensive in New Zealand) I've never pressured him to quit and v. proud he took the initiative. Also setting realistic expectations helps. "
"Speaking from my own experience, dont try to quit until you have 100% made up your mind that you are going to quit. Its way too easy to slip back into the habit if you arent 100% commited mentally to do it. 
Let those you value around you know that you have quit and roughly how long its been because mood swings are very common; it may help them be more forgiving when/if you're a dick to them.
Try to pick up another habit to occupy the time. I switched up to going outside and doing push ups and quick exercise. For those with the oral fixation, try using flosser picks/toothpick as an alternative healthy habit. 
Good luck and believe in yourself and your health!"
"I'm not a smoker, but my brother quit cold turkey one particularly brutal summer in college when his dorm AC went out.  He decided that being heat-miserable would take his mind off of cigarettes.  He said that it definitely made a huge difference for him, and made it much easier to quit.  

So those people wanting to quit... if you don't mind being hot for a few weeks, shut your HVAC down next summer and see if it works for you.  "
I quit smoking long before vaping was a thing. What I did was smoke sage.
"Foreword: I'm too lazy to read any of the other replies. 

Continuing: Switch to american spirits. 

I used to smoke marlboros and newports and they were hard af to quit (especially menthol cigs). I switched to american spirits and i noticed i wasnt satisfied (at all) after smoking them. But I stuck it out and after a while it was easy to quit. 

Two main reasons: 
1) They taste like dirty asshole. 
2) They only contain nicotine. 

P.s. American spirits contain a freebased form of nicotine that should theoretically be harder to quit - but since its the only ingredient, and not a synergistic cocktail of like a dozen addictive ingredients -its still waaay easier to quit smoking them. "
"Apart from that, take a moment to analyze your habits, e.g. what time you smoke, during what activities, after what events... Knowing when youre gonna have a craving helps you combat it. "
"
Drinking and not smoking is exponentially hardest. idk.  all bets are off or I'm grinding my teeth with a scotch glass in my hand.

Nicotine is evil, it is the devil, it stays with you.  I was in withdrawal 3 months. I curse it damnation.

It's stupid, smoke in the lungs, what more encouragement do you need along with a dozen diseases and cancer.  Study the lungs, look at the devastation.

"I used an e-cigarette. The mental habit was surprisingly easy to quit. I had tried 6 times prior.
The physical habit was a bitch and caused relapse. Eventually, the physical habit just became a single problem to focus on. It was subsequently easier to quit.
What I learned on my way was that it's a two stage process. The physical and mental habit loop. I guess without thinking I tackled them individually and won. Smoke free since 2013."
"If you're into trying drugs to help you quit, Wellbutrin can help."
"Stop buying them. This should be the easiest step for a lot of people.

Now, you probably have smoker friends. Don't excuse yourself with them when they step outside. Don't bum smokes.

People bitch about the addiction and the cravings, that's a load of shit. Get over yourself. If you care, you'll quit. They're cigarettes, not liquor, not meth, not cocaine. The addiction isn't nearly as strong as people fucking pretend it is, they're just really fucking easy to buy and really easy to bum here and there."
"You have to want to quit.  When you find yourself reaching for a cigarette STOP.  Tell yourself "" I will skip this one..the next time I want one I can smoke""  Then wait until the urge hits again and indulge.  I went from a pack a day to 2 a day.  At that point it is semantics.  Don't tell yourself you can't smoke..just make yourself wait.  Again..If you don't really want to quit there is no point trying."
"The biggest obstacle for me was driving, I always wanted a cigarette while driving. I kept things like suckers or tic tacs in my car to munch on until I no longer craved to smoke. 

It's been 3 years and for the most part I'm doing great, but I still very occasionally want a cigarette when I'm stressed, drinking, or sometimes just ramdomly. I remind myself of the time I quit for 5 months, and after giving in from stress I was smoking more than ever! Almost 2 packs a day! I dont want to ever go back to that."
"Okay, my process of quitting was long and came in stages, but I'll share one thing that I used for myself. I try to take care of myself, workout, eat healthy, wear sunscreen so I don't get skin damage. I never noticed smoking affecting how I looked, but knew it could down the line. I mean ABSOLUTELY NO OFFENSE to anyone, but what I did was take note of people I saw in their cars smoking cigarettes. I noticed how, even if they looked young and clean, just the visual of them smoking made me think their whole car and person was kinda grimey. I realized that's probably what I look like. Then I paid special note to the people smoking who are older, and how wrinkley their skin looked and they just looked stale. And how they probably didn't think they came off that way, as I hadn't. I figured I didn't want that to be me and it helped, especially in those times of car-cravings. "
Start vaping.
Make sure whatever you're using to supplement the oral fixation has a limited supply.  That's a major issue when someone is trying to quit.  
"First time I tried to quit, I started vaping. It made it so much worse.

Second time I was going through a divorce and just wanted to feel better about myself. I started again after meeting my second wife who smoked.

After we found out we were pregnant, it took us both about 2 weeks. It’s been 1 1/2 years now. We both occasions have a smoke (once or twice a year) but feel like shit afterwards.

Pro tip: get preggers.

Joking aside, doing it for someone other than myself made it easier for me."
"Don't lie to yourself.  
 
""I'll just have one and be ok""  

No you won't. You'll be back to a pack a day in a week. "
"Not me, but my uncle told me that a heart attack is the most effective anti-smoking message he ever got.  He got up one morning, took his first drag of the day, and felt the worst pain of his life in his chest, shooting into his left arm.  Never touched another one."
"Maybe try a vaporizer, got me and my parents off cigarettes. Made quitting a lot easier for us."
You must REALLY WANT to quit. I found bike racing and since I am not Mario Cippolini I had to quit to have a prayer of competing. 
"Among many of the other tips I'm sure you'll see; I only pay for gas at the pump when I fill up my car. That way I don't go inside the store and see the wall of cigarettes tempting me. Bonus, it also prevents me buying energy drinks and other stuff."
"Quit Caffeine first. 50% of your cravings are from Caffeine but you don't realize it.

Then, just... quit. Power through. I sleep a lot for three days. After that, it's a lot easier.

That's it. Took me 4 tries over several years before I finally REALLY made it stick, but I've been smoke free for 8 years this month and have no desire to go back.

I was a smoker for 30 years prior to finally quitting."
Taking Wellbutrin pills. Worked amazingly well. Had to take them for a full year before my brain started working right. 
"Willy Nelson method... I rolled up 20 joints and put them in my pack and changed my habit. I was at a pack a day; By day 3, I had only managed to get through 12"
"My dad put all the ashes and cigarette butts in a jar for a week or two; he then opened the jar and smelled inside. He was so disgusted with the smell that he felt ashamed that, by smoking next to non-smokers, they had to smell that disgusting smoke. Left it right away and hasn't smoked in more than 25 years."
"First thing is not buying cigarettes. Second thing is avoiding people who smoke. 
Third thing is don't go out for a while. No drinks with buddies. 
Fourth thing is clean up your diet. Mostly vegetables, all home cooked. 
Fifth thing is start a project. Study for a certification or build something with woodwork. 
Sixth thing, exercise daily. 
Seventh and last thing, every time you're dying for a cigarette, take 10 dollars and put it in a piggy bank, preferably one you can't open without destroying it. 

Maintain this lifestyle for 3 days, then another week, then another 3 weeks, then another 2 months, then another 3 months, and give it another 3 months. 

Come back in 9 months and tell us how your life is going. "
"The accomplishment of being an ex-smoker is on you alone. Realizing that it is you that needs to believe in your capabilities is empowering. Focus on those little moments of win.

Also, don't plaster it all over for people to know you're attempting to quit. Including others for moral support is important, but too much and too soon can make one feel like THEIR own accomplishment is no longer ultimately their own responsibility. It is too much pressure and you can get inside of your head.

In five days, I'll be smoke-free for 3 years. (I started at about 12 years old and smoked til I was  26). 

I had what I see now as a ""perfect timing"" situation that is not going to happen for most. I was suffering from a severe cough due to a cold and I also was just tired. Slept all day. Woke up in the evening and had a realization I hadn't smoked (due to sleeping the whole day AND realizing whenever I had a craving, it wasn't worth it to get out of bed) and I decided to focus on that little triumph and see what happened. 

I went the next day with no smoking and in the middle of the third, I told my boyfriend that I hadn't smoked, let alone missed it too much.  Every day since, it got easier and easier and now I have little moments where I have to focus to recall that I used to be a smoker. It's surreal.

From my own experience, I say just focus on the little winning feeling you get  each time you resist a craving and DON'T make it anyone else's business but your own until you feel more confident and understand that YOUR own goal is attainable by just yourself. If I included others for support (as I did in attempts prior) I always felt like I let them down and it became a ""community project,"" while I scapegoated my own failures in a way. 

EDIT: I had 2 mini relapses (both while I was intoxicated) in later months where I bought a pack of smokes. I smoked 2 from the first pack and 1 from the next, each time throwing the pack triumphantly into the trash when I was sober and didn't actually like the taste/experience. Wasted money by not smoking them and tossing them is shitty but it's more shitty waste of money to smoke them, too."
"A lot of answers here tell you to replace with with something else, but honestly I think it's more deep seated than that.  It's a matter of self control which is something that can be worked on. Find ways or methods to improve your self control and you will find smoking and olto fall straight in line with everything else.  You have to want it for it to happen.  "
"1. Make a quit date and stick to it. 
2. Use the Smoke Free app to track your time since last smoke. Looking at that is a good way to boost yourself through some rough points. Its been (x) much time since i last smoked, if i pick up a cig now thats (x) amount of time i spent suffering for nothing,  and I'll just have to do it all again. 
3. Gum, fidget spinners, rubber bands. Keep things around to occupy your hands. 
4. Spoil yourself with the money you save. I bought a new phone after 30 days, cig money payed for it all. Having something to show for what youve been going through is nice. 
5. Stick this motto into your mind, repeat it 5000 times a day if you need to, ""not another puff, no matter what."" Drive that finality home. No. Matter. What. And if you can take it, you can make it. No matter how bad you feel, you will make it through. Just tough through it and you'll be golden. 
Love all you guys, you deserve to make this change and good luck! "
Oh also throw away all smoking paraphernalia. You don't need ash trays or lighters around if your truly committed to quitting. Throw em away now and thank yourself later
"For me I needed a reason, smoking was a small reprieve from my anxiety, and every time I tried to quit I just felt like I couldn't give up that 10 minutes of ""me time"". Then I got a positive pregnancy test and quit cold turkey, handed what was left of my pack to my partner and said ""Well, you're gonna be a daddy, hide these."" And they did.

I'm now 5 months and 2 weeks into my pregnancy and I still occasionally want a cigarette, but I want a healthy child more. It also made me realize I wasn't being the best mom I could be to my other two children and I need healthier coping mechanisms or I could possibly not be around to watch my kids grow up and have families of their own.

So I feel if someone is serious about quitting they should try to find a reason that's important to them."
"The pain and suffering of withdrawal is a great motivator for me. If I go through that for a whole day, and then think about just giving up and having a smoke, I realize that all that pain was for nothing. So I just tough it out a little longer. Then when it's been three days, and I'm nearly ready to chew furniture, that's even more suffering that's all for nothing if I just give up. 

Then it's been a week, and there's even more torture you've been through. Give up now and what a horrible waste!

Then after two or three weeks, the suffering isn't all that bad anymore. Then when all that poison is finally out of your system, you have a real sense of pride and accomplishment (not the EA kind). If you went back to it now, how foolish would you feel?

I realized something else important with all drugs out there. They're all based on poisoning you. You take the drug (in whatever form) and your body kicks in to release the right chemicals to fight the poison. The ""High"" you feel is from your own body's reaction, not from the drug itself. The drug is actually just trying to kill you. This is why the drug's effect diminishes over time and you need more and more. Because your body can no longer produce as much happy chemicals to fight for its life. 

Nicotine is just poison. But it triggers happy chemicals in you that makes you feel like the nicotine caused it. Knowing that, I didn't love nicotine as much anymore. I loved my own body for trying to save me from it."
"Yoga in general helped the most, and taking a walk instead of a smoke break. Replacing the 'ritual' of smoking with something else helps a lot of people. I've also heard success stories of people who quit when they make another change (like new apartment or job etc). "
"If you smoke to cope with stress or some such, figure out a way to cope with something other than cigarettes so that you can still fill that need that cigarettes were giving you."
What worked for me was not buying them ever. I would bum one every now and then for some time after quitting but I made it a rule to never buy them again. Eventually I didn’t enjoy them when I bummed them.
I didnt quit. I stopped buying packs and my latest one ran out 7 months ago. I do not feel like asking people for their money/cigarettes so now I am not a smoker.

"i just had my 10 year anniversary!  

over the years i had made a few semi-concerted efforts to quit but ended up giving up on all of them.  i quit when i was pregnant, and by the time baby was a year old i was starting to smoke again.  

i felt really bad about smoking though, guilty, because i was doing something so potentially harmful to my health when i now had a small person counting on me to be around.  i ended up psyching myself out of smoking.  i became so preoccupied with developing breast or lung cancer that it became stressful to smoke -- each time i was thinking this is the one that is starting the cancer.  when my vacation was over and i went back to work i told myself i would quit when i got my first illness of the school year.  in the meantime i would have one on the way to work, and one on the way home and that was it.  two weeks into the school year, i got my first cold, and just stopped.  the one big concession i made was i stopped drinking coffee, because it was a trigger.  i started drinking it again eventually, and i haven't had a cigarette since.

"Be reaistic about what it's gonna be like. The first thing I thought was ""It's gonna take me about two years no less"", and that's exactly what I told my mother. There periods when I smoked about 2 or 3 cigarettes per week and then I would resort back to 10 a day. But I didn't care, having given myself 2 years to adjust it always felt like great progress when I managed to smoke only 3 cigarettes a day. Two years later, and the only time I smoke is when I'm super drunk and there's someone around to treat me a cigarette (I know too well by now that buying a pack is not worth the trouble - I won't want to do anything with it in the morning already). I've been an active smoker for 11 years (I smoked about 10-15 cigarettes a day)."

Eat carrot sticks . You don't put on weight by doing this. 
"Take it one minute at a time at first. After awhile those minutes will turn into hours then turns into days until you have learned to live without it.

Know your triggers and be prepared to double down to tough it out when they happen.

Don't give up even if you slip, it will happen.

And after 5 years of being smoke free don't think you can sit at the bar having a few brews with friends and think you can have one because you beat it. Because if you do you'll be buying a pack before you go home.

Like the wife says: ""the cigarette was the end of the meal"", so control your eating, that can be as hard as quitting.

I've also worked with someone that used Chantix and they quit like it was nothing and didn't gain weight.

Good Luck"
"20 year smoker here.  I used the patches.  There was one morning a week after quitting when I got up, got ready for work and started my commute into town.  About half way to work I realized  I hadn't thought about smoke since I woke up. This is when I knew I could do it.  The first week was the foundational layer and I ended up just adding days onto it ever since.  That was 10 years ago.  

I'm not saying it was a walk in the park, but time goes by and eventually I realized it had been a week since I stopped.  Then It was two, then three and so on.  I thought about it less and less and one day I realized I was going to bed and hadn't thought about smoking all day, then all week, all month and so on.  

Good luck.  You can do it.  "
"Little known fact: cigarettes are known to be more difficult to quit than Heroin (not speaking from experience on the heroin part)

YOU CANNOT QUIT BECAUSE OF SOMEONE ELSE.

I've been smoking for 17 years ( started when i was around 13 or so) and i quit a few months back. The thing you have to do is just simple resist the urge to smoke when you are seriously craving one. Allow a few minutes to pass when you have the crazy itch to light one up. It sounds so damn silly but it truly helps the cravings pass. The important thing to do is remind yourself why you quit. Keep that goal in mind.

&#x200B;

My cousin is a Marathon runner and he's told me on a few occasions that when he's in the middle of the race he's literally yelling at him self because of the pain in his legs and the strain it puts on his body and (amidst the run) he tells himself ""that's it as soon as this is over, I'm never signing up for another one again."" As soon as he finishes his race, he can't wait to run his next marathon because of how good it felt to over come his strong urge to simply give up. 

&#x200B;

I use that as an example because of his true inner strength and desire to make himself better. Even when you want to throw in the towel and just say fuck it, just remember why you started it in the first place: to enhance the quality of your life and to achieve something you, by your own volition, decided this is the best choice of your life "
Dont drink for the first 3 months.
"Let people know that you are quitting, specially your smoker friends, as having someone around you smoking can make it very difficult for you to resist. Also, put yourself in situations where you can't smoke, like going to non-smoking bars, or setting a rule for yourself that you can't smoke anywhere inside your house. These did the trick for me. "
"Not me, but my dad has been smoking for 20+ years and finally decided to quit for good when it finally hit him that his health is really deteriorating. He had a bad panic attack once and from then on he started going to the doctor, where he got recommended for Chantix. It wasn't a smooth transition as he did have a lot of urges and mood swings. He tried lollipops and patches along the way but Chantix proved the most effective. It's also a mental game, so when I see him really down I try to take him outside for a walk or join him binge watch something (I got him pretty hooked up on GoT). 

For the past few months, he's been going to different doctors for physical check-ups and fortunately there wasn't anything major for us to worry about. Now he's very focused on staying healthy, going smoke-free for a year now. "
"Slow the drinking down, switch to filterless. "
When you want to quit you do. It is not a secret.
"Don't plan it. Don't reason yourself to it. Just stop. Keep your last pack on you, as a constant reminder.

If you slip up, don't despair.

After a few months, cigarette smoke will nauseate you. It gets easier.

"
"Chantix isn't for everybody, but it was like a miracle cure for me.  Within the first two weeks of taking it, I went from a *minimum* pack-a-day habit to having no urge to smoke whatsoever. I smoked for over a decade till then, but I've never had a single craving since."
But... I like it.
"Quitting smoking is like any other difficult choice that improves your life; it is never a single decision. You are going to face the choice, ""Do I smoke or not smoke?"" And you are going to have to make that hard choice repeatedly, all day every day, for the foreseeable future. 

If you fail to quit smoking, it will be because a time came where you asked yourself, ""Should I choose to be strong and not smoke, or should I just give up and smoke?"" and you will have made the easy choice.  The easy choice only leads to failure. You have to make the hard choice, over and over again, until your body and routine adjust and you finally stop forcing yourself to make the decision. 

Take a person who has never smoked a cigarette in their life. How much time do you think they spend thinking about cigarettes and deciding if they should smoke? Probably about zero. That thought, that decision, it isn't something they're faced with regularly, and that is where you are trying to get to. You want to let your physical urges pass, and you want your daily routine to not feel like there are gaps where your cigarette breaks used to be. 

For the first couple weeks, you have to realize, there are going to be cravings and urges. You are going to want to smoke. You will say to yourself, ""Of course I can't just quit, it's the hardest thing in the world, everyone knows that, so it just makes sense if I give up and fail because it's what you do."" That's bullshit, just a rationalization you'll try to feed yourself in order to make that easy decision seem more appealing and the hard choice unreasonable. Feeling an urge, feeling the desire to smoke and saying to yourself, ""No, I am not a slave to my impulses, I want to be a non-smoker more than I want to be a weakling who gives up the first time they have to make a hard choice, so I am going to choose to not smoke even though part of me wants it,"" THAT is quitting. That's what it comes down to. Making yourself make the hard choice over and over again. 

I think grasping that makes it easier. You want to smoke, you say to yourself, ""I knew I was going to feel this, I knew I was going to want to give in, I knew I was going to have to make this hard choice repeatedly, and now I'm making it.  This is how I quit, one choice at a time.""

After enough time passes, you find yourself having to make the hard choice less and less. You want to give up on your progress less and less as your smoke-free streak grows.  Your lungs start to feel better. You start realizing how much your sense of smell and taste are coming back, surprised because you never realized how much smoking killed those senses. Eventually, you catch a whiff of someone's cigarette smoke, and it instantly gives you a headache and turns your stomach a little bit. You think of having a smoke and feel nothing but mild disgust, and you realize that you've finally become a non-smoker. It's over. You have reached your goal, with nothing but positives to show for it.  

Steel yourself. Prepare to make the hard choice. Don't tell yourself it's ok to give up. Don't make excuses for yourself. Be a non-smoker. You deserve it. "
"I've been quit for about a year and a half. I don't crave anymore, but I still think, ""Oh, I could duck into that shop and buy just one stick if I wanted"". Its just a passing thought and its good not having to struggle with those thoughts any more, but I still wish they wouldn't come up.

In terms of the actual quitting, I had tried patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, e-cigs, and various prescription medications. Some would have me only cutting down, while others might help me to quit for weeks or months at a time. What I did differently this time was fasting, no nicotine replacement therapies at all. Try fasting from sun rise to sunset, no food, no water...no cigarettes...nothing. For me, this approach cut one of the behavioural links in the chain, the association between food/drink and smoking. And at night, when you can eat and drink, I found that I was too exhausted to want to go out and buy a packet, so I just went to bed. It was actually easier quitting this way that it was with nicotine replacement therapy. But I know it doesn't work with everyone. I've seen Muslims fasting too and a lot of them rush straight to the cigarettes before food and drink as soon as their fasting day is over."
"As others have said, you need to want to. For me, it was a way to save $5000/year. And not get cancer.

I vaped for a long time, but wouldn't recommend it. Made it harder for me since it's always right there and you don't have to go outside to use it. It also made me feel like a massive douche in public.  

Nicorette really helped. Eventually you just have to go a few shitty days where you want to yell for little to no reason and eventually stop. You'll always have cravings. It's never over but does get better as time goes on. "
"Cold Turkey. The only way I could do it (twice). There were a few motivating factors.  First time I was lucky, I was pregnant. The second time I quit, I just stopped. Every day  I didn't smoke, I would write $7.00 (the price of of a pack) on the calendar. This would remind me how much money I was saving"
Smoke them all at once and plug your nose. Can’t smoke when you’re dead!
"When I was quiting, every time things got tough I'd remind myself that there was a time before I started smoking. That remunder helped me keep things in perspective."
"Build on each day. Every day look at how far you've come and build on that. think .. ""Man.. if i have one now i will throw away all the suffering up to this point..."". This helped me through. eventually i didn't want to smoke any longer. "
"What was the turning point for me was just accepting that it was going to be hard and that I would likely feel shit for a period of time. I tend to avoid a lot of things due to anxiety/used cigarettes as an avoidance strategy, so just normalising that helped me to hang in while the worst times passed. It's been a year now but I still have to remind myself during stressful periods."
"CHANTIX
I chain smoked for 40 years.
Got up at night to smoke.
Took Chantix, had no desire, just stopped. Wasn't even hard to do.
It REALLY worked for me."
Start during a vacation if possible.
"Just stop. If you start again, repeat as necessary."
Zyban. It’s magic.
"vape. i quit using those cheapo blu cig-a-likes without even trying. I liked not having to get out of bed to smoke(vape), i think that's what sold me.

now I've got a bigger mod but honestly I feel like I could quit that without much effort, I'm down to 3mg juice.

either way I've saved a ton of money, and I don't hack up a bunch of phlegm every morning anymore. I can't stand the taste or smell of cigs anymore. I used to smoke around 60/day ryo's."
"Collapse a lung, worked for me."
"1. Cut out alcohol completely, and as much caffeine as you can.
2. Keep busy - put off doing all of your chores until you start quitting. You will need to stay as distracted as possible for the first 5 days.
3. When cravings are horrible, count to 100. Nicotine cravings come in waves - they appear quickly and they can disappear quickly as well.
4. Know that you WILL be depressed, possibly very severely. You need to know going in that you cannot trust your emotions during the first week. You will feel awful, you will feel VERY depressed, and it will pass. 
5. Before beginning write down a list of reason you truly want to quit. Keep it with you.
6. The worst of it comes between days 3 thru 5. After day 5 it becomes much easier. By day 14 almost all cravings and symptoms are gone.
7. Care for your quit. Don't get cocky and have a smoke with a drink, don't start vaping, and keep reminding yourself why you quit in the first place. Quitting is very doable; unfortunately, getting hooked again is very easy.

Don't worry about failure, don't beat yourself up if you stumble and fall. Most people take hundreds of tries before doing it, but you can do it."
"What worked for me-- I didn't say alright that's it no more cigs for the rest of my life. In the last two years I have probably smoked three packs. I'm not ever going to quit completely, I will always have a few every once in a while when I'm getting hammered with a bunch of people. But I don't crave them anymore and I used to smoke half a pack a day."
"The night before you plan on quitting, go out, get fucking smashed and smoke loads of cigs. You’ll be so hungover it’ll make at least the first 24 hours easier to go without one because it’ll make you wanna puke. "
I watched my uncle slowly die of lung cancer caused by years of smoking. Not something I would recommend but it got me to quit.
"This may not work for everyone. I quit on my birthday. I had a solid date, and I stuck to it. Cold turkey, never looked back. Just have a date and fucking just do it. This is a bad answer but that's what I did and it worked. "
"Smoke only tips.    

You'll stop soon."
"Vaping. But don't tell the FDA, they'll call bullshit."
"Chantix. Worked like a charm. I smoked for 12 years and was up to two packs a day at my worst.

Also its fucking terrifying and you need people that can support you. "
I fell in love and felt guilty about hiding it the first few months. Quit for a year before telling her. We're now engaged and have been together 4 and a half years! 
Don’t tell anyone. 
"Cannabis. Specifically, out of a ""one-hitter"". "
"My grandma told me ""If you want something, you'd have it by now""

Went cold turkey immediately after that, from nearly a decade of a pack or more a day"
"Buy a decent vape & start with high nicotine juice. Every couple weeks, kick the nicotine level down until you're on 0 for a couple weeks. During this, up your water intake by A LOT. By the time you hit 0 you should have cleared out your sinuses, have your taste and smell back and cigs will seem disgusting to you. At that point you simply put down the vape and concentrate on staying productive. Not being productive, getting stressed out and drinking are what cause a relapse in this. I dunno if that will work for you, but that's how I kicked it and I haven't been smoking for nearly a year. It's so nasty to me now that I had to get rid of some friends who were enablers."
"Just accept the fact that you want to transform into an uptight weirdo for the rest of your life, and then have fun being that. I am an ex-smoker *and* an ex-drinker, and nobody likes me very much anymore but goddammit, I can breathe and exercise and no more hangovers and I have money now!!
Creeeeepy...."
"Well, I will tell you what did it for me. I threw my cigarettes out the window as I followed behind the ambulance that was taking my father to the hospital because he was having a heart attack brought on by smoking 2 packs a day for 40 years. This was followed by watching him as he was bed ridden for two years with emphysema. I do not exaggerate when I say that he sufferers through and struggled for every breath he took during those two years."
"Take champix (Aka chantix in the USA, I think).

It's a pharmaceutical pill that literally stops you smoking,  has a 99.99% success rate, and bears next to no side effects.

Obviously talk to your doctor first, but  this pill being in existence renders all other quitting methods moot: forget gum, patches, vaping (doesn't work anyway, lol), hypnotherapy, self help books, etc. Who needs them when you can just take a pill for a few months and stop smoking forever?

I smoked for over 10 years, between 10 and 20 a day, and I stopped forever within 2 weeks of taking champix. That was 6 years ago and I haven't smoked since. 

Honestly, this pill works so bloody well that there's no excuse for anyone to keep smoking. It's unbelievable to me that it isn't the first thing mentioned on threads like this. "
"Chantix worked for me and I’m going over ten years now. I really wanted to quit. Watching my grandmother’s failing health was my trigger.  Chantix’s side effects suck, and the first two weeks sucks because of the withdrawal.  If you’re going to take Chantix, know what your getting into because the side effects can be discouraging for some.  "
Don’t throw away the smokes. Put them on a shelf so you have to see them every day. Quitting takes will power. If you’re not willing to quit you won’t quit. The feeling of being in control helps. 
"Number 1 - don't quit because people tell you or because ""you should cuz it's bad for you"". You quit, because you want to. For me, morning caughing started to get scary, so I quit cold turkey.
Number 2 - don't ""quit forever"". How about just for a day? If you make it, what's stopping you from doing it 1 more day? Suddenly, it's been a week, you have a streak going, why stop? Aim for another week! Until you realise it - you've been ""streaking"" for a month, you're a fucking boss now!
Number 3- find a substitute- go running, swimming, download Pokemon Go, whatever will keep you busy and engaged.
Number 4 - F the haters and avoid going with pals for ""their"" smoke break. Smoking is usually a social activity, I know, its going to be weird at first and your friends are going to tempt you ""come on, who are you kidding, you've never stopped"". You're gonna think - they're smoking now, I'm so jealous, but, in reality They are going to be the jealous ones, because you're actually trying to better your life, you're stronger, and they are jealous and will want you to join them, so that you can be weak once more, just like them. If you manage to rise above though, you will inspire people to follow your lead, that much I promise you. "
Looked at my wallet realized I would be a lot more well off if I just quit. Healthier as well. I just stopped cold turkey after I did that simple math. There are 0 pros to smoking and too many cons.
"I started using an ecigarette whenever I had the craving, which broke the association between nicotine, smoke and social situations. Before that it had gotten to the point where I'd go to the pub for a few drinks just because then I know I could have a smoke without beating myself up. 

You can get ecigarette liquid of various nicotine percentage so it's easier to then wean yourself off (a process I'm on the way to). Obviously ecigarettes are worse than quitting 100% but this is the only approach I've had that has worked for me so far. Feels good to not have a cold for once "
"In February it's 2 years without smoking.
I got a little cold and decided to not smoke that day. I was always smoking, even if I was sick. I got through the day and thought why not try another one and so on. So I didn't put myself under pressure with the tought of never smoking again. 
I know a lot of people see it different, but it helped me to keep my cigarettes, lighters etc and not throw everything away. If I 'needed' to smoke, I could, but I kept trying not to.
I heard a bunch of people, who quit or tried to, say that they can't have a coffee or a beer as they always combined it with the cigarette. After tried to have a few beers, doing things where I was smoking as soon as possible. This way I got rid of the thought that I need a cigarette while having a beer. 
It's a fight in the beginning, but you get along better day for day. I had a very few days after like the first 3 months and 6 months, where I really wanted to smoke but stay resistant is getting easier.
After 2 months I started with running, doing some sports is helping as well.

I admit I took like maybe 10 shots since I stopped and I don't know why. But I guess that's ok compared to how much I'd have taken if I went on smoking as I did."
"You're going to attempt to get rid of a habit. Figure out a new healthy habits to fill that void with. 

For instance, you used to smoke after a heavy meal? Instead, drink a water every time. No matter what, drink a water after every heavy meal until it becomes a habit. Trick yourself into loving it."
"I read ""The easy to stop smoking"" by Allen Carr. I quit for 10 years now."
Champix. 
"Stop now, stop right away, just give it up. Any amount of planning or ""weaning"" off is going to fail, it's all will power. Also start working out if you don't so your body has an excuse to kick it too. "
"For me it was the patch, breathing exercises, and the Quit Tracker app. It keeps track of time passed, money saved, and life regained. "
"Firstly, you have to really want to quit.  I had tried and failed multiple times before I seriously decided to quit. I decided to quit because smoking was seriously impacting my health. I was falling sick 3 times a month so I decided to quit cold turkey. 
Secondly, you need a strong support system. I had a group of friends who would kept encouraging me and helped me be distracted during my withdrawal. I remember begging my cousin for one drag. She kindly but firmly refused (I’m forever grateful).
Thirdly, you have to accept that it is a process. It’s hard in the beginning but it gets easier over time. I avoided drinking in the first few weeks because I knew it would make me want to smoke. I would also leave an area where there would be smokers around. Gradually it got easier and now I can be around smokers without the urge to smoke.
Fourthly, if you fail, don’t be too harsh on yourself. It’s a difficult to beat an addiction. If you do give in, don’t give up on the process of quitting. Just start over again. What helped me was to keep a count of days I had gone without smoking. Everytime I felt the urge to smoke, I would look at the count and would ask myself if it was worth giving up on the progress I had made.
Lastly, keep yourself distracted. Try working out, reading a book, chewing some gum, watching a movie or just taking a walk when the craving hits.

Remember that it’s not impossible. Just keep at it and eventually it will get better and you won’t feel the dependency of nicotine. "
"For me it was the habits surrounding smoking... Rolling down the window in the car, drinking on patios, etc.

Avoid some of that for a while and it helps."
"Pneumonia - after a week and a half of that I’ve been off for the past 2. years.
Cant tell you where to get it though - it’s seasonal, apparently. "
"I am not kidding you. Getting sick with the flu made me quit. I was confined to my bed for 5 days because of the flu, which once I got over I got a lung infection. #blessed

I've lasted now 14 full days without a smig and I feel great. I even gave my half pack to my buddy because I dont even want one. Maybe its becuase I'm so focused on getting better but, even so. I've already gone 2 weeks without one. Why not quit now right? #weirdbutitworks 

"
"I still take “smoke breaks.” I used to stop and crochet between studying at the times I wanted a cigarette. I don’t need to crochet anymore, but I still do go outside sometimes when I would have smoked. You don’t need a cigarette when you are stressed, you need a break, so take one!"
I used a vape! Vaped for about a year and then quit. Going on 4 years without a cig and 3 without a vape. Don’t crave them or anything. I know there’s not much research about vapes but if it can help me quit overall I think they’re pretty awesome. 
"For me, delaying cigarette breaks. Pur off every cigarette for an extra half hour or something. Eventually, you will half your habit without ever feeling like you are denying yourself something."
"I have been smoke free for 10 years. It took several attempts. The last attempt worked.  First I had contemplated seeing a hypnotist, she explained that she would take me back to the first time I had a cigarette. See the body naturally tells you that this is bad for you, by coughing etc.  But your brain tells your body a different story. For me, smoking was to fit in.  So when I started, I felt good, I was relaxed. I was cool.  So my brain over road my body telling me that this was bad, and said it was good for me.  The hypnotist would reprogram that thought process and my brain would agree with my body and say “this shit ain’t cool!”  
So after visualizing that process it helped to quit.  I never did use the hypnotist. Unless she did it without me even knowing it. Lol. I also did a lot of research, read a lot of books, and the best way for me was to use nicotine gum and lozenges.  I planned a quit date, and worked back from there.  I gradually decreased the level of nicotine till I didn’t need it any more.  I substituted regular gum and hard candy after stopping the nicotine products. 
I also asked myself why I smoked now.  For me it was nerves. I used cigarettes to cope with stress.  So I found a new way to cope. Once I identified my sources of stress, I learned to deal with them differently. It helped that I was also in AA.  So having worked the steps, I applied the steps to cigarettes instead of alcohol. 

So don’t get down if it doesn’t work the first time. Keep trying!!  And it also helps to have a motivating factor.  For me it was my son.  It was cold outside and he was pretending to “smoke” by blowing hot air in the cold. He said “ mommy look, I’m smoking like you”. That fucking broke my heart!  
It also helps to reward yourself with the money saved from not buying cigarettes.  And get something nice. Have a preplanned reward to work towards. When I quit they were still $5 a pack. Lol. But it adds up.  You can start by not smoking in your usual places.  I didn’t smoke inside at the time, so I mostly smoked in my car.  I stopped smoking there first.  Also push yourself to wait longer, and longer, for the next smoke.  Move a muscle, change a thought.  Busy yourself to forget the craving.  And once the physical need passes it’s easier to get over the emotional need.  
Good luck!!"
"Be aware that your fuse for getting pissed off is going to be a lot shorter but remind yourself why and work through it. Also patches, use nicotine patches."
Welbutrin made cigarettes fucking gross to me. I started taking it for depression not realizing that it was commonly prescribed for smoking cessation and gradually they just started being unbearable. Please take little side-effect. 
"Smoked for 25 years. Tried the gum, the patch and Chantix but none of them stuck. Bought myself an ecig 3 years ago, got into it as a bit of a hobby while slowly reducing my nicotine level and finally, about a year and a half ago, gave it up for good. Vapes get a lot flack but I swear by them as a way to stop smoking."
"My last cigarette was July 9th. I decided to quit when there was only one stick left on the pack. I was too lazy to get more. I thought hey maybe I should try, see how I last. Didn't think I'd actually end up quitting. I chewed on nicorette gum for a week. Pretty much chewed it all day, as much as I wanted really. First week was pretty rough. My gf kept me motivated alot. I learned to hate the sticks. For me that was key. As much as I wanted to smoke, I reminded myself why I wanted to quit in the first place. I tried once last year. Lasted a week. This time I was more prepared on what to expect. For me I realised after a meal I'd like to have a smoke. In the morning with my coffee or even when I pooped lol. Anyways pal hope you can quit as well. Even if you break remember to always try again. Good luck."
"I stopped with a group of friends and we had a ""slap bet"" that if we caught anyone smoking, every one of us get to slap that person 3 times within the span of a month, it can be at any time. I quit cold turkey and never looked back. First few days sort of sucked but after that I never thought about cigs again."
Don't smoke at home. Then it gets easier to ween yourself off.
"So.. true story. I literally quit smoking because one day I was so insanely lazy I didn't want to bother going outside to smoke. This continued until gradually, I just stopped. My tip is be really really really lazy."
"Not a smoker , but helped my dad quit at the age of 61. He had been smoking since he was 11. I bought him a vape box mod. I know a lot of people say it makes you vape more than you’d smoke because of ease of use, can use it indoors etc... But the real key was for him to wait until he really couldn’t take the craving anymore then only take one rip of the vape. 6 mg juice , wouldn’t feel like a full cig but would be just enough to kill the craving. The idea is that he was taking in less nicotine with one small vape puff compared to a full cig so over time his cravings became less and less . 6 mg juice turned to 3 mg juice which turned to 0 mg juice which turned to no more using the vape. He was a smoker of 50 years and fully quit nicotine in about 4 months. He wanted to quit which helps obviously but the vapes are really useful if you use as intended. I’m proud of him. "
"You think you smoke because you choose to. You think you’re in control when in fact it’s the altered chemical composition in your brain that makes you think that.

Once I realized that I never trusted the desire to smoke again. It was no longer my desire, it was alien to my brain. I couldn’t possibly accept that. "
"It's a lot like having a bad head cold. It's a constant 24/7 nagging misery, but it gets better with every passing day. Just remember that if you had done this a year ago, you'd be a non smoker and you really wouldn't miss it at all.

Most importantly, don't cheat. Ever. If your brain knows it can trick you into a smoke once, it will keep trying until you give in. "
I smoked for 7 years. I got a new girlfriend (my now wife) and she made me want to quit. I think a lot was I was just ready. If you think you are ready you can do it. I quit cold turkey. Yes it was hard but I got over it and so can you. Mind over matter 
Go cold turkey.  You will likely relapse but each successive attempt gets easier
"So the thing that helped me was recognizing that it's kind of a reward system. Like, ""I ate breakfast, so I get a cigarette""  Once I started identifying the times I was rewarding myself it made it easier to be aware of my tendencies before they happened. 

I also started creating rules,  and if you're tying too quit now it's a good time. I started in early winter

1)  no smoking during daylight. Once you get on with that...
2)  no smoking during daylight,  or on days off. Now you get a day or two of no smoking at all
3)  no daylight,  days off, and not before work. Now you have to learn to start the day without the habit
4) only after work, when being social. Now you can enjoy it casually... if you want. 

It takes patience,  but you can do this. "
"I know that I am late to the party, I used cold turkey and vaping, then accidentally quit vaping."
Try vaping . It worked for me
smoke pot instead.
I had a specific date set to quit (Nov 1st 2009.) Throughout the summer I started tapering down. My intention was to get used to the cravings. By Halloween night that year I was down to one cig per day and I never smoked since (although the cravings never completely went away.)
"Oh yeah, my grandma smoked for a long time then got pneumonia and couldn’t stand the thought of it ever again so there’s that."
Dont fall into temptation. If u have quit for a few days/weeks and u really want one. Just remember how good u feel when u wake up
"Baby Steps, imo

I find exercise helped me a lot. 
I started by going for a walk when I went out for a smoke. Everytime I decided to go outside for a smoke I would walk and smoke. 

Then one day when I felt up for it I just walked. Didn't smoke. Over time I walked more than I smoked and eventually I stopped smoking.

You can then think about going for a run instead of walking if you really want to get in shape."
"I recently quit but to be honest I didn't smoke as much as most smokers because I'd cut down over the years.  But here is what I did to just stop completely. Well, now I vape.  
So I started vaping with a vape pen but didn't like the throat burn that the pg oil gives.  So I started trying the 80% vg which doesn't burn and gives a lot more smoke.  I like more volume.  They say the pen can't do the vg oil but it does fine.  
After doing that a while I met somebody who mixes his own vape oil and liked the stuff he was making so I decided to try making my own.  After a couple of batches I found the mix I like but I stopped putting nicotine in it.  I was vaping nicotine free for about a month when I took a month long trip overseas.  It was great! I found myself perfectly fine without vaping during flights although I still enjoyed it when it was comfortable.  
Now I still vape but I can go hours or even a day or so without doing it because I don't have any nicotine cravings.  But I still vape because I enjoy it and it doesn't stink or give me any physical problems.
People that want to ban vaping can go to hell because it is really helpful in cutting back or quitting smoking."
"Shatter your leg, spend 11 days in the hospital, have the doctor tell you that smoking will give your leg a 50/50 chance of healing properly."
"Spend time around people you like who don't smoke. As you hang out with them more the social pressure decreases. Last cigarette was over 4 years ago, on my first date with my bf. He doesn't smoke and I never feel the need around him."
Stop smoking! 
"One year when the Toronto Raptors got eliminated, I smoked a pack and a half in one night and was sick for a full day. Haven't smoked since. Do that?"
Remove yourself from all the situations you usually smoke in. I went on a weeks fitness holiday where I couldn't smoke. Been off them now for 13 months :)
"I got sick. Just a really bad flu where I was hardly eating or getting out of bed for like 5 days.

When I finally got better and went back to work, I thought ""I have this whole pack of cigarettes, I can't let it go to waste. I'll use this to slowly ween myself off and then quit."" So I went out to have one. It was gross. So I put it out and threw away the whole pack, and made a big proclamation to everyone I know, to hold me accountable."
"I finally quit after moving to altitude (way more out of breath than usual), might not be the most practical solution but it worked for me!"
"I would write on the inner side of the top of the packet ""why?""

It's amazing how infrequently you can actually come up with a legit reason to have a cigarette.  Almost everytime,  I'd just close the pack without smoking.  After a short while, I didn't need to open the pack, I'd just have no good reason  to want to smoke, so I stopped."
If you lapse back into smoking you can quit again. I was a serial quitter till one time I quit and never went back.
"Just don’t lol. I just quit smoking. It was hard to fall asleep, I was cranky, sure I wanted one......the trick is don’t. Smoking is a weakness and it’s a habit and all habits are hard to break. But you do it. Otherwise you’ll probably die lol. I wanted one when I got up......Got in the car......got to work.....came home, when I was bored, when I was with friends......my trick to quitting was not having a cigarette when I wanted one. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Edit: don’t vape or use gum or patches or what have you.....it’s just replacing cigarettes. I promise. You will not die if you don’t have a cigarette. No one ever died from not smoking. Just don’t. "
"Run everywhere. Every time you have to leave the house - jog.  
  
You don't have to run like crazy or like run for exercise every day, but if you have to go to the corner store or something, just jog - it'll prevent you from smoking, get you used to being outside without a cigarette in your hand and the little adrenaline spite will curb the cigarette cravings.....also you'll get places faster."
"Gum instead of the after meal cigarette. Keep in mind that you are CHOOSING to quit, not that you HAVE to quit, being aware that I could choose to go to the store and get smokes if I wanted and I was choosing not to made it a lot easier, I stopped feeling like I was depriving myself. The book Keep Quit by Terry Rustin was a small but mighty help, I don’t think it’s in print anymore but you can probably find it secondhand somewhere (Amazon has it). Lastly, never stop trying. I lost count of how many attempts I made until it finally stuck, now it’s been 13 years smoke free. Good luck!"
"Find something that works for you. I've tried nicotine gum, patches, gum, lollipops, cold turkey, seeds, etc. I know people where medication worked and others where it had no effect. Any person's solution may or may not work for you.

What worked for me was a vape. I started with a pen style and tried to just not reach for a cigarette when I wanted one. It took a few weeks to get used to it and soon I would have a cigarette on my way too work then sometime around dinner - stopped smoking at work.

A couple months and I got down to 2 or 3 a day (from half a pack or so per day for about 25 years). A couple mote months and it was 1, sometimes 2 a day. I just stopped paying attention to it and used the vape to get me through. I switched up to a bigger vape somewhere around the 6 month mark, but around the 8 or 9 month mark I was sitting at my computer one night when it suddenly occurred to me that I hadn't had a cigarette in 3 or 4 days. I really wanted one right then of course and stepped outside to smoke it, but as time went on I wanted one more and more infrequently. Now I haven't had a cigarette in about 7 months or so. I still use the vape and have started cutting back on the nicotine content in my juices."
It’s kind of cheating but vaping got me off cigarettes with no withdrawals. I definitely consume more nicotine in general though.
"before you quit, during those last few days of smoking, don't do anything else while you smoke. don't check your phone, just concentrate on the smoking and you may notice you don't much like it"
"I was smoking multiple packs a week. The damage it did to my body and wallet were becoming more apparent after every binge smoking session. I'm a pretty stressed out person so it was one of the main ways I distracted myself. The $400+ that went to just smomkjg every month and constantly wheezing was a wake up call.

I quit cold Turkey because I knew trying to go slow wouldn't work (I've tried it before). I lessened my oral fixation by replacing cigarettes with gum and lollipops. I also have unfortunately lost my appetite because smoking after a meal was really relaxing for me so I cant really eat a whole meal anymore as it will remind me of smoking. I have also distanced myself from my heavy smoker friends because social expectations are actually quite heavy on the individual and I knew that ""hey just smoke one"" would lead me to smoking a whole pack at a party."
"Just fucking do it. Like stop right now, even if you have half a pack left. It's not worth it. I just quit one day. "
"My advice is to wait for a change in routine. I waited until i got a new job, and used the change in my life to break the cycle! Smoke free for 6 months!"
"Ugh, go out for a bar night. Drink WAYYYYY to much. Smoke 3 packs of cigarettes. 
Wake up, think about your actions and smoke a cigarette. Go vomit and commit to never doing either again. 
Done! 
Supplement cravings with weed!"
"You need to recognize you signs of addiction (fairly easily) but the key for me was learning what type of addiction it is (physical, mental, emotional etc). Now The coping strategy is replacing the addiction with something else. But it has to match. You have a physical addiction? You won’t cut it out by reading a book. You need to take a hot bath or go for a run. Mental addiction? You need to occupy your mind. Learn something or get a hobby, solve some puzzles. This sounds daft at first but in practice it can work. At the age of 24 I had problems with smoking, alcohol drugs gambling and sex. I’ve been 2 years sober from drugs, 1 year sober from alcohol. About 3 months with no smoking and haven’t gambled in 2 years. I’m working on the whole porn/sex thing but hey Rome wasn’t built in a day, right? "
Vape and slowly lower the nicotine over time and replace with cbd then eventually lean off of using it all together
I smoked 2 packs a day for about 5 years and the only way I could fully quit cigarettes was by moving to a device like the juul or ON! Pouch which i was then able to lean off nicotine altogether. 
"I smoked for 8 years, half a pack a day (sometimes more). For me, I got really sick; high fever, bed ridden, cough, etc. I was sick for 2 straight weeks even with meds. I’m sure my frequent smoking contributed to how quickly I could get over an illness. Usually I’m so sick that I don’t even want to smoke so I “quit” for the 2 straight weeks and because of that, i thought to myself, “hmm it’s almost Christmas and I need to save money and I’m already over the week long hump of quitting... well I might as well ride this out.”  It’s been almost a year and I’m finally at the point of feeling grossed out by the smell and the thought of it.  Soooo my advice is to get sick? Idk this isn’t too helpful.... but! Just a tip, don’t believe the motivational speeches saying that you’ll never crave a cigarette after quitting for x amount of time. Everyone’s different. For example, my coworker has quit for 20 years and still craves a cigarette every now and then. I would have dreams of smoking cigarettes again. Be kind to yourself, be forgiving, but be strong <3 

Edit: one last tip! Don’t tell anyone you quit! For the few weeks, I wasn’t sure if I’d stick by it. I also didn’t want the pressure of people congratulating me and then I’d fall off the wagon again and feel ashamed. So I kept it a secret, I only told my SO and a trusted friend. They both helped me stay off the smoking which helped a lot. I could call them at weird hours and tell them to lecture me as to why I shouldn’t pick up a new pack. After about 2 or 3 solid months I was finally confident enough to tell people I officially quit.   "
"At work: Try to avoid thinking about smoking. So don't tell anybody that you quit because they'll constantly ask you how that's going. Try slowing down the world around you as best you can.  

At home: I tried a more in-my-face approach. I left filthy, smelly ashtrays around my house. I've kept an unopened carton of cigarettes (7 yrs. so far) and put all my lighters in a bowl of water. I tell people that I *quit lighting* cigarettes - *quitting smoking* was just a side effect.  

Try to keep your mind occupied (I did puzzles). Try to keep a positive outlook. And take it one day at a time. It gets so much easier after the first four months."
Six years for me. I do use the nicotine lozenges though. They are 4mg of nicotine compared to 14 to 16 mg for a single cigarette. 
"The two top things that helped me the most were:  
Really having a desire to quit. You have to want it.  
When the urge to grab a smoke hits, go brush your teeth."
Stop looking for that one main reason to quit. I spent years waiting for a symbolic boot up my arse to push me to quit and then one day I realised I just didn't have any reason to smoke and a million to quit so signed up for patches and never looked back.  Lots of people say that they'll quit when they turn x years old or if they start dating a nonsmoker etc but they're really just procrastinating.
"Don't fret if you mess up. I dropped heroin and booze easier than nicotine. Meth... not so much, but use it less than I smoke. I can get through weeks without meth, but until recently I couldn't get through a day without a smoke. If you mess up, it's not because you're weak. It's because nicotine is addictive as shit. "
"Went cold turkey 3 years ago. Nothing else ever did it for me. Every time I tried to use nicotine gum or patch or anything like that I’d just end up using a patch and smoking on top of it. Exercise defiantly helps ( I ran a lot), but just stay busy and do anything you can to take your mind off of it.I always had the mindset Every urge i resist  is a battle won. It takes about 2 or 3 weeks to get thru the rough part but you will want one, just out of the blue, for a Long time. I hadn’t touched one for two years and just got a urge a couple weeks ago. I had 2 and threw the rest away, It tasted too good it was scary. I agree with everyone else. Slipping up once isn’t the end of the world,just be fully aware of what happens if one or two becomes, ill just smoke for a couple days. Cigarretes are so addictive it’s crazy."
Stop. It sucks but the only way. One trick i found that helped and worked to this day is repeated remind myself of the gross aspects which creates a revulsion. Even on golf trips with buddies who are social smokers my brain triggers the revolution and I don’t crave it at all. This gross approach is way more effective for me than the health factors because they’re long term where as the gag reflex of “ash tray smell” is easy to conjure up as a trigger to stop me.  Good luck!
"Not me, but I know a guy who said ‘anytime you smoke a cigarette, focus on the taste’"
Just stop buying cigarettes. Thats it. Lmao last time I smoked was 2 years ago 
"This is probably way too late & will get buried, but I took Chantix and my then GF (now wife) texted me naughty pictures to distract me whenever I had a craving. 

I got a hell of a girl. "
You have to actually want to quit. Knowing you should quit isnt enough. 
"Track how many days you have quit and how much money you are saving/ how many cigs you're not smoking. I use an app called cessation nation. Reset it when you smoke. I used nicotine gum and regular gum but try not to trade one vice for another, your jaw will probably get sore from chewing a lot of gum. Do something about your cravings that will keep your mouth/hands busy and be ready to fight those cravings when you know they will be the strongest. Try not to drink alcohol. Don't be afraid to get angry, you're bigger and stronger than a cigarette. Having people to support you is a plus but you can quit on your own. If you fail try again and again until you finally quit for good, never give up. Took me three or four times to quit. Good luck, you can do it."
Remember if you succeed you only have to do it once. If you don't succeed you have to do it again and it is no fun.
"The two cup method, I found it here on reddit, and have been smoke free almost a year. "
Like an old man I had a bag of candy next to me at all times after I quit cold turkey. I bought candy that had a kick  like jolly ranchers and sour patch kids. Anytime I was jonesing for a cig I would have one or hundred. Slowly stopped going for a candy over time. 
"Here’s what I did.

Cut back to 1 or 2 a day for two weeks.

Stopped completely.

Chewed gum.

Yelled at a coworker.

That’s it."
"If it hasnt been said already, Champix really does work. Its side effects are not as scary as some would lead you to believe. Also, you need to want to quit. If you don't want to actually quit, you better find a reason to."
"I recently started smoking again after quitting for 2 years, I know I need to quit but it’s one of the few enjoyable things I have."
"I had to quit drinking as well to do so. Other than that, gum, candy, and A LOT of patience. Cravings made me super agitated and pissy for some time. Just have to walk it off, shrug it off, whatever. I'm roughly three months done and cigarette's are just now starting to smell gross to me. "
"Quitting smoking to me wasn't a long term plan. When I quit, I told myself to worry about the daily craving battles. Forget about going weeks or months without a cigarette. Instead, focus on the craving. Tell yourself that if you say no to the craving it'll be gone in five minutes. There may be days at the beggining where you have to tell yourself no 10 times a day. Eventually though you'll crave them less and less. It may never go away, but you'll learn to manage it. Good luck!! "
Vaping saved me.  Being able to cut the nicotine slowly 
"I had to convince myself I would die soon if I didn't quit. I also kept telling myself that other people were able to function without cigarettes. I quit drinking for awhile, so there were no drunken weak moments. I held a pencil in hand like a cigarette when I drove. No breaks at work. But mostly fear of death. I saw my mom die of lung cancer at 51, and it is NOT pretty."
"I started smoking to help me quit my self harm ‘addiction’. Once that was under control I also wanted to stop smoking, but the hardest thing for me was to accept that when the occasional shitty pangs of depression would hit extra hard and I’d usually either resort to hurting myself or smoking, I would have to smoke to get through the day. It took me a year and a half of not-smoking except a cigarette or two every few months, and that’s okay. Even now I had a smoke a month and a half ago, and that was the first in a year or so. I haven’t had the urge to restart that addiction.
Don’t think you HAVE to quit cold turkey and never touch one again. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you do slip up. Just acknowledge it and keep trucking on. You got this :)"
"Vape

"
"I quit just at random one day, after having tried quitting many times before with planning, so one day instead of buying cigarettes I decided to buy nicotine gums, I powered through the next couple of days with a bit of restless sleep but it got easier after I'd say about a week, then I took up vaping and have never looked back :) that was 2 years ago now!"
"Have specific places in which you feel strong enough not to smoke and expand upon those places as you progress. For example, quit smoking in the car and then quit smoking during the work day a few months later (and so on). Also, take it day-by-day. When you quit-quit, on those bad days say to yourself ""I may have a cigarette tomorrow but I won't today"". When tomorrow comes, tell yourself the same thing until you no longer need to consider it."
"Just *quit*.  There is no fancy tips or tricks to just *quit*.  

Yes, it’s hard.  And those radio commercials that convince you it’s too hard to quit unless you buy their products are just making it more complicated than it is.  All that’s doing is make you think about quitting and smoking and quitting and smoking, it keeps “smoking” at the forefront of your brain.  Just stop smoking.  

Stop buying them.  Stop sitting outside at restaurants.  Stop hanging out outside doing nothing.   Stop hanging out with people who just want to sit around and smoke.  Stop giving yourself opportunities to smoke.

STOP going into convenience stores at gas stations.  You know damn well that there is nothing in there that you need, and you’re just entertaining the idea of buying more smokes.  Don’t even *try* to convince me that you “need” Gatorade or Doritos.  You know what else is in there?  Smokes.  And you know it.  Don’t even set foot in there."
"I quit by transitioning to Vaping.  At first, start Vaping and keep smoking cigarettes.  Yes! Do BOTH!  This will get you used to Vaping as it takes awhile to warm up to it.. a lot of people try Vaping and quit smoking cigarettes right away and their throat isn’t used to doing something like Vaping yet and it feels weird... so the go back to smoking.. but I am 100% serious, do both until you are comfortable with the Vaping and then gradually ween off the cigarettes until you’re just vaping.  I Vaped for a year or two going from 24mg of nicotine down to 1.5 mg.  When I finally started weening myself off of the Vaping the withdrawal is only a tenth or so of what cigarettes were.  It’s way easier to quit Vaping then it is to quit smoking.  "
It's been 4 years. I still get get slight cravings a few times a year. Don't give in.
"Sorry you are going through that, it’s terrible to see what happens to people when they go through it. 

My mom was diagnosed and gone within 30 days. Sucks we had such little time with her in the end, but it always felt better than it getting dragged out for a year and watching it tear her apart slowly. 

"
"I really hope my parents quit smoking. Kids, don't start smoking."
"Stop.  
 
I know this sounds like a sarcastic response, but it worked for me. Just stop. "
"My mom has no choice but to quit when she got a disease that destroyed her lungs. She was told by her doctor she would die if age ever smoked again, that’s how bad her lungs were. Ironically- the lung disease was not related to her smoking at all but that’s a different story.

She and my dad broke it together. I think it helped then both that they were quitting at the same time. They got by by sucking on suckers."
A book called the easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr. Easy read in 08 and got passed around to friends. No one has smoked since. Even a cigar with a little taste of a buzz won’t throw you off from quitting cigarettes. Totally worth the time to read (not much)
"I quit a few weeks ago, and by quit i mean i decided in my head that i would not buy another smoke, not even one. I still have one a day because people are ready to give to me, but i dont buy any and i wont let myself. 

I think its just a matter of deciding you are going to do it regardless of what you go through, and even though i smoke 1 a day, getting to that was one shitty ride. "
I always kept some in the fridge and in my car. Cuz having no cigarettes around always made me want to have one.  My craving disappeared and I replaced it with chewing gum and staying busy.
"Degenerate smoker of 20 years here, 2.5 packs a day. I quit in one try, and I wasn’t even serious about it, just did it on a lark.

Vaping, use the e-cig setup(narrow neck, not fat nozzle for making big clouds) it simulates the hit you get from a cig draw in your throat. Next, get vape juice with nicotine in it. With my habit I started out at 24mg of nicotine, this was way to much, shoulda started at 18mg. I stayed at this level for 4-6 weeks, then stepped it down six mg at a time every 4-6 weeks till I hit zero. Continued for two weeks, then started to leave vape at home, not take it with me to work etc etc until it was just pointless doing it at all, only took three weeks and I gave it all away. 

Cigarette and vape free for three years and a bit. I don’t miss or crave it at all."
Stop It! [stop It!](https://youtu.be/Ow0lr63y4Mw) 
"I had to use a vape to slowly back down on nicotine over a few months. People make fun of them, but it saved me after 7 years of a pack a day. Now I’m off altogether!"
"Realize it's the mental things that are hardest.  Before quitting start delaying one.  Find another way to take a break.  Stop smoking in your spot and make it less comfortable.

Try and figure out why you smoke.  Is it stress or boredom?  And realize it's a process.  Don't let anyone shame you if you slip.  Pick yourself up and do it again.

Finally, you aren't trying to quit.  You quit.  By trying you give yourself an out.  

Remember, every day is easier.  Take the time to realize what is easier or more fun now!"
"I smoked for 17 years - from the age 12 to 29.  I starting dipping skoal about the same time I started smoking.  Any time I had to be inside for a long period of time (such as in college classes), I would dip and just swallow the spit.  Ultimately, I had one habit, an addiction to nicotine, that I was servicing in two different ways.   I had tried to quit cold-turkey many times during those years but never succeeded.  Finally, I became resolute about my intentions to quit.  

I had heard that ""if you quit before you're 30, you won't suffer long-term effects.""  Since my addiction, wasn't as attached to certain body motions - raising my hand to my mouth to take a puff, reaching for a pack of cigarettes in my shirt pocket, etc - I easily convinced myself that all I needed was the nicotine.  Then, I started on the patch - telling myself all along that I was getting my nicotine, despite it being in a different way from dipping and/or smoking.  For about 2-3 days at each transition phase - starting the patch or switching to a lower dose patch - I would feel cravings, but then, they would subside until the next transition.  

I was in graduate school at the time, and I continued to do everything else the same - hanging out with friends, having drinks, not avoiding smokers, and otherwise engaging in my normal routine.  I didn't change my lifestyle to quit smoking because I knew deep down that, if I did change my lifestyle while quitting, as soon as I tried to get back to ""normal"" stuff, I would find myself wanting to smoke a cigarette because somehow it ""went with that activity.""  Finally, I got done with the last step down in the patch regiment, and I continued to go about my life.  I'm now nearly 40 years old, and I've never smoked a cigarette since then - although I have smoked a blunt from time-to-time rolled in a cigar wrap.  I will NEVER smoke again.

I wish everyone the fortitude to succeed in quitting nicotine.  You can do it.  I'm now watching my dad die slowly because of it.  He started when he was 7 years old.  Don't let your (future) kids see you die this way. Please.  "
"I'm not 100% sure because everyone is so god damn different.

Smoked a pack a day for 6 years, and I used a vaporizer to help cut back the cigarettes.

One night I was drinking and playing rainbow six siege in 2016 with my buddies, and ran out of smokes.

Well now I'm drunk, so I can't drive, and I'm enjoying my friends' company, so I just hit my vaporizer 2-3x as much. Woke with a hangover and no longer wanted cigarettes...

My only take away is that if you get a vaporizer to quit smoking cigarettes, hit it a lot. Use it religiously.

Yes I know vaping isn't good because you're still addicted to nicotine, but it was a really big step I didn't even mean to to take"
The hardest part for me was the daily activities associated with smoking. i would always have a cigarette on my way to work and coming home from work and generally any time i drove. so when i was driving was the times i craved it the most because i built that habit of always having a smoke. what helped me was associated something else with the driving like chewing gum or singing along to the music. 
I found that separating the physical and chemical addictions helped. I used the patches and let my body heal from smoking. You get a nasty cough as your lungs heal. Then I tapered down the patches into smaller and smaller surface areas. You can start with the strongest patch and cut it into smaller pieces. Then get the medium patch etc. sipping cold water whenever I had an urge to smoke. helped me.  I smoked for 8 years and quit 20 year ago. 
"Decide to quit, don't tell anyone so it's easier to do it one day at a time. Check out the Alan Carr book The Easy Easy Way to Quit Smoking and just do it!. You'll save a fortune and smell so much better!"
"I think you have to just really truly want to. If there are still parts of you that like the social or whatever aspects it’s gonna be really hard because you’re forcing yourself to quit doing something that A) you’re addicted to and B) you don’t actually WANT to stop doing. Idk, I finally got to a point where I was like, this is gross and a waste of my time and I don’t want to do it anymore. I no longer longed to be a part of the pack of people freezing outside smoking at the pub. So I guess this is shitty advice but I guess I’m trying to say maybe work on your mental psychological attachments and start thinking of yourself as a non smoker and changing your habits and it’ll make getting over the addiction easier"
Quitting for me was really easy with the help of Wellbutrin (which I take for depression) and nicotine gum. When I started taking Wellbutrin cigarettes started tasting really bad and didn’t satisfy me as much. I do crave cigarettes after I eat meals but that’s where the nicotine gum really helps. I also had to quit drinking coffee because every morning I would start my day with a cup of coffee and a cigarette. Now I drink tea for caffeine. I feel so much better not smoking cigarettes! 
"Keep busy. Most people smoke as a habit, so free time seems like the best time for you. 

   Stay busy and keep around places where smoking is either prohibited or frowned upon. "
"I started smoking at 15 and quit at 32. Sometimes I smoked 5 cigarettes a day, sometimes 2 packs.  When I quit, I had no intention of quitting and I have no idea how I did it. I just know that you have to spend a lot of time sitting. I remember feeling like, if I get up, I'm gonna smoke, so I'm just gonna sit here until it passes. I carried a pack of cigarettes around with me for months. I kept a pack of cigarettes in the freezer for over two years. If I thought I couldn't do something without smoking, I just didn't do it.  I seriously stopped doing everything that made me want to smoke and slowly, one at a time, relearned to do those things without smoking. Also, I noticed that I smoked when I was angry, so I had to come up with new ways to handle being angry. Almost 12 years as a non-smoker now and I am super happy about it!"
Move somewhere really cold and only smoke outside. 
"I know it has a stigma but I switched to vaping. I cut down on my nicotine levels over time. I still vape, quitting vaping is a whole new thing to face now, but it's cheaper and I don't feel so out of breath so I'd say it was better than a lateral move at least. "
Keep a written tab on how much you spend monthly on cigarettes. It encouraged me that my money should be spent on better things.
"Get an aspire breeze. Very cheap, lasts long if you take good care of it, and salt nic works wonders for stopping cravings. Just slowly lower the amount of nic over time."
Quit drugs and alcohol first. 
Work for hospice. The number of people I saw who were dying while gasping for air.... not a pretty way to go :(
I quit with Wellbutrin. Let me be very clear. Wellbutrin is not for everyone and I’ve heard a lot of horror stories. It is the only thing that worked for me and I didn’t have any negative side effects. From looking online I’m in the minority. 
Getting pregnant helped me quit the first time. Aside from the obvious baby related issues it made me nauseous so easy to quit. Fell off the wagon several months after baby was born. Quit again when I went on wellbutrin for depression. No cravings and over a decade smoke free now. 
Mini Nicotine Lozenges have changed my LIFE! 10/10
"What helped me the most was: stop drinking and stop hanging around your friends that smoke and drink, at least for awhile. "
Remember what life was like before you started smoking? You coped just fine then without cigarettes and you can now too.
"Here's how I quit my pack-a-day habit: start working in places that allow indoor smoking. This is awesome at first cause you can also smoke inside to your hearts content. But then time goes by... everything reeks of ashtray even more now. You may even been to associate smoking with your drag of a job or maybe even your nasty customers. You start smoking less and less until one day you just quit. No nicotine for 2 months straight. You pick up a vape and now that you've had some time to untrain yourself from cigs, your fine just getting your nic fix from the vape.

**Also**: don't try to quit by just picking up a vape and hoping to taper off cigs, everyone I saw do that just wound up smoking cigs and a vape with no reduction in amount t if cigs they went through. It may have worked for some, but IMHO you should have a gap period if possible. But hey, trust your instincts!"
My dad says try vaping 
"Document that shit. Even if you don't post it to social media, take a video of your ""last cigarette"" and make it the first one of the pack, it'll give you something to be forced to live up to. And don't try to wean yourself off -- just make the decision and do it. For me, I increased my consumption until I was smoking two packs a day, until I was practically sick. And it worked. For me. Maybe weaning works for others."
"Successfully stopped smoking for 4 years after 9 years of heavy smoking.
1. If you can - don’t tell anyone that you decided to stop smoking. This is for “social smokers”. Whenever someone asks you to go smoke a cig just find any excuse to avoid it or still go, but just spend time talking to people and don’t smoke (hardcore level to test yourself).
2. Swap cigarettes to drinking water or eating an apple.
3. Stop buying cigarettes at all. 

P.S. If you smoked for a long period of time you will have the thoughts about smoking till your death, learn to live with it. Don’t judge yourself if you lasted for only a week, proceed with another week of smoking free and try doubling this period, eventually you’ll drop this habit.

What are the benefits? Food tastes better, you don’t spend time on useless thing, you save some money, waking up in the morning feels better, you have a better performance in sex.

Downsides: none."
Chantix with food. Omg with food for gods sake. 
Dont tell people you are quitting. Talking about quitting gives a false sense of achievement that can interfere with long term cessation.
"Smoke joints instead, no seriously."
"First, you have to want to quit.  Second, the physical symptoms of withdrawals last for about 3-4 days, so push hard to get over that plateau.  Whenever you have a physical craving, go exercise, even if it is just a 5 minute walk.  Use some sort of substitute when you are in the car, either gum, hard candy, or sunflower seeds.
After that initial period, the issue becomes breaking the habit.  Do you smoke after you eat?  Pick a new habit afterwards.  
Then you are on cruise control for about 3 weeks.  Around week 3, you will experience really intense cravings again.  This was the hardest part for me.  It is all psychological.  Stick with the new habits you have been forming.
You dont have to tell yourself that you are quitting forever, just that you aren't going to have a cigarette today."
"When i quit smoking i bought a fireaxe and firewood. Cut wood when you want a smoke. Or dig. Either way, youre going outside and accomplishing something, kind of like finishing a ciggy"
Put a cage over your head and give the key to your wife
Ya gotta want it. Once you truly want to quit you will. For some that day never comes. 
You will fail a bunch. Don't be hard on yourself about it. Keep starting again. Forever.
"Understand that your brain is an asshole and will try and use anything to convince you that you need or deserve one more cigarette. Fuck that guy, he is a liar and you can't trust him. Don't give in. It really does get easier. And use aids. Gum, patches, quitline, friends that you can call and freak out on because you just want a damn cigarette. Use these to get you through cravings. It makes a huge difference."
"Biggest is you have to want something more. I also lied to myself. I just said it was temporary, that is be back smoking in a few days then a few weeks then a few months.

Also don't expect the cravings to stop ever. I'm 11 years in and barely go a day without craving one. "
"Don’t try. Do, or don’t. Wanting to is easy. Until you can say, “I will never smoke again”, don’t try. Fill a pack of cigarettes with cut straws and keep it where you normally carry them. Remember, you only have to work at quitting during the 5 minute cravings, which get weaker and less frequent. Remember, nicotine stays in your body ~6 months and slowly leaches out of fat cells. After that, it’s not physical addiction but psychological. The first two weeks are the hardest. Change certain routines up that normally trigger smoking. "
"I used the patch and some candy. The toughest thing for me was not going back when I got drunk. It's never ending though... It has been a long time, but every once in a while the thought of having a cigarette still creeps up on me."
Just go get lost in the woods for 2 weeks with no people joining you. Then when that evil little shithead of a voice makes you angry; your the only one around to be angry with. 
You can always rationalize smoking another cigarette. If you are waiting for an excuse to smoke you will find one.
"just stop smoking eventually you won't need to anymore
"
"A year and a half smoke free. I smoked for over 40 years, so I’m home one evening with a bad case of bronchitis and puffing away and coughing my lungs up when I said to myself, this is fucking crazy. Dropped them right there and then. 

It’s different for everybody, it’s almost like being an alcoholic, you can’t help them til want it. 

My biggest tip is if you don’t want to have a inhaler in your pocket 24/7  or dragging an oxygen bottle around quit ASAP. 

My bank account has grown leaps and bounds since I quit and I only gained 20 pounds. Good luck. "
"Be around non smokers. It becomes a little embarrassing. Even though they aren't judging you, your paranoia about them judging you will make you stop."
"Go find someone with COPD (emphysema and chronic bronchitis) who is stuck to an oxygen bottle 24/7 and can't even walk from the lounge room to the kitchen without being extremely out of breath.  Looking at that scared the HELL out of me. I saw my future right there.
"
"Don't tell people you are quitting, just do it. You're doing this for yourself. "
"Cut down for a few days and then quit -- cold turkey.

No matter what you try -- nicorette, patches, Zyban (Bupropion) or Chantix ( Varenicline Tartrate) -- you are eventually going to have to stop. You might as well stop now as later.

&#x200B;

Know that you only have to tolerate withdrawal for 72 hours (3 days). After that time, your physical need goes away. You will probably always have an emotional need, but you can live with that."
"I smoked a pack a day before I quit.

I went to an Incubus concert where I had front row tickets and an open bar. I chain smoked the whole night and drank my face off like a wedding reception all while screaming along to every song. Next day my throat felt like I’d gargled gravel.

Switched to a vape for a month to help heal my throat. Then went out drinking with a bunch of coworkers. Got dropped off at home, my ride offered me a cig, I smoked two in quick succession.

Threw up a whole bunch. Never wanted to smoke since, stopped vaping too. Friends smoking around me always smells great but i have zero desire to smoke whatsoever. Been three years next week!"
"Spending more time with non smokers and less time with friends that do smoke. I found, in my case anyway, my friends who smoked had plenty of other bad habits, like drinking too much ect., that I shouldn't really surround myself with anyways "
"I quit with vaping however, people who say vaping is cheaper than smoking are only somewhat true ;)"
"It can help to disassociate from the addiction.  its a mental circut, put there by nicotine, that takes over every few hours or whenever, and it only wants nicotine.  Your thoughts are bodily functions, really, and this is one from a parasite.  it takes your money, time and health, but you can starve it out.  

Quitting apps that calculate your savings and show you your streak seem motivating as well.  

Vape shops sell slim pod-like refillable e cigs that cost almost nothing to refill, and have variable ammounts of nicotine are also a great alternative/tool.  I dont like juuls, they seem like a marketing scheme designed to prey on the buying habits of cigerette smokers."

"Not a smoker, but smokeless (Copenhagen), not sure about advice, but I can tell you my quitting experience (I chewed A LOT, for 25 years).
I just quit.  The first week wasn’t  bad, but weeks two through four, I was miserable.  Sleep patterns, metabolism, even joint pain, but I made it.
I, honestly dreamed, regularly, about taking a dip for a year.  Every now and then I still dream about it.  It has been three or four years now, and I have never caved in, but no longer have the cravings, but I still love the smell when someone around me opens a can.
Tobacco is bad shit."
"Chantix. You will hate the taste of cigarettes within two weeks. Some of the side effects can be harrowing, but it’s only temporary and you will guaranteed hate cigarettes if you take them correctly. "
I quit after smoking for a decade by switching to a Juul (e cigarette). Hardest part was not lighting up when I’d have a drink but I just powered through and now I don’t have any urge to pick up a cigarette. 
"Spite. Imagine someone who would love to see you fail and quit out of spite just to rub their face in it. Worked for me. My ex made some comment about how everything in my life seemed to be going better since she walked. ""Let me guess, next you'll quit smoming?"" BOOM! All I needed. Haven't had one since 2007."
I smoked for over 20 years. Here's what did it. Cigarettes have additional addictive chemicals in them that make it even more difficult to stop. I started smoking American spirits. They don't have additional chemicals and are as strong as shit. One cigarette and you don't want another for a while. Thats what helped me eventually quit. I know it sounds wierd to say in order to quit smoking smoke something else. But it worked for me. I was finally able to ween off smoking and I honestly attribute it to not smoking the additional other addictive chemicals.
"Almost no one quits cold turkey and almost no one quits successfully on their first attempt. 

I've had some success with nicotine gum (and no success with patches or pills like Chantix) but vaping was the easiest way to never look back at cigarettes. Get yourself a nice vaping tool and you'll never look back at cigarettes and it's a lot easier to quit vaping than it is smoking (at least for me).

A cheap eCig from the gas station isn't going to be enough. You will likely need to feel like you're smoking which only a powerful battery can provide. You're going to have to spend about $50+ on a nice enough vape but it's a hell of a lot cheaper than cigarettes in the long run. 

A lot of people like Juuls but they weren't powerful enough for me and the cartridges are too small (If you do go the Juul route, be sure to get refillable cartridges, you'll go broke buying the official replacements).

And ignore everyone who says vaping isn't safe. It may not be 100% safe but remember that you're on your way to quitting and they're a hell of a lot nicer to ""smoke"" than cigarettes. I can't stand cigarettes anymore, they're so gross. I smoked cigarettes for 14 years."
"My therapist told me to ask myself the following question when I took out a cigarette, “Why do I want to hurt myself?”  After about a half pack, I stopped smoking. I kept that other half in my glove compartment for months before I chucked it. When I reached for the glove compartment asking the same question, I had an answer, that I wanted to stop hurting myself.   It has been 20 years since I smoked. "
"I likely have the least interesting story. 

Where I live winter is ridiculously cold; None of my friend's want people smoking indoors, and I wasn't going to lower my own property value by smoking in my house either.

A friend let me borrow a Vape, specifically a MVP2 with using a Kangertech tank and sub-ohm coil. I never smoked another cigarette after that first week; I was getting my nic-fix and not smelling like smoke (Though occasionally I smelt of obvious candy flavours)

I bought juice online and, every month or so, I'd juice step down the amount of nic in my juice until I eventually just had flavored air.

Flavored air is infinitely easier to drop than a cigarette.




However: Don't assume that a vaporizer is safe or healthy, assume it's on par with what you were doing and use it as a tool to step down. If you have the willpower, just stop cold. I didn't, and needed a vape. Maybe you won't."
I smoked on and off for 17 years. Like most people I tried to quit many times. I was always able quit for a while but I always went back to smoking. One day I woke up and i spoke like someone had shoved gravel down my throat. Turns out I had developed Polyps on my vocal chords. It took me over a year to get surgery. After that I never lacked the motivation. It's been three years. Never again. 
Chantix.  It works. If you think it won't you probably don't actually want to quit.  Worked twice for me.  First time for a year then bordem in Afghanistan got me  but have not smoked in 5 years. 
"I licked out and switched to an electric cigarette.  Then I got strep. I hadn't used the thing in 10 days so I thought, why go back. I'm at 5 1/2 years and I am so happy I stopped that horrible habit "
Get pregnant.
"First of all actually want to quit.
Then, just stopped smoking the opposite way I started, smoking less and less each day until it faded. Most times I had the urge for 1 minute but I would just stick to it and now I don't have it anymore. 3 years already. Don't avoid the things that get you the most urges (coffee, eating a lot, alcohol, etc) because as soon as you get them again you'll fail miserably."
Keep your hands busy.  I crocheted for 2 months and made a huge blanket.  Will be a 3 year quitter in November.  You can do it!
"I just made it inconvenient to smoke.  I had just gotten a new car so I definitely wasn't smoking in that, and I didn't want to smoke in my apartment either.  So pretty much the only time I could smoke was to go outside and just stand doing nothing but smoking.  Once winter came I was smoking one or maybe two cigarettes a day.  At that point I just quit."
"Read a book called The Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. This is by far the easiest method to quit smoking, you don't have to quit smoking from the get go, you can continue to smoke whilst reading the book, in fact it is encouraged not to stop smoking until you're instructed to in the book and trust me, you'll want to quit before this point. Give the book or go, you have nothing to lose but so much to gain. (Btw I've successfully quit using Allen Carr's methods, I stopped cold turkey and was in a sense, set free. My eating habits are better, I suffer from far less anxiety, my wallet is fuller lol and overall I feel great as cliché as that sounds, could not recommend the book enough)"
"The key to quitting smoking is to decide that you are not a smoker. After that, everything else is just a chemical reaction. Every time you start to get grumpy (or just plain freak out), remind yourself that it's just because you don't smoke anymore. Eventually, you won't have to remind yourself because the reactions won't be there.  


Getting to that point is another matter. For me, the winning strategy was delaying that first cigarette a little but more each day. I realized that I smoked cigarettes based on a fairly consistent schedule that began each day with my first cigarette. So, I started delaying that first cigarette, and the cycle that followed, just a few minutes each day. It got to the point that I was spending more time outside of the cycle than in it. 

&#x200B;

That made the day I decided that I wasn't a smoker much easier."
Honestly. Nicorette gum made it really easy for me. It’s been like 10months for me. And I’m never going back. 
"I've seen a bunch of people on here saying the most important part is actually wanting to quit, I completely agree with that. But for me to quit was all about will power, it was a simple matter of picking a pack as my last one and trying to make it last as long as possible and once I was out, I was out. Not buying more or asking to bum cigarettes off of friends, if I went into a gas station I wouldn't look at the cigarettes or go outside with smokers when I was craving one."
"I vaped like a motherfucker.  Started at strength 12, went down from there."
"Subscribe to r/stopsmoking, download the Smoke Free app, and of course, just stop lighting up. Peace"
20 years and 3 packs a day at my worst. I quit using a method from Dr Oz. Get a stop watch and divide your day into number of smokes. So one pack a day would be one cigarette every fifty minutes or so. Your only allowed to have another cigarette after the stop watch hits 50 minutes. Do that for a week. Then add five minutes to your time. Repeat till your able to just stop. The best part for me with this system was it removed the triggers. It greatly reduced the anxiety over when I could have another cigarette. I could just check my clock and know relief was coming. Hope this helps someone. 
"Get bronchitis for 2 weeks, immediately followed by the flu, immediately followed by bronchitis again. It worked for me..."
Have a kid. My wife wouldn’t let me hold her unless I showered after having a smoke. 
"Quit once for three years, quit again for going on two years now. Tried patch and gum, didn't really work for me. What did was 1) strong pressure from my partner at the time (aka, knowing I would catch shit of I smelled like smokes around my kid), 2) strong disincentive at work (resented it at first, but having to go to the ass end of the building was a pain) and 3) taking meditation breaks, focussing on deep breathing for 5 minutes. This helped manage some of the physical experience of withdrawal, gave me permission to take a moment out when I couldn't focus on work in a moment of brain fogging, it also helped by feeling life affirming. 

Second time, my kid was a big factor. New partner not down with it, so similar incentives. Was able to take up cycling to work, replaced a smoking obsession with a cycling obsession, found that being able to breath was really helpful. 

And practical: first 3 days are the worst for physical dependency. If you can make it past that, the physical discomfort lessens and it's a mental game, but that's a game that you can get better at. 

Good luck, meet you on the other side. "
"Impractical advice... But go to sea on a submarine for two months and don't bring any cigarettes with you.  They taste terrible when you get back in Port.

Course, I had to do that twice to actually quit, but the second time stuck. Haven't smoked since 2006, but I still occasionally dream I had a cigarette yesterday. Wish that would go away. "
"I kept waking up in the middle of the night being unable to breathe. It scared my wife to death. So, I did it for her. Swapped to a vape for 6 months. Finally dropped it. I slip up occasionally. I’ll have a cig after a few beers. But, I haven’t hit the point where I’ve needed to buy a pack. That’s when I know I’m fucked. "
My tip.  Dont have the first one in the morning.  Im 24. smoked for 9 years.  3 weeks cig free. 
"Don't cut down. I tried so many times to just cut down, until there were only 2 or 3 a day... They will become so much harder to shake. For me it was Waking up, after dinner, before bed.

Just go cold turkey. Maybe throw in vaping if you're struggling, but never cut down.

Edit - also the most powerful motivation after you've begun quitting is to remember this. You remember the relaxation or the itch this scratches? It's not doing anything but removing the withdrawal and satisfying a habit. By quitting, you'll stop having an itch you need to scratch at all.

I'm my 4 years being smoke free, one bad day I thought I needed one to relax me. I didn't get half way through before I realised it was making me feel shitter, not better. "
"Cannabis and Kratom both help with withdrawal. In my experience. Not that you can do either, just thought for anyone who can, this might help. 

Kratom tea twice a day was key for me for a while. But I now use it every 6-8 hours for pain. 

Cannabis helped a great deal in concentrated form (pens). Slow deep breaths and it replaced the hobby with something that helped. For most this could mean thc however CBD has helped significantly as well. "
Chantix all the way
"Put as many barriers between you and your cigarettes as possible. Driving was a huge trigger for me, so I kept my cigarettes in the trunk to limit my access. Just like with any addiction, you gotta identify your triggers and be proactive in avoiding/diverting away from them."
"Chantix worked well for me. 
6 years and still no smoking. People say it has bad side effects but I havent had any"
"Figure out if you're a ""I like to have something to with my hands"" person or a ""I like to have something to do with my mouth"" person.  For me, it was a mouth thing.  Chewing altoids all day really helped me get past the cravings of the routine of needing to have something for my mouth to do, which I missed long after the physical cravings for the nicotine went away."
"I stopped caring a lighter and hated asking people for a lighter.

That made me stop.

I only smoke socially now but I never feel the need to smoke or buy a pack. "
Vape
Starting vaping did the trick for me instantly. 
"Get pregnant and then breastfeed for a year and that should get you through the cravings phase 

But seriously kids are the best motivator "
"I quit twice. The first time it was because of a girl that wouldn't date me if I didn't. Getting through the withdrawals was easy but after 3 months of being off of them I started to get wild cravings for weeks every time I saw or smelled a cig. I was smoking again the day that person and I parted ways. Worse too, I was smoking a pack to a pack and a half a day instead of the half a pack a day I was smoking the first go around. I quickly moved from the American spirits I had been used to smoking before to camels, parliments, and benson & hedges. I know other brands aren't technically aren't more addicting than Spirits but it sure felt like they were. If I was out partying with my friends I'd buy like 3 packs and be out of stogs by the morning.

For a long time I was doing that and I didn't even want to quit. Then I bought a 1 ohm vape and started vaping 50 mg salt nic out of it. I have no idea why I did it, I think I had tried a juul while I wasn't smoking at some point and enjoyed it on it's own right and wanted a vape mostly for fun. I did not want to quit or reduce my cig intake. 

Immediately on that day I began smoking half of what I used to without thinking about it. I don't think I even noticed I was smoking less, I remember being confused one day when I woke up and had almost a full pack left from the day before. Salt nic is a different beast than regular eliquid, it actually satisfies the urge to smoke. After a while of doing both I realized I didn't feel like shit if I went for 8 hours without a real stog. And not just not feeling a little less shitty than I would without the vape, I literally wouldn't even notice I wasn't smoking! I kept up buying them for a while because I enjoyed them but after while I got tired of spending the money and suddenly I would go days between packs with out even noticing. When I realized that I just stopped buying them. I probably could have quit the day I bought the vape if my intention was to quit, I don't think I would have even gotten a headache from it if I had. I still love the smell of cigarettes but it no longer makes me feel a burning need for like a week after exposure. I still can't believe that the vape worked so well that it made me quit without wanting to. 

I hope to quit vaping one day, but for now it works for me. My asthma has become manageable, my lung capacity seems to have greatly increased, and it hasn't even been a year since I quit. That's the reason I no longer take one off stogs when I'm offered, my lungs feel like shit for a few days if I take those. If you don't want to quit, pick up a vape for the hell of it and maybe it'll just happen."
I've been off cigarettes for 2 weeks. Getting a vape helped a LOT. 
Chantix.  Done.
"I got hypnotized, it cost me forty bucks and I never looked back. Its been 11 years. I believe I really wanted to quit so my mind allowed me to. It was rather easy frankly but I know everyone is different. good luck. "
"I smoked 30 yrs i was ready to quit, 1 visit to a hypnotist it was over. It's been 10 ago now ."
"Ask yourself if you are a bitch every time you want to smoke.

Does not work if you are a bitch."
"There are a million “ways” out there. It’s really whatever works for you. I had a friend who’s suck on a cinnamon stick, he claimed it satisfied the oral fixation. Others did the patch, or gum, or just sheer epic willpower. One marked a calendar 6months out and said “I can smoke AS MUCH AS I WANT until this date, then never again” was still off it last I checked. Whichever way you go, just keep at it!! Good luck dude."
Vape 
"I don't know what works for you, but here's what worked for me. I had enough with the bad smell, I had enough with feeling short of breath and one day I said no more and that was it. When you realize that you truly are better of without smoking, you understand and agree with yourself, then own up to your resolution and have the conviction to act of your own volition and accord and never smoke another cigarette again. And a day will come when you don't crave it anymore, when you're around it and you won't care. That day might take a while, but when it comes you won't even realize it but on some random afternoon when, looking back, you'll think to yourself ""Hey, it's been quite a while since I used to smoke. Nice."" And that would be it, you will be free from it long after realizing it. "
"Quit several times, but would always go back after a few months. I quit drinking as much and stopped going anywhere I knew there'd be a lot of smokers. It helped a ton. Then, my then-boyfriend(now fiance) told me I wasn't allowed to kiss him if I had smoked, so that was the very end of my ""cheat smokes"". It's been about 6 months and I still crave one now and again after a big meal or more than a couple drinks, but I just have to remind myself it's not worth it.

 I took a drag from someone the day after my friend committed suicide because I thought it would help and it killed my throat and my lungs; not at all the taste or feeling I remembered. You just need to keep yourself away from things that make you crave them and find your motivation for quitting. 

Like others have said, just because you slip up doesn't mean it's the end. It just means you have a chance to start again. "
"Change your habits. Used to going outside for a smoke break? Go outside for a short walk. Or sit inside in your phone. Just change it. 

And don't wean off them. It never works and it's just an excuse. Go full or go home. When you quit it's one or two weeks of hell, random anger, headaches, and cravings, but after the withdrawl abides you should be good. If you get cravings during that time try waiting 20 minutes before giving in. Sometimes you'll just forget you had a craving. Didn't work? Pop a nicotine lozenge into your cheek, but don't overdo them. "
"I was down to one or half of one cigarette a day, and I could not let it go. I worried about weird stuff ""who am I if I don't smoke?"" ""This is such a huge part of me and my personality, what will I do?""
In the end I got pregnant and it make it reallllly easy to put down that one last butt.
I used one of those quit smoking apps that showed me how much more life I had and how much money I saved and that was very helpful."
change your mindset “i am no longer a smoker”
"More of it is in your head than physical.  The craving for a cigarette has been compared to the irritation of a mosquito bite.  Were it really as much stronger as it may seem, you would never be able to sleep.  Mind over matter.  "
Take a mason jar and fill it 2/3 full of water. Then put about half a pack of cigarettes in the jar. Whenever you get a craving just pop open the lid and take a wiff. Sure as fuck worked for me. 
"I took up tea-tree oil toothpicks. Quit pretty painlessly, now I don't even use the toothpicks."
"Get pregnant hahaha, but seriously, that is how I quit. I got pregnant, nursed for 2 years and am pregnant again. I can't stand the smell of smoke now. My hubby started vaping two years ago and it works for him."
"I used to smoke two packs a day and wouldn't start till 2 in the afternoon. I was never addicted, just an ass. Somehow for me, whenever I wanted to quit, no problem. My ex, she couldn't go from one room to another without the cigs, lighter and ashtray. She quit. You have to want to quit, for real."
"It really is a physical addiction.  The best thing you can do is wean yourself off of nicotine.  Get rid of all of your cigarettes and buy a vape.  Get some high nicotine shit.  Enjoy yourself for a few months.  Then reduce your nicotine juice by one level per month until it's 0.  Keep vaping even with 0 nicotine.  One day, you'll realize you forgot your vape and you don't care.  That's what I did, haven't smoked anything in 2.5 years."
Got a vape. Haven't touched them since.
Just don't ever stop trying. I tried to quit dozens of times before I was actually successful. I smoked for about 18 years and I've been a non smoker for 3 years now. Most people won't quit in their first attempt. Understand that most likely you will relapse but keep trying.
"Started vaping about 2 months ago. I use a Juul. Takes some getting used to, but after a week I was already feeling a ton better. After a month, it's like I never even started.

Basically, it's not quitting, but it is better for you and will probably give you some peace of mind, plus make it a little bit easier to get out of the habit forming parts of smoking (such as getting up to smoke outside, or the hand gestures, whatever). Now when I go to smoke, it's maybe 5-6 puffs and then I'm done. Quitting at this point would definitely be a lot easier because I'm no longer going through the motions of smoking like I used to. It's more or less just a little time spent to get what I need and then get back to whatever. When I do decide, it will most likely just be an afterthought."
"How I quit and stayed quit. Hit it cold turkey. No tricks or cheats. Write down all the reasons you can find for quitting and post it somewhere in a space you're in regularly. Get an exercise program - running and kung fu were mine - so you can feel the need for healthy lungs and the damage done. Cut out triggers for a while. Coffee, alcohol, etc. Get rid of anything smoking related from your spaces. Clean out the ash tray in your car. I also used cordyceps, lions mane, and anise tincture to assist but I can't say that will work for everyone. It was an essential piece for me. I've been quit for over 10 years. Things that screwed me up the first two times? Smoking blends, trying gimmicks, and weaning. I am a firm believer that the suffering of quitting cold turkey helps the brain and body develop new patterns of behavior. Be resolute. Do it for your health. Do it for those who care about you. Do it because it's a horrendous waste of resources. "
"Watch this video. I've been smoke free for 2 months now and haven't even wanted one after smoking for 25+ years which also included a chewing tobacco habit.

"Living paycheck to paycheck REALLY helped start me on the journey to quit and after about a month, for me, the urge wasn't as strong anymore. 

"
"I don't recommend it but it worked for me, first get a job in construction, second get tasked with grinding the polymer out of the inside of a manhole cone. Even when wearing the mask it doesn't help completely, and it caused cigarettes to taste disgusting! So bad that as a smoker of 9 years I quit cold Turkey without issue. "
"For me I had to realize that the answer is no 100% of the time. No having one when I’m drinking, or on the weekend. The answer is no, every single time. Once I adopted that policy and stopped trying to justify the occasional one it got easier. You also really start to see the changes in your body in a few weeks. You can smell better, your chest feels lighter, things taste better. You realize that your body is healing. That really kept me from going back. "
Take a two week holiday vacation for quitting. Over eating won't do much(you'll just end up putting on a ton) so don't try killing anxiety with cookies just follow a balanced diet and don't eat anything else. You'll have problems sleeping so hungry ... just sleep whenever you can and wake up whenever you want (that's why the vacation). You may have to quit alcohol for a while because it diminishes your will power so it's harder not to smoke when drunk. Don't stand next to people smoking trying to sniff some smoke just walk away.  After two weeks all the physiological addiction is gone so then you just have to cope with the psychological for a couple of months. Maybe quit coffee cause a lot of people associates it with tobacco and will make you more nervous.
"The only thing that worked for me after 23 years of smoking a pack a day of Marlboro Lights was vaping/ Not in that new cool way but I found a mod and tank that mimicked cigarettes with the right volume of vapor and nicotine to work off cigs slowly and surely I made smoking illegal in my house we had smoked inside for 20 years or so. I have cut down from 18nic to 6 and honestly people make fun of the vaping thing, and I get why, clouds of cotton candy gross, but it has worked the best for me I work in a corporate office and I can go take a few quick hits in the bathroom without anyone noticing and I'm not late for the next boring board meeting. Highly recommend it."
"Just do it, cold turkey, now. You dont need a last cigarette."
"Pick a nicotine replacement and use it until you feel sick. Everytime you want a cig, dope up on nicotine. "
"Might get buried because the thread has been up for a bit, but for me it worked when I had an almost full pack of cigarettes I crushed them up and threw it out. In my mind I would think “wow am I really going to throw out almost an entire pack and waste all that money just to buy more?” Worked for me going cold turkey. Running a bit and seeing the fast improvement helps too."
"What did it for me was the combination of strong motivation and nicotine replacement.  

My then two year old daughter was having frequent ear infections. Her biggest reaction in allergy testing was tobacco.  

The second last time I quit smoking I had horrible withdrawal symptom. Very depressed, lay on the couch not wanting to move.  I knew the next attempt would need nicotine replacement. 

I talked to my family doctor, he prescribed Nicorette gum (It required a prescription back then).  4mg to start, then down to 2 mg a while later.  Part of the trick was to read and follow the instructions. (Chew a piece of gum when you get a craving, slowly at first unless you want a burning sensation down your throat.) 

Don’t be like my brother-in-law who went on the patch then ended up smoking while wearing a patch.  He quit a few years ago, he developed some major health issues that forced him to quit.  

It’s been 28 years since I was a pack a day smoker. I almost never crave a smoke now.  I breath easily, have no cough. I am very infrequently sick with cold or flu.  I don’t smell like stale smoke.  My daughter stopped having frequent ear infections as soon as I quit. "
" Use what is available to you. 

The first time I quit, I quit for like 3 years using a vape pen, slowly weaned myself off that until I used nothing for like a year. After I had my kid my head was all messed up and I went back to smoking... que quitting round 2. 

This time I used the patch and gum and they  really helped with the cravings. I wasn’t one of those people that could just quit cold turkey, and I know it’s hard putting up the 50-80 dollars up for 14 patches and a box of gum, but they work. 

You have to want to quit. Choosing not to smoke is a active choice I have to make every day. 

Best of luck. "
Eat a cigarette every time you smoke one.
Same way to deal with addiction: Get rid of smoking people and smoking places. I started hanging out with recreational runners. You'll soon get tired of the neverending talk about shoes.
"
Don’t fuck around with nicotine gum or patches or anything. The nicotine addiction is still there, just the mode of delivery has changed. Just do it cold turkey. The first few days will probably be pretty nasty but then it’s over. 

Also for anyone that is open to a power greater than themselves and feels utterly powerless over quitting. Just ask that Higher Power to take away the desire to smoke. Just ask for this every day and don’t worry about it after that. If you’re still smoking don’t worry about it just keep asking the Higher Power to remove the desire to smoke each day. Don’t assign a time frame to it or beat yourself up. One day you’ll realize you got through the day without a cigarette (or other nicotine delivery device). The addiction will just have been removed. "
my goals to achive something were bigger then desire to smoke a cig.
Getting pregnant is the only thing that worked for me. I smoked the first few (3?) days after I found out and finished my pack then realized it was making the morning sickness worse. I quit by just not buying another pack and now I'm 23 weeks pregnant with perfectly healthy twins. 
dont smoke
"Ha I was just gonna say that (I don't smoke btw, but I damn sure aint gonna start. Costs too much money anyways)"
"Have you tried not smoking? Did it for me.

&#x200B;

 Actually i used wellabutrin, i just completely lost interest in it and stopped."
"Honestly, just stop smoking. I smoked for 9 years; half a pack to a pack a day. Got tired of feeling like shit and paying for cigarettes. Just stop. Have some will power. It's all mental after a few days. "
"Decide on a quitting time/day you are comfortable with, when you are ready. Commit to it. Then no tobacco of any kind. Use gums, patches whatever but no cheating with a cigarette here or there, or a drag or once a week, nothing. and you'll do it. "
"I smoked for years, but never in my car.  I started dating someone pretty far away and couldn't make the drive without a cigarette, so I started using chewing tobacco instead.  Don't smoke anymore, but now I always have a Snus or some long cut in my lip.  Not sure if this is the advice you're looking for.  "
"I just started slowing down a few at a time, cut the smoke from the car into work out, then shave a break here and there. I went from a pack a day to half a pack in 6 months, then about 2 months later a pack ever 3 or 4 days. The final push for me was getting a 2/3 week chest cold/cough that made smoking miserable and feel like a chore, I was smoking like 3 a day so I was like this is dumb, I'm gonna just stop while I'm this close. That was January 3rd and I haven't smoked since. 
"
"I know everyone else is saying this, but you really do have to just be ready and want to do it for yourself. After a horrible night of binge drinking and chain smoking, I woke up so disgusted with myself that I was just done. I’ve slipped up here and there but no longer have the regular daily cravings. Good luck to you!"
"I (29 M) quit smoking cold turkey two years and four months ago. I was an off and on smoker for about eleven years, mostly on. I wouldn't say I was a particularly heavy smoker, but a pack of American Spirit blues (my preferred brand) would last me maybe a few days - unless I had a night of wild drinking, in which they would go very quickly. I remember the last cigarette I had, and I just simply told myself that it would be my last cigarette. I am not sure I really believed it at the time, but I didn't buy another pack after that, and I just sort of continued to not buy anymore. It was weird - I had many failed previous attempts at quitting, and normally something would come along after a little while and trigger my desire to cave - drinking with friends, a good song, a big exam, a job interview, etc.. or even that good feeling that everything is going well and the weather is wonderful and life is great and a cig would just be icing on the cake... This time I kept reminding myself to be strong. I always knew I never wanted to be someone who smoked forever, and I think I convinced myself that if I didn't succeed this time, then I never would. Also, for personal family reasons, some of this incentive was a bit reactionary. If you care about your reasons strongly enough, then you can quit. I can honestly say that I do not have even the slightest desire to smoke anymore, and even the smell of it bothers me a bit now. I think also after 6 months to a year in, it gets a whole lot easier to remain nicotine free. Best of luck to all quitters!"
I was meaning to do it for a while. I got the flu and could barely breathe. I went outside(in the winter) tot smoke and nearly collapsed after the first drag. Thought that might be a good time to quit. I was passed out in bed for the next few days so I slept through most of the withdrawal.  The week after the hardest thing was not smoking after meals but I figured out that if I snack instead of having meals I don’t get that urge. That was around 8 years ago and I never started back up. I sometimes smoke when I drink but I don’t drink often.
I slowed down how much I was smoking before I finally quit. What helped me to slow down was to switch to a brand that I didn't enjoy so I had to want to smoke really bad before I actually would. 
Late to the party. The thing I found most challenging about quitting was the sensation of inhaling smoke. I found that vaping helped. 0 nicotine worked for me. Ended up quitting vaping after like 9 months. Haven’t had a cigarette since. Good luck!
Cold turkey. It wasn’t easy especially being around a ton of smokers. I waited until it was winter and I got sick though. That helped. 
"I got on birth control, and if I smoked then it would increase chances of blood clot and dying. That was enough for me, especially since the sex was worth it. Even though I’ve had cravings, I think about how many times I tried to quit, and how often I would dream about being where I am right now. "
Get pregnant. 
"I was at 3 packs a day .I stopped completely and never smoked again.
  You have to quit for yourself , nobody else is as important as you
 Take it 1 minute at a time , if you feel the craving , tell yourself that you can wait another minute and stick to it .
  Do not replace smoking with food ,that's even harder to break. Drink water instead. 
  Just just 21 days is all it takes to break a habit or to create one.  

Most importantly, stick to it , your life depends on it.
 "
"You have to become a non-smoker. Your identity is built around smoking....tell me you really liked the taste when you started....you started, most likely, as a teenager, for identity reasons...it was ‘cool’ to smoke. Now you have to cleanse yourself of that identity and create a new one that doesn’t smoke. Not easy-best of luck-hang in there, keep with it!"
Smoke weed instead of cigs 
"I quit smoking after I had pain in my chest when lying down in bed and also realised I could use the money on something more potent than cigarettes.

I mean... Why spend thousands of dollars to something that doesnt even give you anything in return"
"A couple of years before I actually quit, I started telling myself, ""After dd/mm/yyyy, I'll be a nonsmoker.  I can smoke my head off until then but after that I'm not a smoker any more"".  When the day finally arrived, I was ready, nicotine gum etc, I've never looked back."
"Smoked  25-30 a day for about 18 years. Picked up a vape and accidentally quit smoking. Been over a year now. Had single smokes 3 or 4 times and hated every one of them. Just have to make a point of watching the nicotine intake.

"
Sipping water with a little baking soda helps with the nicotine withdrawal. 
"6 years done as of this Christmas...

You've got to REALLY want to do it.

You've got to really want to quit forever.

You've got to be prepared to take the necessary steps (avoiding people, situations and substances that make you want to smoke)

You can't do it half-assed, like allowing smoking on weekends.  All in.

You've got to give your friends/family/significant other warning that you are going to be a total ass and they're going to have to deal with it... but at the same time you can't use quitting as an excuse to be an ass.

You've got to reward yourself from time to time, you'll have some extra money to throw around.  Try to avoid spending it all on food, though.

One more thing, although I had initially intended to quit a couple of weeks later (on my birthday) I caught a bad cold during the holidays and just didn't feel like smoking for about a week.  By the time I started feeling well enough to smoke again, I already had the time in, so I just went with it."
"Accept that it's not going to be easy. On the bright side, you should be over the worst within a week. Distract yourself from cravings by telling yourself you will have a cigarette later -- just not right now. Might help a little."
"Get your tonsils out. When it's too painful for you to take your pain meds, it's much too painful to smoke.

This was, of course, after slowly switching to just vape pens (early style with tiny fluid chambers), extra swelling and issues during recovery from the surgery. 6+ weeks of not wanting anything near my damn mouth that wasn't to keep me alive? I wasn't willing to go back. "
"I quit because I am dead broke now. Couldn't afford a cig so I was like why not just quit then?

For real life advice tho, never accept a fre cig from your friend when you're quitting. For me I only met with my non-smoking friends for a while and it definitely helped. Remember, a real friend would never give you a cig when you tell them you're quitting, only smoking buddies do, and smoking buddies are pretty useless in your life imo.

Another tip I could give you is to also quit drinking. Drinking makes you want a smoke dearly."
"Every night before you go to bed, think of every single cig you had throughout the day and tell yourself ""i did not have to smoke that cigarette."" be sincere, you really did not have to have it. Don't berate yourself, it's not about shaming. Eventually during the day when you go to grab a smoke, it will just click. You will not just say, but realize that you do not have to have it. Giving up smoking is not easy, but this exercise worked for me in giving up a lot of addiction."
Get heartbroken. Didn't even notice I was quitting after 3 weeks. So I just continued a decade now.
"When my wife and I quit, I just didn't buy them.  I just didn't go into gas stations for a while.  I'd get gas and stay outside.  That's what made it so easy.  

Honestly, the easiest way to quit is to actually want to quit and to decide to quit.  "
Chantix.  Don't be a bitch...  Be stronger than the side effects...  Be stronger than the drugs...
Do it for yourself and no one else. Be strong and stick to it no matter what. Find something to replace the cigarette/cigar/etc like a pretzel rod to simulate the motion because it's about breaking that habitual motion as well. Ask friends and co-workers to call you out if you head for a smoke break. Do anything that you think will help you because you know yourself better than anyone else.
"Chantix really works, unless you are in the minority that have bad mental reactions to it. It just completely stops nicotine from activating your addiction response so you just quit because it does nothing for you.

Vaping does work in a strict sense to get you off cigs. Beware though that you really want to stop inhaling stuff into your lungs completely, besides air, not just swap it for something slightly better. "
"Quitting smoking is easy, I've done it a thousand times.  

That's the old joke. But in reality you need to just want to quit.  Not, you want to because you know you should type of thing. You need to want it. That was my major factor when I quit. And when I decided, I just did it. Cold turkey. And it wasn't easy by any means, but just wanting to was enough to get over my obstacles.   

I know, that doesn't sound like help. It is though, and it's the best help I can give.    

But the backup to it is to know your triggers and habits.    

After a meal was huge for me. It was awkward to not smoke after a meal. So that was a challenge, I acknowledged it and knew it would be tough. So I made sure to bed prepared for that moment.   

Driving was another big one. But that wasn't too bad because I could focus on the actual driving.  
Social smoking was really tough. Others are smoking...I smell it, I want it. It's right there. Got to say nope. Hopefully some friends can back you too. 

Visual cues are huge too. I remember being about 3 weeks in and I was watching a movie and the lady was smoking in her car. Oh that made me want a cigarette. Smoking is highly visual so expect some moments like that.  

Stopping smoking is a change. That means you are changing. You aren't just stopping something, you are changing your mentality and physical habits. That's freaking hard. Know that, accept that. You're training yourself to be a new way. Think if it that way to better understand it, and be successful."
Take up vaping :(
I used a website that trackrd your daily progress and told you the health benefits and $ saved
was a pack a day smoker a month and a half ago. would not have made it through the beginning without nicotine patches and regular chewing gum.
"The urge to grab a smoke never goes away completely. After 18 years, I still get the urge every now and then. You just ride through it and the urge goes away. "
Stop buying cigarettes. 
"My gf smoked for years before she met me. When we met she had been cigarette free for about 5 months and she had switched to vaping. Since vaping, she can’t stand cigarettes and is now actually switching to a lower nicotine vape and weening herself off. I’m very proud of her."
"I tried a couple times. Using gum and patches worked for a bit, but I never kicked the nicotine habit. Finally successful just going alone. Not feeding the nicotine breast let to a miserable few days, but after a week or two the craving lessened and I found myself closer to quitting than ever before. I'm three months smoke free, I feel good and smoking is never on my mind. I think going cold turkey broke the habit faster than using replacement therapy."
"I used whole cinnamon sticks to suck/chew on. And when I didn't have one in my mouth, I used a whole clove to roll around in my mouth and eventually chew on and swallow.  The clove kinda had a nice numbing effect.

This works because it keeps the tongue busy. "
"https://whyquit.com

This helped me quit cold turkey 12 years ago. Understanding the stages of withdrawal was helpful too.  The worst was over in 3 or 4 days."
"I identified why I really did it. I knew I didn't like the mouth's taste afterwards and the feeling of clotting my breath.

You know, in this modern life we got satisfaction from very few things, there's not much sense of satiation for anything but basic needs like peeing, eating, sleeping well you know?

So when I smoked I satiated a need, I feel the satisfaction of dropping the anxiety of needing this thing and my day felt much lighter, I also associated it with headspace and an exteriorization of a melancholic image but this was secondary.

 The day I realized I just liked the satiation I cut it off for good. Plus you fucking save sooo much money."
"I went to the dr. If You can afford smokes, you can afford chantix/zyban. 

One month smoke free."
"Here is what worked for me: I did not say to myself that I will never have a cigarette again, ever. I said, I won't smoke one today. The next day, I said the same thing and after a few days, once you established a bit of a track record, you don't want to smoke just so you don't have to start all over again. 

The hardest part for me was about a month in. Stressful things happened and I was dying for a smoke and was having a real fight with myself. Luckily, I did not give in and once I made it through that period, things became a bit easier. 

The thing is, you can't let your guard down. I've been cigarette free for 23 years, but I still crave one, especially when I walk into someone else's smoke cloud. 

Be strong. It's a competition with your weaker self, but that self is a persistent mofo, so you have to be strong. Good luck."
I’m now 2 months without smoking (pack a day for at least 5 years). The thing that did it for me was vaping and decreasing. It’s literally the only thing that worked after countless tries. 
"Start bodybuilding, sick and tired of having bad breath. "
Lozenges 
I couldn't find any tricks to do it for me.  What worked in the end was good old fashioned wanting the fuck out of it.  Went cold turkey one day in 2012 and that was that.
"Change your routine. When I quit, the hardest time for me was in my car. I *always* smoked as I drove. I tried to avoid driving as much as possible for a few weeks. Took rides, kept myself busy. Driving was my trigger and I took steps to avoid it. Find yours, and find how to handle it. "
Vape. Went from smoking to vaping to quitting both because they are both expensive and one is extremely unhealthy. 
"Vaping. I quit once cold turkey, and suffered terrible withdrawal symptoms like insomnia, fever, fatigue, etc. It didn't really last long. One big thing that will help, more than vaping or cold turkey, is your environment. If your friends are all smokers, you're gonna have a hard time. If you're the only smoker in the group, and smoking breaks are nonexistent, it's easier to give them up. "
Cut out alcohol and avoid smokers
"All you need is a good reason that will make you stick to not smoking. For me, the birth of my son is all it took for me to stop cold turkey. Not to say it was easy but i had a great reason to stop. I kept a pack of cigs in the car to show myself that i could always get one if i wanted. Happy to say my reason for quitting was stronger than the urge."
Start Vaping. 
"Try quitting, try again and again and again even if you don’t think you are ready to quit (but want to). Very few people quit successfully the first time. It took me about 6 serious attempts and now it’s been so many years since i’ve smoked that I barely remember being a smoker (feels like that wasn’t me!)."
"It's never just one pull or one smoke while drinking. Those count and your streak of days without should reset to zero.

Keep that in mind and don't cheat. One pull resets your count. "
"Toothpicks helped me realize I wasn't addicted to the nicotine, just the ritual of smoking as well as the oral fixation. 

Also kicking one addiction is easier if you find another, more helpful/less destructive addiction to replace it with. "
"I smoked 1-2 packs per day for about 5 years. I then started rolling my own which instantly cut the habit to about 1/2 a pack a day and saved a ton of money. I continued this for 5 more years then quit cold turkey at the same time I quit drinking and doing hard drugs.

 Not sure how I did it but it was probably easier because I had a real problem with drugs and alcohol to motivate me to just go completely clean.

 After a year I started smoking and drinking again but have only smoked pot a handful of times since then and haven't gone back to hard drugs. Drug and drinking problem in check, I went the next 10 years drinking occasionally and rolling 5-10 cigs per day.

I tried to quit smoking a few times with traditional methods like the patch, gum and lozenges but that only ever lasted a few weeks at most.

I decided to switch to vaping. After about 1 year I had transitioned completely off cigs and was vaping with a high dose of nicotine.  After another year I slowly weened myself off nicotine until I was vaping 0 mg.

Taking out the nicotine completely wasn't easy but the motion of vaping and blowing out massive clouds of vg definitely helped.

For a few more weeks I vaped with 0mg nicotine. I used about 4x as much juice to compensate but it was enough to curb cravings... Mostly. It still sucked.

I then finally decided to stop vaping completely. I had got to the point where I was vaping 100% vegetable glycerin with no nicotine and not even flavoring. I was still addicted to the motions and was really fed up with it beause at this point it seemed really ridiculous because the psychological aspect was so apparent. I finished the last of the pure vg so I wouldn't be tempted and didn't buy more.

It's been about another year now and I haven't vaped or smoked at all and it feels so good to be free of the monkey on my back.

It was still really hard, but vaping and lowering the nicotine dosage over time made it WAY easier than when I tried to quit with traditional methods.

TLDR, Anyone who says vaping isn't a good way to quit smoking doesn't know what the fuck they are talking about.
"
"Have a goal. I gave myself a goal. 21 days. That's how long I needed to break that habit and I took it one day at a time.

Carried LOTS of gum. Lots and lots of gum. Every time I had the urge I would chew. 

It's been 10 years for me now, haven't touched it and don't even crave"
"Take the days one at a time. Focus on not giving in today. I found when i thought about not having a smoke for a couple of days or some lengthy period of time it was daunting and then i would discourage myself. When I focused on today it didnt seem so bad because all i had to do was last the day. Iv been doing that for 6 years now, its been hard  but it does get easier with time. When it gets tough make sure you have a friend or family member to call and just talk too, dont be discouraged or hate yourself if you do give in any progress is progress, throw away all smoking items you own (lighters, ash trays, smokes, etc) and tell yourself that you can do it because you are in control. As crazy as it sounds, for me speaking to myself and telling myself that i can do it was quite helpful, like a mini pep talk. "
If you are at home and you get a powerful craving and you do t think you can get past it instead of getting more cigarettes jump in the shower. By the time you get out the desire should have passed. 
Alot of others have good advice. But one of my main ones is don't drink for a bit when trying to quit. 
"Morning yoga... Last thing you'll want is a cigarette. Wasn't even trying to quit at the time, though I tried many times before. Yoga puts you in a content mood that is nonexistant when trying to quit."
"Step 1 - remove everything that reminds of you smoking
Step 2 - never join a friend that is having a smoke, and move away from their area so you don't smell the deliciousness
Step 3 - I started to chew lots and lots of gum, plus bought an ecigarette
Step 4 - Do some exercise, because I gained a ton of weight in my case"
"I just made myself vape until I enjoyed it more than cigarettes and now I do that. No plans to quit that, though. I dunno if it's the right way to do it, but it worked. You can quit the vaping easier than the smoking if you want to, too. I'm still addicted to nicotine, but overcoming just the obsession with everything else about it was big for me and I'm not dying as quickly anymore. "
"If you vape, throw away your vape. Shit’s expensive yo"
Don't live with people who also smoke. 
"It's all about not buying a pack. I allowed myself to bum cigs until I felt like a mooch. When id walk into the store wanting to buy a pack I would buy candy instead. A lot better for to curb a craving. Plus a treat for staying strong.


Also just remember all the reasons you're quitting. It's worth it "
"if youre quitting because someone else wants you to and you dont...youll fail. 

&#x200B;

Do not try to make too many changes at once. too many people try to do too much, they want to lose weight quit smoking, start running, give up  drinking etc all at the same time, DONT DO THIS.  youre only making your chances worse and your  stress rise, and what happens when we get stressed, yup you guessed it, we smoke.  Ive been  without tobacco for 22 years now  and if i hadnt quit, there is no doubt id be dead."
"1. I had to REALLY want it. 
2. Understand and reduce triggers (car, work breaks, drinking in excess)
3. Restrict places where I smoked to make it harder. (Not in the house, or garage)
4. I used patches for 2-3 weeks
5. I used gum for a month after that

fortunately I sold and purchased a new car right around the time I was trying to quit. Driving was my top trigger.

"I haven't had a cig in 3 weeks.  I'm almost 60.  Chantix worked for me four years ago until I went to the beach with friends who smoked.  Just one cigarette with beers did me in.  At that time, I was a non-smoker when I signed up with my insurance, couldn't get Chantix again.  I may not have been honest with them since then but now I think this will stick...  Juul.  Takes a few days to get use to it and waking up not coughing gives you motivation.  

Try Juul.  It working for me.  You will always want one but this is a great alternative.

I quit drinking for the first month. Everytime I tried quitting before I would cave about 3 drinks in.

"1. Control your hands. It was hard to control the anxiety, but I was determined to be able to
Control my hands, and I wasn’t going to touch a cigarette. As long as I could control my brain and my
Hands, I knew I would be ok.

2. Learn to re-direct your anxiety. Every time I felt like  smoking, I would force myself to go to the gym. Not only I quit but lost a lot of weight that year. 

3. The first 3 months are the hardest. If you can pass that barrier, it gets WAY easier.

"The only thing that’s been keeping me away from cigarettes is my vape. I started at 6 mg and I’m still at 6mg. The nicotine helps with my digestive issues on top of being generally my preferred vice. I had a small pen vape a few years ago and, compared to the setup I have now, I hated it too much to stick with it. All it took was one day forcing myself to only hit the vape and not compare it to cigarettes. It’s not a cigarette. It’s vapor with nicotine and a little bit of throat hit. Which is all I actually needed out of it. Good luck to you 👍🏻"
"**My story:** It took me seven years and five different attempts to quit. The first three times I quit for a few days but easily got back into the habit because it was also a social tool. I made a lot of friends from smoking outside my dorm and taking smoke breaks with a research faculty member while we worked together. This made it super hard to go about living my usual life without smoking. The fourth time I managed to quit for a few months but then the economy went bad, I extended by Ph.D. program by a year and finishing my thesis was nerve wracking. Finally, I moved to a different city, ended up with a pushy primary care physician who got me tested for everything due to my weight and found out I had type-2 diabetes. This triggered something in me. I dropped 60lbs, started walking 5 miles a day, armed myself with the education to battle this condition for the rest of my life and in the middle of this met the missing ingredient - my wife. She was the last bit I needed to succeed. I am not going to say that you need to find the love of your life to make it happen but it helped me get that last 0.01% needed to stay off. 

**The other 99.99% that helped:**

* Make a plan. Set a date.
* Give up a cigarette one puff before you usually would. Couple of days later two, then three.
* Start counting how many puffs you take instead of give up. Stop at half a cigarette. Then go down to a quarter. This helped me not give up or be too hard on myself when I occasionally went down to the filter.
* Augment smoking with a different activity. So walk four blocks before smoking. This helped with the compulsion to get up each hour and go outside when it came time to quit. Also, super healthy.
* When you get close to the big day, make sure you have something else that is big going on. For me it was my girlfriend (now wife) coming to visit me from out of town. I smoked my last one the day before she flew in. Then we spent the weekend together (newly engaged) and it kept my mind off the cigarettes.
* I kept going for my hourly breaks but walked instead, or got coffee, or made a phone call.
* After 2-3 weeks walk up to people you know that smoke. The horrible smell will turn you off so much that you'll never go back.
* Final, piece of advice - don't give up. You can succeed. It might take multiple attempts but it will be worth it.

It's been three+ years since July 19th, 2015. I occasionally get that feeling in my mouth when I think about smoking but I have never actually felt like doing it. Hope this helps you. I am rooting for you!"
"Rationing worked well for me.  Limit to 10/day.  After a few weeks, drop to 9/day, etc.  Within 6 months, you'll be stuck trying to quit just 1 per day."
"My husband and I quit smoking at the same time. We did 3-4 months on nicotine gum and soooo many boxes of hot tamales. We didn't go anywhere that had smoking inside like bars or restaurants and stayed away from friends and family that smoked. I slipped up once and had a cigarette in weakness but it just wasn't the same so I threw the pack away. We've been quit about 12 years now and we're healthy and happy. The hardest part of quitting for me was when I was bored, nervous, or uncomfortable. I used cigarettes to take my mind off things by giving me something to do. I had to find new things to do when situations arose like that. Instead of smoking I'd call friends, chat online, sing out loud (in the car), or when I couldn't do anything else I'd just count in my head picturing the numbers as I said them. I'd ride the craving out and then could get back to normal life. I think it's easier if you can find something to replace them, even if only temporary be it food, entertainment, friends, sleep, or exercise. Anything to get you over that craving. First two weeks are the absolute worse, you think you're dying. The first month or two you're still feeling pretty raw. I'd say once you're past the 6 month mark it's pretty much good as done. "
"I got a vape pen, and used it for about 2 months. You can slowly lower the nicotine level at your own pace while still being able to ""smoke"" something. After using the pen for a couple months it broke, and I took that as a sign to just quit, and now it's been almost 4 years."

"I used an e-cig for about a year, starting with a higher nicotine level and slowly tapering down to 0. I smoked cigarettes during this year too, but attempted to taper back with mixed results. 

Then I moved across the country and was working with a huge group of younger masters degree holding corporate folks, and literally nobody smoked. It was looked at as gross and dumb. I quit cigs and e-cigs instantly simply because of the stigma that I didn’t want to be associated with. "

I got really, really good at Tetris."
I've only been smoking a little over a year now. Only smoke about a pack a week. I plan on getting a juul soon and quitting cigarettes before I do any permanent damage to my body.
"drugs. sweet, sweet drugs. 

people have mentioned Chantix/Champix (Varenicline), I actually wouldn't mess with that stuff - everybody seems to be having the weirdest side effects, up to and including *full blown fucking psychotic breaks

Tabex (Cytisine) works the same way and the worst thing it's going to give you is some cold sweats. it also doesn't cost a kidney and a half, since the whole course lasts 25 days.

also! stuff like this will absolutely erase any nicotine tolerance, so if you ever feel like smoking again, pick something that's akin to fresh mountain air. after I quit, I still did light up recreationally, one or two smokes a week, but anything stronger than a silver Marlboro felt like quickly oncoming nicotine poisoning.

Get a prescription for Chantix. I stopped halfway through a cig about 2 days into it. Haven't even taken a cheat puff since then. In fact cig smoke repulses me anymore and it's been almost 10 years.
"1.Throw out all your smoking paraphernalia: lighters, ashtrays, coupons for cigarettes, etc AND all of your cigarettes.   All of it. In the trash. Bury it so you can't get it back.  Bury it deep. Now pour water and week old Chinese food all over it so it's ruined.

2.  Figure out your triggers (what makes you crave a cigarette). Food, alcohol, stress, parties, driving, coffee, sex, a certain place, etc.  Now, you may have to stop or limit that thing (or your exposure to it) until you can re-learn to do it (have a beer, drive to work, hang with certain people) without smoking.  This could take a while.  But the point is to not have any activities in your life that make you want to smoke.

3.  Figure out how much you spend on smokes a week. Now keep track of how much you will be saving by not smoking.  Decide on a prize for yourself you can only save up for and buy from not smoking for a while. E.g. a PS4 Pro is ~$400.  $6 a pack x 2 packs a week = 34 weeks of not smoking.  That means in 8 months or so, you can get a PS4.  YMMV depending on how much cigarettes cost by you or how often you smoked, but you get the point.

"It's been 27 years, but i remember I wrote down why I wanted to quit (health, $, smelliness/hygiene, wanting to be a good role model to my newborn son) and kept that list with me in my wallet to look at it. I also set a date for quitting - and told people. Chewed gum. Toughed it out the first week and knew it was all in my head after that! 
Edit:  writing this makes me kind of want a smoke - but I won't. Quitting is a bitch. "
"Smoke free 23 years. These things helped me:

1. Throw away all your lighters and ashtrays.
2. Clean out any place (car, bedroom, kitchen) immaculately if that is a place you like to smoke. Scent it with a smell you like a lot.
3. Keep every minute of your day as busy as possible for the first two weeks. Daylight to dark, have something going on.
4. Do anything to occupy your hands and mouth. Drink lots of sparkling water or anything with a heavy mouth feel. Chew Gum- Eat extra if you don't think it will make you put on weight or have lots of low calorie snacks like vegetables.
5. Realize after two weeks you are well past the withdrawal phase. It is now about psychological dependence and socialization opportunities smoking affords. Toward that end, I steered clear of smokers for the first year or so.

Good luck! I am so exceedingly glad I had the chance to quit. I am certain I would have been dead had I continued."
"DO]on't buy the bullshit, go cold turkey. The nic replacements:gum, ecigs, etc. are just an invitation to go back and end up stringing you out. Be done. Quit. End the fucking chapter.  "

You know that craving you get due the taste in your mouth (like after a coffee). Used to pop one in and the feeling to light one up was gone. I think mostly because my mouth had that strong flavour that *I knew* it would clash with a cigarette. It helped during long hours of work. Helped when I decided to quit. Which by the way I did cold turkey. Quit after 13 years in a day. That was 10 years ago. Still kind of proud of myself with that :)

Edit: I should add, that I don't mean a menthol/eucalyptus candy will do miracles and make you stop smoking. But in my case, it helped a lot. *Really wanting* to quit is paramount."
"Wash all your fabrics multiple times and fabreeze what you can’t wash. That should be done for days and days and days. I was lucky enough that when I quit I had great support from my family and my mom was the one that told me to gather up everything to be washed. Also keep the fabrics outside until that whole process is complete. 
Understand that by quitting you are picking a fight with your brain that will last about 2 weeks and it will be a hard 2 weeks. You will go from happy to rage in no time flat and it will be for the dumbest stuff. 
In the beginning you will need to try to avoid smoking situations like beer and a smoke or coffee and a smoke. But you’ll do it and be fine eventually. And most importantly Good Luck!!"
I quit smoking because I really wanted to have a baby. I quit cold turkey and my husband helped me through cravings for the first week ish. We went out for milkshakes A LOT that week. But after about 4 days it got a lot easier and god it's amazing not smelling like stale cigarettes. 
Alan Carr 
"Don’t try to cut down, it doesn’t work. If you cut down then each cigarette becomes more rewarding, you enjoy them more, you forget how disgusting they are. It’s almost best to smoke double right before you quit so your last memory of smoking is the disgusting effects it has on your body. Also, use the patch to get through the physical withdrawal, but remember that the patch doesn’t help with mental addiction. It’s a tool, not a magic bullet. Finally, exercise. "
"Going to the gym, doing cardio did help me a lot. The more stress I put on my lungs ,more I realised the damage of years of smoking."
"I quit when i was younger, smoked for about 6 years.

First, I really got into working out and smoking made me feel really bad. So that helped.

But mainly I am a cheap ass. I bought a pack for 7 bucks one day and as I was smoking the first one I felt bad and so I threw the whole pack out the window. To this day, almost a decade later, I cant justify buying another one.

I smoked before the FSC ""Fire Safety Control"" laws added basically glue rings to the cigarette every couple cm that made it smoke evenly and quit burning when you didnt inhale for a moment. Once they added that I started getting sick and quit. That was a huge point for me.

Edit: Forgot, I smoked weed also. Whenever I wanted a cigarette I would have a joint or smoke a bowl. Really helped me quit. Weird.

Also a lot of people are using psilocybin or LSD or other drugs to quit and it seems to work wonders. Look into it."
Champex
Just cold turkey it bro best way. Just stop and never do it again. It’s that easy. Don’t waste your money on all the crutches they sell. Just do it!
"In the first few days of quitting a large percentage of your cravings are related to a sugar withdrawl and not necessarily a nicotine withdrawl. This is from not having your blood sugar spiked by cigarettes like you are used to, this is the reason smokers can get diabetes. Support yourself by eating sugar or drink juice when you are feeling the urge to smoke. This should primarily be done within the first week or so. I by no means recommend replacing cigarettes with sugar. Nicotine withdrawl is hard enough, sugar withdrawl on top of that makes it easy to cave. 
"
"I use to smoke a pack a day and I tried a couple of times. In the end I really wanted to quit, it’s expensive, I’m fit and it contradicted that part of my life and also my old workplace which was so even unintentionally pro smokers changed rapidly to no smoke so I had a lot of motivation. 

I did Champix for the second time, got an extension from the GP. I also tried to chew a lot of chewy just flavoured nothing special that’s what got me through the worst, initial six weeks. 

but probably the best advice I’d give to someone because it works for me is don’t have an all or nothing approach, if you’ve gone cold turkey for a month and you have a couple smokes that doesn’t erase all the work you’ve done. Just take it day by day and don’t smoke most days."
"Set a date that's not New Years day and stick to it. From that date forward, you will not have any cigarettes, period. Don't smoke any just for fun when you are at a party or having a drink with co-workers. Don't substitute smoking for any other kind of nicotine replacement like vaping or gum. Be aware of everything that will get you sucked back into the habit and just quit cold turkey. 

A big motivator for me was money. It also helped me that I was in college when I quit and I was broke. Think about the money you'll save. Buy yourself something after you reach a goal. "
You have to want to quit or else you will fail every time. At least that was my case
My parents switched to vaping and gradually decreased the nicotine in their juice.
"Find something else to do to occupy yourself, and a healthy snack to have instead of a cigarette. I hate having idle hands, and this is the biggest issue I have when I quit smoking. Going on walks helped too. Whenever I craved one, I’d go for a walk. Not the same, but pleasant at least. "
Zyban did it for me 
I would sit down in the shower and have the water extremely hot. It simulated the warm relief a cig would provide. It’s not easy but you can quit. You don’t need cigarettes...it’s not food or water. Just quit. 
"I knew I wanted to quit but wasn't there just yet. So I set goals. First, stopped smoking in my apartment. Next my car. Then stopped smoking after every meal. After 2-3 months of successfully doing those I started seeing how long I could go between smokes. After a few weeks of only smoking 2-3 times I decided it was time. So I switched to crack. Been smoke free for 10 years now. "
"you can go see your doctor and ask for champix to see if its legal in your country, its a medication that will cut the connection between your brain and the nicotine, to be honest i dont know the real science behind it but it does totally work. it will give you side effect at nigh like dehisydratation,nightmare, you need to keep smoking while taking the meds and after a day or 2 you wont event finish your smoke, after a week you wont event be smoking anymore because you wil feel sick and want to puke, and the day you will puke because you WILL, is the day you will stop smoking BUT keep taking the meds for the entire duration"
Salt nic vapes. Never smoked again.
"I have lots of advice about this. It took me seven tries to quit, but it got easier every time, and the last time was very easy, because I paid attention and learned from each failure. My logic was that there's probably many right things to do, but only a limited number of wrong ones, and so I tried to identify and eliminate the mistakes and focused only on that. I figured that I'd eventually run out of mistakes.

**Understand what smoking addiction is, so you know what you're dealing with.**

Smoking is most commonly regarded as a chemical addiction to nicotine. And it is, in part, and that part is powerful. BUT: Nicotine is a 'resident' addiction, meaning that you only experience withdrawal symptoms while the agent is in your system. When it's gone, you no longer have those symptoms. The level of nicotine in your system drops more or less geometrically: In the first few days, levels drop a great deal. After about a week, you're half clean. Another week or so, you're down to about a quarter. It takes about a month before levels drop to the point where they no longer have any effect. The symptoms of chemical withdrawal are about as strong as the levels. So it's bad the first week, then easier after that.

Unfortunately, smoking is much more than a chemical addiction. It's a **habit**. And habits can be harder to deal with than chemical addiction.

**You cannot ""break"" a habit. You can only let it atrophy, or replace it with a** ***contradictory*** **habit.**

Okay, technically, you **can** break a habit, but you wouldn't want to. A 'habit' is anything that you're so familiar with, you can do it without thinking, and feel an urge to do it. Many people report 'zoning out' on their commute and not remembering it. That's because if you drive the same route enough, your brain hardwires it so that you don't need to consciously think about it any more. Smoking is like that. It's hardwired into your brain. So you **can** 'break' a habit, but pretty much only in ways that are bad for your brain.

A habit atrophies if it goes unused long enough. Many habits are just muscle memory, and it could take decades for them to atrophy, which is why you don't forget how to ride a bike. If you wait long enough, the smoking habit will atrophy, too, but you might not have that long, and you might not be able to hold out that long.

But a habit atrophies much faster if you actively develop a **contradictory** habit. To successfully quit smoking, you need to actively replace the habit of smoking with a new habit of **not** smoking. Here's how you do that.

Smoking always takes place in some context, and most smokers have preferred times for smoking, as well as times they're less prone to smoke. These contexts become triggers telling you when to smoke. Identify them, and then deliberately deprive yourself at those times, to more rapidly erode your brain's association, reducing their effectiveness as triggers.

If you're like I was, you might be lucky enough to also have the opposite, times and situations when you **don't** like to smoke, when you don't find it enjoyable or it creates some kind of unpleasantness. If you do, then **do** smoke at those times. That has the effect of creating negative association with smoking, so that it's less desirable overall.

**If you can, quit cold turkey.**

Not everyone can do this, and don't feel bad if you can't. Everyone's different. If gum or some other device helps, use it. But if you can, quitting cold can help you quit faster, by getting the addictive chemical out of your system sooner.

If you're following a programme, then follow those instructions. Otherwise, follow a plan of gradual reduction, and slow the rate as you go to make it easier. This can be open-ended, so long as it eventually ends with zero.

**Forgive yourself if you fall off the wagon.**

It's extremely common to fail the first time, or even many times. You must forgive yourself. Beating yourself up over it only creates a negative association with quitting, which is the opposite of what you want. Just shrug it off and forget about it. Let each new time be a fresh new 'first' time.

**Don't pick an arbitrary time or date.**

Many failed quitters stopped smoking on New Year's Day. It's a very common and popular New Year's resolution. But it's not usually a good day for most people. Human lives are complicated. You must be ready when you try to quit, and if you don't feel ready, then you're not. If you've got shit going on that's causing you stress, wait till you're past that. Trying to quit when you've got other things causing you stress will just make it that much harder. Not impossible, but harder. If you can pick a time that's easier, do it.

**Stop cleaning your ashtray.**

Let the butts pile up. They're disgusting to look at, and that will provide negative association with the habit. Some people have found it helpful to dump the butts into a jar of water, and every now and then take a whiff. It's really disgusting.

Meanwhile, clean up everything else. Let everything that you **don't** associate with smoking be clean and inviting.

**Avoid social triggers.**

Quitting is made harder by the social triggers that you associate with smoking. Friends who smoke, places you like to smoke, that sort of thing. You may not be able to avoid all these activities and places for a whole month or two, but avoid them as much as you can.

**Once you're clean and no longer feel anxious, gradually reintroduce yourself to smoking triggers.**

It does little good to quit if you can't re-enter the smoking world without losing control. So while avoiding triggers while you're quitting is helpful, you also need to learn how to be around those same triggers without smoking, and be comfortable with them. Do this gradually, over a period of months.

**Be wary of replacement habits.**

Your brain will try to get you to pick up something else. Eating is a common one. Be consciously aware of urges like that. When you're feeling weak, drink water and do something physical to burn off the anxiety until you can sleep.

**You will cough. A lot.**

One of the counter-intuitive things about smoking is that when you quit, you start coughing more. Smoking knocks down the cilia in your lungs whose job it is to lift foreign matter out. That action causes coughing. So perhaps ironically, smoking can reduce coughing, by suppressing your lungs' natural self-cleaning mechanism.

Once you quit, the cilia start to work again, and they start working to clear your lungs. That will cause you to cough, and you will probably cough a lot more than usual for the month or two that you're quitting.

**Don't go halfway.**

If you were in the habit of smoking in the car, your car is now a No Smoking area -- for you and everyone else. Get in there on a sunny day when you can roll the windows down and air it out all day. Use a grease-cutting glass cleaner and lots of rags to clean all the creosote off of every hard surface. Use spray-and-vac to clean the upholstery, and minty alcohol to get the smell out of the carpets. Get an air freshener and use it for several months. Air the car out at every opportunity for the next several months. If you can afford it, have it professionally detailed.

Same for every part of your dwelling that you can get at and clean. This could take a year, but it's worth it.

Don't let anyone else smoke in these places. No exceptions, unless it's some really serious drama of some kind.

**Don't lord it over other people.**

Quitting is really, really hard, and some people never succeed at it. Don't ever make anyone feel bad about it, and using yourself as an example counts.

**DO offer other people positive and useful advice, if you can.**

I have heard so many stories of people who quit smoking for years and then started smoking again because they decided to smoke while they were fishing, drinking, playing golf, etc.
 
Also I don’t think this would work for everyone but for me I kind of tried to embrace the cravings.  THEY WILL PASS.

I smoked for 15 years and tried to quit many times and ultimately it was my health that got me to quit. I started having breathing problems.  I have quit since 2011. I also no longer get the once  a year bronchitis I used to get when I smoked .

"I used an app on my phone and just dealt with it. I kept a “safety” pack just to be safe, because if I got in a car wreck or found out something terrible I would have to have a smoke. After about three-four weeks of not smoking I went to a bar and tried one of my safety cigarettes. It was disgusting! Never smoked again. 

The app was called iQuit I think. I smoked for 7 years and it really helped me out."
"Nicotine replacement was key for me.  The gum was not enough nicotine.  The patch worked well, but every once in a while part of it would come off, and I'd get shaky and terrible -- then a piece of gum to supplement worked miracles.  

Then the next trick to learn was that the patch actually made me fucking crazy -- after a few weeks at the same dose.  It got to the point where I could just cry for hours and hours and never feel better.  Out of sheer desperation, I took the patch I had and cut about 25% of it off (this decreases the dose by 25%) and that did the trick.  I wound up having to whittle down my patch sizes sort of every other day in order to stop the desperate crazy weeping, and stopped completely after doing like 3 mg/day for a couple of days.  

The other thing I had to learn was that I had generalized anxiety, and I had been using nicotine to treat my panic attacks, anger attacks and anxiety.  So I had to switch to zoloft, then lexapro, then klonopin, then nothing after about 10 years.  Still healthier than smoking.  

Last thing: in addition to nicotine preventing me from falling into a pit of anxiety, it actually also prevented me from feeling happy.  About 4 or 5 days after my last nicotine replacement dose, I could listen to something that someone said that was emotionally significant and actually feel something besides mild intellectual annoyance.

If you do it for reasons you don't really care about it won't work. Because there is no easy way to quit smoking. 10 years later I still get the occasionnal craving.

&#x200B;

Aside form that, chew normal gum to help with the oral fixation and find something to fidle with to occupy your hands. but those 2 tricks won't work if you quit half-ass."
"Hi there! I really wanna share my story since it is so recent! I quit smoking Almost 45 days ago, I've tried countless times beforehand. I smoked for over 10 years, pack a day, I honestly read 3/4 of the way through how to quit smoking the easy way by Allen Carr and kept a few of the brilliant things I read in the book in mind and would think about the feelings of a craving before the cigarette my thought process while smoking the cigarette and how I felt after, about a week later, when I decided to, I went cold turkey. I of course think about buying a pack, but I got what I wanted. Freedom from paying out the nose for lung cancer that I would have enevitably got. But you have to want it, there is no one better at lying to you than yourself.

Edit: grammer"
"You got to want to do it.   


Don't substitute another bad habit. Vaping, candy, chew, pop, etc... The best luck i had was every time I had the urge to smoke i picked up a straw and twiddled it with my fingers for a while and maybe chewed on it if i needed the oral fixation. "
"The Quitnow! App worked for me. Once I made it to like 3 weeks I'd open my phone every morning and see ""21 days..."" and I'd just be like... fuck, I don't wanna start over. 1,488 days later, number still getting bigger."
"Juul, bruhhh"
"First: you have to want to quit. That's not the same thing as knowing that you need to quit.

Second: Take Chantix. Don't listen to all the people crying about the nightmares.

Third: get ready for the nightmares. I had the most vivid horrifying nightmares of my life. Absolutely the most terrifying dreams I've ever had. Night after night for about a week, starting day 5 or so.

Fourth: be amazed at how well Chantix works at making you not feel the need for a smoke. You will be tempted to smoke, but all you have to do is tell yourself no, and the urge will pass quickly.

Fifth: take it for the whole 12 weeks (or whatever it is). Do not think about the cost (about the same as 2 packs a day ish) because you woulda spent the money on smokes anyway.

Final: be amazed at how much better you feel, even after 2 weeks without a smoke. I'm 18 months in and I feel 10 years younger.

You can do it. The nightmares are either free entertainment, or an excuse for someone who doesn't really want to quit.

Oh, and the nightmares will scare the shit outta you."
"A couple of things helped me kick the habit. 

- The first was understanding that my addiction was more habit and routine rather than nicotine itself. So I narrowed down where/when I smoked the most (which was at work for me), and eliminated smoking at home.

- I used to chain smoke 3-4 cigarettes during my breaks so, so the second thing was eventually working my way down to 3 ciggs a day. 

By far the hardest part of quitting was the social aspect, especially when you're drinking. This lingered for a few months and eventually turned into a very seldom activity until I never did it again.

Best advice I ever received: Never quit quitting! 

"
I joined /r/stopsmoking and I read Allen Carr's Easy Way to stop smoking.  Both things helped me immensely.
"Apart of really resolving to quit, I also realized that the urge to smoke was very momentary. If I thought about something else for a few minutes the urge usually went away. I pretty much learnt to distract myself with something else for the time being and got through the day. The toughest part was resisting the urge to reward myself with just one cigarette for having won the day or saying that I’ll just have one in the morning because I’m not smoking for the rest of the day.  That just took sheer willpower. "
"It sucks.

Sometimes I miss it.

You can do it... but it sucks."
"Much as the top comment from u/4Gotten1 says, you have to actually want to quit or, as it is in my mind, you have to actually decide to do it. There can't be any waffling or uncertainty. If you truly want to quit, you can just make up your mind to do it. I ""quit"" so many times but really, I knew I wasn't actually. I'd go a week and then go buy a pack because I wanted to. I fully owned and acknowledged that I was making the decision to buy it and smoke it.

When I finally truly quit, I had full peace of mind knowing I wasn't going to go buy them. Sure, I had and still do have cravings. I want a cigarette pretty much every waking moment of the day. However, I know I'll never go and buy a pack. I just won't. It's hard to explain but... yeah... you just have to decide not to do it. Nothing makes you smoke another one and break it. There's no magic in the world that wills you to do it outside of your own control. I think once you acknowledge that, it helps. It isn't a lack of self control, you just thought about it and made the decision to smoke it. It didn't just happen on it's own, out of your control. Once you get there, I think the quitting is easy. It was for me. I know it sounds kinda Zen and hokey but yeah, I really believe in it. Smoked for 10 years. Quit 7 years ago. Haven't smoked a single one since.

If you ever want what I call an ""accountabilabuddy"", just PM me."
"I think one of the biggest takeaways here is that everyone is different.

With that being said, I always had trouble breathing through my nose, so I usually didn't smoke when I was sick because I don't couldn't breathe.  Once I was ready to quit (the 7th time) I just didn't start up again after being sick for a week. Being sick and feeling like crap masked the initial withdrawal symptoms, so I only had to deal with the mental part.

The other thing that really helped *me* was I would ***chug*** soda water when I had a craving. Not soda, but just soda water.  The fizz and slight irritating of my throat really helped that craving/anxiety pass."
"My husband quit because he got sick enough to spend 3 days in bed shy of bathroom breaks, didn't even eat, just drank apple juice. He'd never been able to go 3 days previously so he decided to take advantage and not start again. I decided if he could quit so could I, I was sick for weeks but was too stubborn to give in because my husband did it (I may have issues with competitiveness). I refuse to go through that hell again so I won't ever have another (felt safe claiming that after the first 10 yrs, been over 20 now). "
"Change your routine, use some e-cigarettes with low nicotine to help with the cravings and help with the habit of smoking. "
"Make it inconvenient to smoke. Throw away your cigarettes. Really really want one? Fine. But a pack. Smoke one or two. Throw the rest away. Keep doing that whenever you want one. Eventually it becomes if you want a cigarette, you have to spend $5-10 (depending on your location) and go out to the store just for a smoke or two. 

Eventually you’ll get a craving and thing “eh, not worth it.”"
"Make yourself sick. You think a hangover is bad? Trying having too many cigarettes. It's stronger than food aversion. The mere thought of a cigarette will make you sick. The smell on someone else, you've just vomited a little in your mouth.

I used to smoke a pack a day. Quit multiple times. Haven't touched a cigarette in 5 years. Even seeing a pack makes me queasy."
Just fucking do it!
"Cigarettes I had to try quitting multiple times. According to the high schoolers I worked with at the time, I was a bitch during. I felt like I needed to rip my tongue out. Finally went to Target and got a generic nicotine gum. No problems. 


Weed, was easier. My phone broke. I could not fix it. I had just moved and no one knew where I moved. I figured it was the best chance I'd have to quit. Still haven't gone back. A year later, I have a government job. Semi worth it."
"The only thing that helped me quit was running. Every time I craved a cigarette I would go for a run, even if it was 2am. It actually worked- it made me feel great knowing my lungs were getting back on track, and it ran out all of that extra anxious energy. "
"It will probably take more then one try and that nicotine patches tend to work the best. Also depending on where you live, some universities will give them out for free in exchange for you answering some questions. "
"your first 3 days to one week are going to be tough on your body. The remaining years of your life are going to be tough on your mind. Cold turkey is the easy way out but be ready for the mess: insomnia, anxiety, mood swings... YMMV. Try to compensate with exercising.

2 years later and I still feel the urge to smoke. The key here is that you become aware that the feeling will go away in very few minutes till the next urge. Wait it out and with time, the time between urges will expand. 

You have to want to quit. This is the most important part. If you're not convinced or doing it for someone, then you won't have the will to see it through. Again, this is a very hard fight and a very internal one, both mentally and physically. "
I read this as “ex-workers”. The comments really confused me. I’m high. 
If your friends smoke then change your friend group.  It's hard to stop doing something when it's always around you.  Worked for me.
Just quit.
When you want to smoke.... Don't 
"I've quit multiple times, the longest span was 12 years.  I smoked my last cigarette on Dec 31st, 2011; 10 months later I won the cancer lottery: tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. The treatment, chemo and radiation, was a bear.  I won't be firing up again this lifetime.

Go cold turkey.  Fight the cravings; they get further and further apart. Good luck."
"Different smokes for different folks.

I tried cutting down a time or two. That never worked for me - I’d always creep back up to a couple of packs per day. 

Finally I’d had enough - mostly it was the smell, I think. I went cold turkey. First it was “I can make it an hour”. Then it was two. Then it was make it to lunch, end of the work day, etc. 

What may have helped was that it was not the only big change - I’d just gotten promoted to the next level of help desk cubicle dweller, and as part of that was hired on permanently (had been a contractor temp). Different group, different boss, different part of the building.

I theorized that if I could make it through the stress of all that without bailing out of quitting, then I could survive just about anything without starting again.

Theory was correct, I think. I’ve quit my job, moved states, started a business, gained a family, raised two kids to adultishhood, and haven’t smoked since the day I decided I’d had enough, 16 1/2 years ago.

"
"I started vaping, while I only traded one habit for another I do feel a lot better and my breathing is better after 5 years."
"I don't know if this will help at all, but when I quit it was entirely by accident. I had a wisdom tooth that needed to come out immediately. After the surgery, I wasn't allowed to smoke for a week, which is coincidentally how long it takes to break the chemical habit. So ... I guess ask your dentist if you need any surgeries your insurance will cover?"
"This may never be seen, but what worked for me was drinking ice water through a straw.  I also re-finished a dining room set at night so my hands were always covered in gloves and messy paint goop.  That kept me from wanting me hands anywhere near my face.

&#x200B;"
"Quit with someone. My wife and I quit together so we had a support system. Also, after a few days I could start smelling things again and that was amazing. Then I smelled the smoke on someone who just put a cigarette out. I couldn't believe how harsh of a smell it was to me. That also helped me a lot. "
"I started smoking e-cigarettes with really high nicotine content. 12mg I think. Then I started buy e-juices with lower nicotine content. Now I still smoke the e-cigarettes but with no nicotine. I like the flavour and the feeling of smoke (really Vapour) coming out of my mouth, but I am definitely not physically addicted to nicotine anymore."
"Quit buying cigarettes, quit smoking cigarettes, quit going places where you used to smoke, quit hanging out with people you smoke with, etc."
"Exercise and stay clear from other smokers, at least for the first couple of weeks."
I quit cigarettes and moved to dip. How do you quit dipping now.
"There are a lot of cues that trigger a person to reach for a cigarette. Those need to be replaced with something, or at least shaken up a little. Waking up, eating, getting in a car, these are things that are going to remind you of smoking. Try to associate something else with these cues.

Try forcing yourself to wait a minimum period of time between each smoke, and gradually increase that time until you’re only smoking one a day, then stop.

Most of all, want to quit. Accept infrequent moments of weakness. Never give up entirely."
"Whenever I wanted a cigarette, I ate a pepperoncini and took a walk. Whenever I wanted to eat everything in sight, I ate pickles. Both are low calorie, so absolute minimal weight gain, which kept the incentive up. Jumping jacks through cravings, run up and down a flight of stairs through cravings. Then take a nice long walk, breathing deeply. And more pickles and peppers, as needed."
"Be honest, but also don't put too much pressure on yourself, too many people I know who have tried to quit put too much pressure on themselves to quit that they cracked, smoked, considered themselves a failure, and kept smoking.

I started smoking a little bit before my 18th birthday, and I quit about 2 or 3 years ago, I smoked a pack a day or more, and I have pretty bad asthma, I was more overweight than I am now and had/have sleep apnea, every night I would stop breathing in my sleep and wake up choking for air, and desperately looking for my inhaler with my throat and chest burning, and if I was lucky that would happen only once a night. And after using my inhaler I would go outside or open my bedroom window and light up a smoke.

My dad smoked 3-4 packs a day from the time he was 18 until the same time I quit (he actually quit a little while before I did), and growing up I watched him cough until he passed out more times than I can count, I would watch him get winded picking up something on the floor, and I saw how it affected myself as a child, my mother, my sister and saw the pattern of every dog we owned getting cancer.

Both he and I tried to quit so many times and failed, mine was always giving in when the cravings hit or putting too much pressure on myself, and his was always buying a pack when he got cranky (or my mom would because she got tired of him being bitchy)

But when he quit it showed me I could do it, he _wanted_ to quit, whereas I really didn't want to quit so much as just stop being sick all the time.

He used a vape, patches and gum all at once, I on the other hand used just gum and the old ""one day at a time"" saying as well as the old adage about exercise and just doing it every day, I told myself the first day that I only had to make it through that day, and I said the same the next, and the next.

I also posted on Facebook about how smoking made me feel, how it made me look, how it affected my friendships and clothing, affected my family, etc. And anytime I felt like smoking I could look at it and see my own words, my own promise to myself.

I also told my friends and family I was serious and I would need their support, and even my friends who smoked would refrain around me and encourage me.

And I made it, I am sick less often, my inhalers last much longer, I have lost weight, quit drinking so much soda, eat less, and am happier.

Now that's not to say I haven't faltered or been tempted, I work with mostly smokers, both my bosses smoke and I go outside with them when they smoke, and I am tempted everyday to bum one, but I just remember all the things it did to me, all the people and pets I watched die from cancer, how many of my family members have died from cancer, and how it would set me back from all the progress I have made, and I think about the one time I _did_ cave and have a smoke, when I decided I would prove to myself I didn't want them and I felt like shit immediately after lighting it, and hated the taste but made myself finish it, my lungs felt like shit after, my mouth tasted like shit, my water tasted like shit, food tasted like shit, and I didn't brush my teeth before bed so I got to taste the shittiness the next morning, and I had a small coughing fit when I woke up, I hated myself and swore I wouldn't do it again.

I did the same thing with dip, since I quit that at the same time, when I caved to the craving and it gave me a stomach ache and made me nauseous for the next hour or so, and whenever I get the craving for dip I think of that, same as smoking. 

TL;DR
Be honest, be fair, realize you're only in competition with yourself, you set the rules, and you're basically just trying to go one day at a time trying to beat your high score, and if you falter, just get back on the train. Hold yourself accountable and it may help to ask others to hold you accountable, you can do it. "
I bought a vape and moved to a state I can't afford cigarettes.  Slowly reduce dosage of nicotine. 
"It’s actually really fucking easy, just quit after 15-16 years or so. The first few days is tricky and all you do is chew nicorette for like 2-3 days and then you can go without. The cravings disappear really quickly if you let them."
"Everytime I wanted a cigarette, I would suck on two peppermint Altoids and it would stop the cravings."
"Keep trying and trying until you hate it. That’s what I did. Quit in 2013. I had a few puffs here and there for the first two years and then finally it disgusted me so much I don’t go near it at all anymore. Hate the smell, hate everything about it. You can do it OP!"
"This is kinda long, but there’s no TL;DR.

I used to smoke... a lot. Like 3 packs of Export A Green King (known as “green death”) a day. Yeah. A day. I loved smoking. I would chain smoke. I would wake up in the middle of the night for a smoke. I had that “smokers squint” from constantly having a dart in my mouth.

I started waking up coughing... for like, half an hour. Eventually, that coughing produced deep red, bloody phlegm. I got worried. I went to the doctor, and he told me I had early onset emphysema.

I was 24.

I asked him if he had any advice on quitting. I was ADDICTED. I couldn’t quit in my own, I didn’t have the will power. I’d tried.

He suggested Champix (Chantix in the US, a brand of varenicline), and I took the advice. Except I could afford the medication. 

As it happened, my family was attempting to quit smoking. After my mom quit, she still had a few weeks left of the several month program, and offered them to me. I took them, adjusted the dosage (later weeks have a higher dosage than earlier weeks), and gave it my best shot.

I took into consideration advice from my family, and my doctor, and made myself a simple rule. After the first 2 days, any time I wanted a smoke, I waited 5 minutes. That was in the way of “I’ll finish this chapter, then I can go for a smoke.” Or “I’ll reach the checkpoint, then I’ll go for a smoke”.

At first, it was hard to put a smoke off even that long. But by the end of the week, I’d put it off for 5, and the forget for 30. The end of the next week, that 5 minutes turned into 3 or 4 hours.

Once I went a full day, I gave my roommate the rest of my carton, and I quit. 3 weeks into the course, I went from 3 packs a day to nothing, and it took almost no effort.

So my advice? TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR! Quitting is hard, and if you can’t do it on your own, there’s options and assistance you can lean on it. And you only have to do this once. Everyone says you fight it the rest of your life, and it’s true, to an extent, but it’s just once in a while you think “I could use a smoke... fuck it, not worth it”. The cravings you start with dissipate, I promise. I’ve been quit 9 years, and I only think about missing smoking once every couple months, for like, 30 seconds.

And as much as I do occasionally miss smoking, I enjoy not coughing up blood. I enjoy not having to use oxygen. I enjoy being able to exercise and not damn near die. And I enjoy the extra $1500/month (that’s what my habit would cost now).

Good luck."
"Getting pregnant worked for me. 

But seriously, even that came down to wanting to quit/quitting cold turkey, no excuses. I tried picking it up again after I had my son, and I hated it (thankfully). Husband quit when I did, but he vapes now. "
"Can someone give me the motivation to quit vaping? Is it impacting my health? I understand you aren’t supposed to vape unless it was to help get off the cigs. But I’ve picked up vaping as a hobby in the last year and I’m 21. The only real reason I would see for me to quit would be a health risk, and I look things up saying that vaping is like 90% healthier etc. So, with that said I never smoked cigarettes in the past, I just vaped. Am I actually putting myself in danger of life shortening, disease and things of that nature? "
"Not really. I mean, be careful of overdoing it, inhaling water vapor into ones lungs CAN lead to various issues such as pneumonia. But generally speaking it’s harmless. Yes, it’s nicotine, so it IS an addiction, and a pretty nasty one at that (in terms of ease to quit) but as long as you’re comfortable with the concept of HAVING an addiction, vaping is more or less harmless. "
"The most accurate “anti-smoking” ad I’ve seen was from one saying - don’t give up on giving up. Every cigarette you don’t smoke is one step closer to quitting. As long as you WANT to quit and you’re actively doing things to help you quit, you will get there!"
"There are two ways you can view yourself:

A smoker who's trying to quit

Or

Somebody who used to smoke

It's just a perspective switch, but one of those people has a hell of a lot more power than the other. Try it."
"Get pregnant.
"
I used to do that. Doesn't work anymore since I can't get knocked up lol
Just rip the bandaid off and go cold turkey. Do it when you don’t have to focus on anything important for a few days. Instead of taking drags take drinks. Good luck. 🤙🏼
"I started having constant issues with acid reflux which really interfered with my life. So I went on a strict diet and quit smoking cold turkey, was easy in that situation.

I don't think I would've quit otherwise, I didn't really want to before the health stuff. I think it's important to want to quit in order to do so successfully.

A few years later when I was on the verge of divorce I picked it up again. But I quit again (for good, it seems) after I started going out with my current SO. He didn't mind the smoke and said it was up to me if I ever quit, but that he would like if I did at some point. He said he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and would hate if some of our years together would be taken away by smoking induced health problems. That resonated with me a lot better than my ex husband who tried to tell me 'I had to quit'."
Pregnancy. It's been three years. 
Just fucking do it and stop giving yourself excuses 
"This doesn’t work for everyone, but I smoked for about 15 years. One day I stopped buying cigarettes. I’d tap the odd one from mates when I was in the pub, after a few months I wasn’t bothered anymore and haven’t smoked I cigarette in over 10 years. I did have a few spliffs in Canada a few months back, but that’s doesn’t count right?  Bloody amazing it was too👍"
Switch to vaping. Break the rituals surrounding the smoking habit with vaping but then ween off the nicotine with the vaping before developing new rituals around vaping. If you relapse switch to vaping again ASAP. Repeat as needed. 
Stay away from smokers for a few months.  it will help a lot.
I replaced it with magic the gathering. Now I’m homeless.
Get pregnant! Worked like a charm for me. 
know your triggers and avoid them
Find an important reason to quit.
"I ripped it off like a bandaid. I said to myself that if I didn't do it then, I would die. And I never did it again aside from an occasional handful of times here and there."
"This isn't about quitting nicotine but instead quitting weed smoke. I found that going to edibles allowed me to quit smoking and noticed I didn't have the same cravings with edibles, which made it easier to quit weed altogether."
"Probably it will be buried but an honest question deserves an honest answer. I set myself a date, my 30th birthday which was some months away and then continued smoking guilt-free while subconsciously anticipating that day, to the point that I was looking forward to it. Come my birthday I stopped cold turkey after 14 years a smoker and it was easy. I psyched myself.
 I would love to say I never looked back (over ten years now) but the times I have smoked since have only ever been on an evening, or for a week or two, the longest time being 2 months. The difference from all my failed attempts at giving up previously is that I no longer think of myself as a smoker. It’s a strange thing the mind."
"Just stop smoking. Job done.

That's all I did. Just stopped and got on with life and stopped thinking about it."
I went to vaping honestly. I still smoke when I'm at drills usually but not at home. Idk if that really counts but that's basically how I stopped smoking regularly.
Stop buying cigarettes. 
"I tried everything for years. Patches, the pills, the mint things and vaping.

Eventually I got so mad with myself I bought another vape with 12mg, 6mg, 3mg and 0mg nicotine juices and just had to will power my way through it.

I was so sick of failing and going back to the cigarettes I think I’d just made myself so worked up I just stuck with it.

I vaped for about 3 months and figured every time I bought cigarettes was at the petrol station and grocery store so before I walked in I would just pump the hell outta the vape. 

I could control the urges enough not to buy cigarettes so I never had any to smoke. I just worked my way down on the nicotine in the juices and eventually was just vaping 0mg juice.

Then I would hide the vape out of sight so I wouldn’t see it and want to vape. Couple weeks of that I’d given up the vape and now I don’t even know where the damn thing is."
I gradually cut down to the point I was only smoking maybe 3 or even less daily. I still kept the pack of cigarettes with me as it was my safety blanket. There were days I didn’t smoke at all but knowing I had the cigarettes made me feel better. Going cold turkey from there was way easier. I also avoided drinking for the first couple months (cigarettes and alcohol you know). I also stopped hanging out with friends who smoked until I felt I was in a stronger place mentally. It’s been almost 5 years and now I’m completely free. I have no desire to smoke whatsoever. I should mention I was smoking for almost 15 years. 
"The main thing  that helped is that I addressed my mental health. When I cured my anxiety more or less, I didn't feel the need to calm myself with cigarettes anymore. "
"Do not wait until the next big event or life change is over before you quit. 

A change in your routine is the absolute best thing for helping to avoid the smoking routines you have built up. It forces you to go out of your way to smoke, instead of always having your morning cig with a coffee then another during your work break etc. 

So if you're going on vacation, changing jobs, moving house, or just getting through the holidays with extra people around, don't think ""I will quit when this is over""; quit NOW. It's honestly the best time. "
"I got 2 of my coworkers off cancer sticks with vaping, one is going on 7 months and the other is at 3 months but both of them wanted to give up cigs so i just pushed them into a better direction"
"Not quite an ex-smoker but maybe someday. As many have said, you have to actually want to quit. My problem is if I have a moment of weakness and buy a pack I will smoke them all. I do want to quit but there are times I would still enjoy one such as having a Scotch after a long day or maybe with my coffee on the one morning I don't have to rush out the door. So I keep a couple cigars around, the cost is a dollar and a few drags gets me past buying cigarettes.  Worse case if I go thru a couple cigars a day it was still better than 1 or 2 packs of cigarettes. "
Bupropion 
"Haven't had a cig since July. Was a pack and a half a day smoker. I switched to a vape. With mod style, not the blu/jewel kind. 

You have got to make it past the first two week hump. Its easier after the first week. Way easier after the 2nd. I was smoking red 100's and there is obviously more than just nicotine in those that I was addicted to. But the vape helps.

Best tip I got was from the guy at the shop I got the vape from. I told him I was quitting cigs and to give me the strongest vape juice he had and he said not to go high. Start at a 6 or 8 nicotine at highest, because if you hit it over and over trying to make up for ciggs, you can make yourself sick. Like slapping on 4 patches at once. 

I started with 6 and every time I went to get more I would buy a bottle of the same and the next one down. Slowly weaning down. Finally bought a 1 and a zero and had been mixing them to a higher ratio of zero. 

Now I've been vaping the zero for a couple days and I haven't felt like killing anyone. Debating on giving it to a friend to help him quit when I think I'm done with it, or keeping it in case I get tempted if I get drunk.

Also be careful of the things that trigger you really wanting a smoke. Eating, drinking, sex, stress, etc. Especially in those first two weeks. Eating but never till the point I felt full helped. 

Also my partner has mentioned that it's far better to smell like cookies than cigarettes, which I have empathy for now that I'm starting to get a sense of smell back. "
"nicotine gum, quit for *a little over a year and
I smoked for 30 years and that shit gets ingrained a bit. I think about how good food tastes and how bad smoking stinks. When I get in the elevator with someone that smokes I can smell it. I don’t judge, I smoked for a long time but I’m glad I can tell the difference at least. Quitting sort of makes you feel a little more clean. Its actually really fucking awesome. If you slip up, get back on it. I’ve quit for months even a little over a year before at a time, I’m hoping this one sticks because it’s been *a little more than a little more than a year this time and I’m doin good. Whatever ya do, don’t give up. Get good at quitting. "
"Change your routine. Wake up a little later, pick up a new hobby, see if you can change your hours a bit at work, pick up some overtime or take a short vacation. For me, quitting only works if I make myself so busy I don't have time to smoke, or switch up my schedule so I forget to smoke because it's no longer part of my routine. "
" For me I was dumb and smoked way too young, for way too long, during way too many health issues, so coughing up blood was what pretty much did it, damage is done and I'll probably get the worst of it in a few more years.

A lot of it is just keeping busy. Find something to chew, something to fidget with, avoid stress where possible. 

If all else fails, do some math and realize how much money you're freeing up."
"I smoked a pack a day for a long time and these are the tips I can give for quitting.
1. Try to hang out with people who smoke less at least for the first couple months.
2. I got a vape started at a high dose of nicotine and moved down 2% every time I ran out of juice until I reached 0%. Once I was at 0% I used my vape for a little longer but then realized I wasn’t gaining anything from smoking it and put it down and never picked it up again. 

Hope this helps someone quit! It’s been four years and I haven’t looked back "
"Just do it. You can use aids, but at the end of the day if you don't have the willpower to quit cold turkey like I did you're more likely to be like my mom who has quit at least 10 times in my 32 years alive through this or that method. It's hard, incredibly hard, but it's so worth it."
"Focus on the taste it gives in your mouth it’s disgusting, also after only a couple days your mouth already feels much fresher assuming you take proper care of it. Focus on that aspect it helps a lot"

My mom smoked for 30 years. She quit cold turkey by eating a LOT of licorice. 
Cocaine
I picked up a pack of cigars and smoked that when urges got bad.
I found the hardest thing to give up was my morning cigarette. I completely changed my morning routine to avoid having the opportunity to have a cigarette which worked for me. 
Easy Way to Stop Smoking from Allen Carr. Highly recommended
"Make sure you're quitting for your own reasons. I tried to quit so many times for someone else, and it never worked. One day i just woke up and decided I didn't want to smoke anymore. Haven't had one since, it's been about two and a half years. 
I also limited myself to how many smokers I hang around. If a friend of mine smoked, I'd avoid being around them while they were smoking. I'm fine being around it now, other than the fact that I hate the smell. 
Willpower is the most important thing. Just keep reminding yourself why you want to quit. Remind yourself you're doing a good thing. 
(I ended up gaining over 30 pounds when I quit so try to keep your eating and exercise habits the same when you quit, otherwise you might end up like me. But remember gaining weight is almost inevitable and that's okay.)"
Track the cost - only way I found worked for me. 
Vape. Now I barely even use the vape. Smoked over 20 years a pack a day at least. Also before quitting I forced myself to buy shitty brands of cigs. They were gross. It helped to vape more smoke less. Haven’t smoked In a year and a half
"Get really sick and nearly die. I’m on my 11th day in the hospital. Started off with kidney stones, then an e. Coli infection, then sepsis. I woke up twice in ICU. Seeing my daughters that scared has convinced me that I don’t need it. I was healthy 34 year old women by the way. "
"This is probavly too late for anyone toi notuce, but I quit cold turkey after simply realizing that I dont need a cigarete. Itt gives you nothing other than relief from the very mild abstinence you are feeling which will dissapear after less than two weeks."
Don't be around people the first day. They're more likely to annoy you and make you light up a cigarette when you're on edge like that.
"I switched to nicotine gum and was on that for a couple of years.  Then something happened where I couldn't have any gum for a week.  Once I went through those withdrawals, I decided to quit.  And compared to cigarettes, it really wasn't as hard.  Haven't smoked for about 8 years now and I don't miss it at all.  Helps that I don't hang around anyone who smokes anymore either."
Ask your doctor about chantix
"I'm not an ex smoker, but there are certain periods where you're most likely to relapse. I got this information for my dad, but if u try quitting and suddenly got an urge years later, it's part of the fact. Try to stay strong, and don't give up even if u relapse. Smoking a few doesn't mean u have to go back to smoking daily, so forgive yourself an keep trying even if u lose the battle at times. "
"Ween yourself and be willing to avoid activities that make you want to smoke

Count out how many cigarettes you average a day.

The first month, cut that number in half

The next month, cut that new number in half.

If that’s too drastic a change, cut in 1/3’s and add on extra months to the weening

And don’t be upset if you backslide a bit because of stress or the ritual of it.  If you are on 10 smokes a day down from 20...and one day you have 14 instead of 10.  Its ok.  Shit happens.

Just get right back on the horse.  One day doesn’t erase your progress

By weening yourself...you are giving the body a chance to adjust. 

Sure...you’ll feel like dammit the more you ween off, but you’ll feel infinitely worse if you just do a hard stop.  And if you need more than a month at each level...take it

The result is the important thing, not how you get there

And as for avoiding smoking situations...it sucks but stay out of bars til you get the cravings under control.  

When your friends take a smoke break at work, do something else like walk a lap around the building or go sit in your car and listen to your fav music really loud.

If your employer is strict about breaks but allows smoke breaks...talk to them.  Tell them you are trying to quit and are using smoke breaks times to get your mind off the craving

Just make sure you are getting your work done so they dont think you are just goofing off


Strong ass mouthwash helps too.  If certain foods make you crave a smoke, like coffee.  Take a big ol swig and swish for 30-60 seconds.

It’ll help with the taste related cravings

It’s a process folks

You need a plan.  You need a schedule.  And you need self motivation

You have to *want* to quit for yourself.  Otherwise you’ll end up backsliding

"
"A little lalate for this. You have to do it all at once. Dont do it gradually, its harder. Try to quit in one hit, and deal with the anxiety it brings. First three days are the worst. Dont drink for a month either, or temptation will overcpme."
"I've been smoke free for roughly a year now. Best advice is just stop. Stop right now. None of this ""when this pack is done"" or ""the work week is so stressful i'll stop on the weekend"" etc. Also mo cutting down to 4 a day or whatever. It won't last. You'll be saying ""oh well 5 a day is only 1 more than 4."" Next thing you've smoked 10 and the next day youre smoking what you were before. Just quit completely right fucking now. I also have no personal experience with quitting aids like the patch. Maybe they work maybe they don't. I know i have an addictive personality and i quit cold turkey one day without hesitation. It really sucked for less than a week and then got much better. Now i've been over it for months"
"This is going to sound kind of stupid, but if you can create obstacles which obstruct whatever your usual method of acquiring cigarettes is (and any rituals associated with smoking), you probably have a better chance of quitting than by trying to consciously kill the habit.

For example, I tried quitting by ramping down my cigarette consumption (literal forced rationing) once I got to about 6-8 cigarettes a day. It worked for a couple of months at a time but eventually I was always back at previous consumption levels after dealing with any particularly stressful (mostly work, sometimes social) event. It just didn't work.

Over time I began to gravitate towards a particular brand and type of cigarettes (thin menthols). Not every vendor in my city had them, so I ended up eventually always buying from one particular guy near my apartment. I developed a rapport with the guy. Eventually, I had to move to a new city, where it so happened that no one super close to my new place sold them. Sure, I could still get them, but it was a 20 minute walk, not a shop right next to my building, and anyway, I didn't know anyone, so I couldn't smoke/chat with the dude I was buying cigarettes from.

I tried other brands that the nearest cigarette shop sold but they just didn't scratch the itch in the same way. And just like that I ended up quitting because the usual ritual of acquiring them got interrupted.

Now hopefully you don't have to actually move to another city, but anything you can do to make the ritual a little inconvenient will help you a lot."
Not smoking helps 
Vape
"Vaping, now I just gotta quit this instead. But at least I can run 10k now."
"It's hard.  Get a good motivation.   Mine was when a friend got cancer and had his larynx removed.  He had one of those buzz-boxes that he put over a hole in his throat in order to talk.

Once you stop, remember that it is the first smoke that gets you hooked again.  That does not seem intuitive, but if you never take the first one, you never have to go through quitting again."

Wellbutrin 
"I was a very heavy smoker (at least a pack a day) for 10 years. 
I decided I really wanted to quit so for a few days before I did, everytime I smoked I made myself really focus on it. With each inhale I took, I made myself picture the smoke go into my lungs, my brain ect. I would spend the whole 2 or 3 minutes of smoking that cigarette being very honest with myself about what I was actually doing. 

Then.. and this might sound like really bad advice.. I lied to myself..  a lot haha. 

When I would really want a smoke, I would say out loud something like ""man! I'm so glad I'm not smoking. I would hate to smoke right now.. so disgusting""
Or if someone asked me how I was getting on with quitting,i would tell them I was getting on fantastically and was not missing them at all (thank you for asking giant talking cigarette)

Also for the first month, I let myself eat whatever the hell I wanted. I deff put on a bit of weight but nothing irreversible (as it was only 4 weeks). "
"If you are badly addicted and really struggle to give up, your doctor can prescribe Valium (diazepam). It is very effective to get over the first couple of weeks of cravings. You have to be careful you don’t end up addicted to diazepam instead."
Have the support of a significant other 
"I tried quitting a couple times before I actually did. I dont think this would work for everyone, but I went on a 2 week field exercise without access to a place to buy more cigarettes. Just flat out not having access was the only way i got over the physical, must have a smoke.

After that, the biggest help was simply NOT BUYING A PACK. 

Also, recognize that you may lapse, accept that its ok, and continue on.

It also really really helps if your friends help you out. ""hey can I get a smoke"" ""fuck off you are quitting""."
I basically quit i still have a device and i only use it to grab a buzz like once a day
You're  wasting money. Use the money to buy ps4 oe something  set a goal
"Try a vape, but try and get oils that contain a nicotine dosage under what your typical amount from a cigarette would be (depends if you're smoking reds or blues or how much you smoke) continue to drop down the amount of nicotine percentage through the coming months to the point where you're essentially just vaping oil. Occasionally you will feel the need to smoke a cigarette, but plow through it and continue using your vape in those times of aggressive cravings. Additionally, It's okay to have a smoke when you're out socializing (at a bar, drinking), because you probably will do it.

You will save so much extra money at the end of the month, your lungs won't feel half as bad."
"I have a buddy who smoked pretty much his whole life after 14 or so. We're in our mid 20's and he's tried to quit a few times.

He's actually doing a *really* good job this time, it's been about 6 months. He said after awhile the cravings do go away. Until that point, for him it was straight willpower. 

He also said much of why he continued to smoke was (beyond the physical addiction) his oral fixation/the physical habit, so he supplemented it with smoking weed. That may or may not be a good alternative for you depending on where you live, the legality in your area, what job you have or what jobs you'll want to have, etc. "
I did a lot of LSD-25. Quitting was not hard after acid made you feel the inside of your lungs and what you had done to them for 12 years. Even in the middle of the worst depressive episode of my life (bipolar) I dropped that shit and never looked back. From over a pack a day to nothing. Took about a week and it was already in the rear view mirror both physically and mentally.

No it's not.
"Vaping helps. I’ve not had a cigarette since August of last year. 

I had tried, unsuccessfully, to quit with patches. Didn’t work: they were expensive, made my arm itch, and the lack of hand to mouth fixation made me more irritable than going without nicotine at all.

Vaping has completely satisfied the craving."
"As ridiculous as this may sound - meeting someone with Cystic Fibrosis was the final motivator for me. This person has lungs going to shit and it's not something they have a choice about - and here I was - doing it on purpose.

&#x200B;

Not worth it. It's been about 5.5 years now and it's the best decision I ever made, I never regret it - do I miss smoking sometimes? Sure but it's not nearly as difficult now. I did the patch, for the 6th or 7th time in my 13+ year history with smoking.. I did the patch for about a week and got tired of it so I took it off and just. stopped. It sucked, but I lived through it and here I am, 5.5 years later - breathing fine and able to donate all my organs.

It's only hard if you don't really want to stop. I quit from one day to the next when my then girlfriend said she doesn't like the smell. No withdrawal, and I was on 2 packs a day for years.

I think ""quitting smoking is so hard"" is propaganda spread by the tobacco industry, and/or the ""quit smoking"" self help and pharma industry (which may well be their side business)."
Yeah I'm gonna call bullshit on this.

"Exercise and diet.

Definitely finding a new hobby to take up time and keep you busy helped, for me it was focusing on exercise and getting into shape. I occasionally go sit outside like I did when I smoked."

"Maybe try to get her to switch to a vape? Not perfect, but it is something better than smoking. And if it's the tobacco flavor she misses, there are those flavors as well. As well as menthol, depending on what she smokes. If she were to go for a real one, not a pen, she could mix the two."

I read a lot of comments saying ""want to quit"". False. I mean, sure you want to quit someday and you are waiting for the day that you do not want a cigarette that much so it's easy. No, you are an addict, you'll always want to smoke. That's where the ""hate"" is useful. Do not give you the pleasure of smoking, torture yourself by wanting to smoke so bad and not allowing that, you do not deserve that.

First week will be the worst. First month and you will still want to ""just one..."" NO. Make it a game, or a punish o what ever it gives you more energy. I started this method when i got very sick and i ran out of cigs, then a game of ""how more days can i tolerate?"", then i needed! but i was 6 days out, and applied that ""hate"" mode thinking that I'll always want to smoke and I would suffer the day i try to quit, make that day TODAY.

I thought while I was quitting that it wasn't worth living the rest of my life always wanting a cigarette so I thought maybe I should just give up and smoke, but forced myself to make it through it, just to find out one time. ... and I found out that it's not like that at all. I have zero desire to smoke at all. What your head is doing to you right now is lying to you. It's all lies. The way it feels right now goes away after a while, and the good news is that you've made it past the hardest part. It's slowly getting better now.

"alan carr's - easy way to stop smoking did it for me.

basically, you have to remember that cigarettes are in fact not pleasant to have, and that if you looked at your situation, from a rationally thinking (non nicotine addiccted person) you are so better of.  and also, apparently  after three days there is but trace amount of nicotine in your system, so now it is all mental."
"Quit 11 months ago after 8 years of smoking. I took up exercise and lost 40 pounds - for the first time in my life I am not obese, I have been very overweight literally as long as I can remember. I am now working on building some muscle and then cutting down to a BMI in the normal range.

When you stop smoking for good, it's like an inside joke that the smokers don't get. Every time you see someone smoking, you get why they smoke, but *you* don't need nicotine anymore - not like those fuckers do. You're better than that. 

You don't need a nervous crutch. Don't need to be embarrassed trying to sneak out. You don't need to hide the stench from that girl you've been talking to. When you're stressed, you work out - and you feel fucking great after. 

Successfully giving up smoking feels like swimming across a lake. And when you reach the other side - you turn around and see that dock filled with cigarette butts burning down and taking all the other smokers with it - while you're safe, happy, and healthy on the other side. 

That's the only way I can explain it. It's just, so worth it."

Speaking from personal experience though, quitting is very refreshing."
"I smoked a pack a day of Camel Filters from about age 15-20. I quit cold turkey after two or three attempts. I got me some of those Tea Tree flavored chewing toothpick things. They really help deal with the oral fixation as well as give you something to grit your teeth on during cravings. When you quit you feel so much more healthy. You get your senses of smell and taste back. You don't get winded going up a flight of stairs. You will save a ton of money. It's a liberating feeling to not NEED a cigarette after a meal or when you wake up or when you have a drink. Stick with it man, you will thank yourself. "
"Good luck dude, 4 days is a fucking long way to come, don't look back!  I'm trying to quit myself right now and I must say that lozenges and patches and a really horrible flu helped me for the first part.

Truth be told I'm just too lazy to have to maintain an addiction.

I agree, this bit sucks. But really, would you put yourself through this to go back?"
"Do you have any side effects from going cold turkey?  When I did that a few years ago, I got the shakes and nausea for a week...

Edit:  To help you keep up the good work here's some [reading material for you...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_Obstructive_Pulmonary_Disease)"
"I quit cold turkey four years ago and did not even throw away the packets while doing so (had them around in the car and drawers) -  don't make it about unavailability, just your willpower, it still amazes me I could pull it off. Teeth clean, no funky smell on clothes, house and car, no bad looks from people, no dependence (that's the greatest) you breathe better... enjoy being smoke-free. It really is wonderful quitting. And don't even think about giving it a go again, even if its not a whole cigarette, it is not worth it.  "
Food! It actually tastes like something!
I have been clean for almost a year now. And I feel so energetic I can't believe I smoked for so long just to become lethargic. Hold on for a few more days the cravings will fade believe me.
"I agree with all the benefits that others listed, definitely worth it.  I quit cold turkey over 3 years ago after smoking for over 12 years.What did it for me was this stupid poster I saw in my doctor's office...it gave these stats like the oxygen in your blood returns to that of a non-smoker after a week (or something like that, I don't know the exact numbers) and your lungs return to that of a non-smoker after so many months and so on.  So every time I thought of giving into the cravings, especially in those first couple weeks, I thought about how I'd have to start quitting all over again and start the repairs to my body all over again. It seemed so tedious, and I never did give in. I know this is kind of long but I gotta say the worst part of quitting is the first week. If you can get thru that, you really can do it. Good luck!!"
"I'm on day two, so the nicotine is almost out of my body, but it really is the habit that is hard to break. My friend told me to jog on the spot really hard when you really want to smoke (obviously when you are alone or go to the bathroom or something). It wears you out a little, gives you a little endorphin rush et voila, forget about the smoking for a bit. "
"My breathing is healthy.  Food tastes better.  I don't smell like smoke.  I can say 'no' a cigarette. Cold turkey for 10 months, after 10 years."
"I'm on day 9 after smoking for 10 years. The mood swings and crankiness are horrendous. I can't wait for the cravings to go away but I know it's a long, long road."
"Read the Alan Carr book ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking""."
"Congrats.  I couldn't tell you how life is better after truly quitting, since now and again I always just go cold turkey for a month or so, but it's a great thing you're doing anyway.  Having done this now a few times I will say you do feel better after you get over the initial hump, but that's never the true problem.  Here's what it boils down to:

It's easy to not smoke at any particular point in time.  It's easy to go one day without a cigarette.  It's massively more difficult to aggregate all those together and make yourself into a true non-smoker.  I've never had a huge amount of pain rejecting any one smoke.  It's about being the person who has better things to do than worry about smoking.  I would suggest starting an exercise habit once your lungs feel like they're recovering enough for some strenuous activity.  Go running, biking, hiking in beautiful places.  Enjoy the world.  It's right there for you to do that, and if you find that smoking makes it difficult to enjoy what was given to you, quitting will make sense to you in a way that has much more immediate ramifications than ""it will be a very messy and gruesome way to die one day that I can't really properly envision right now.""

Odd to hear this coming from someone who still is smoking, and certainly the guys who have quit for years now are much better authorities on the matter than I am, but if you find my small experience with going clean now and again helps you, I think it'll be worth it.  Hell, it'll be worth it just to leave it here when quitting time comes for me and I have words to remind myself of what quitting means. ;)

Good luck with what you're doing."
"alan carr's - easy way to stop smoking did it for me.

basically, you have to remember that cigarettes are in fact not pleasant to have, and that if you looked at your situation, from a rationally thinking (non nicotine addiccted person) you are so better of.  and also, apparently  after three days there is but trace amount of nicotine in your system, so now it is all mental."
"I quit smoking in 1992. Much better health, food tastes better and all that. Also I bought a new Harley and a new boat with money that used to pay for smokes.
Keep strong, you can do it. And if you stumble, do not give up. When you learned to walk and fell you didn't give up and tell yourself you couldn't walk. If you have a cigarette now it doesn't mean you can't live without cigarettes, it only means you made a mistake. If you used to smoke a pack a day, having one cigarette does not mean you failed at quitting, it means you succeeded in saying no 19 times in one day.
Stay strong!"
"I have my 3 year anniversary in September and I am SO happy I quit. I smoked a pack a day for 15 years and I feel a zillion times better on my worst day as a non-smoker than I ever did on my best day as a smoker. Look forward to deeper breaths, a better sense of smell and taste, smelling way better to everyone around you, looking healthier. 

In the meantime, while you're quitting, give yourself a break. Do nice things for yourself and be easy on yourself if you have bitchy moments. Once you get past the hard part it's all downhill. 

I'm proud of you for even trying :) "
"I quite 11 weeks ago, went from 1-2 packs a day (for 21 years) to zero.  I've saved over $1000CAD so far (about $350/month) by no smoking 2300+ cigarettes.  In my life time I estimate I've smoked at least 160,000 cigarettes and spent around $40,000CAD.

Don't sweat it too much, do your best.  If you really want to quit you can, it's easier than you think.  If you stumble, just keep going, don't attach too much stress to it - it's like a catch-22 trap - you stress over smoking, which makes you want to smoke more.  Oh - avoid other smokers for a while if you can :)"
"I just gave up smoking 2 months ago, for which I had to quit alcohol and coffee. Have taken up tennis to help me out.

[This](http://blisstree.com/files/2007/06/smoking_timeline_2070x1530.gif) helped me alot!

"
"Two years without after 15 years with. I can breathe easily, am free from the occasional heart attack paranoia and don't get winded walking up stairs. In fact, I'm in the best shape of my life. My skin looks better and I don't smell bad. I have more disposable income, and don't divide my time by my cigarette breaks. And I have more time. Food tastes better. 

If you have a craving, wait it out. They only last five minutes on average. 

Remember, to have a smoke is a conscious choice, not something that just ""happens"" in a moment of weakness. Continue to choose not to. 

Don't have that first one. Its never just one, remember.

Best of luck and good vibes!"
"On year 5 here of quitting.  Quit when i realized I have been smoking half my life...and had a baby girl.  I feel amazing.  The cuffs are off.  Food tastes great.  I sleep better.  Sex is better.  I have soooo much energy and I'm saving tonnes of cash.  Just don't smoke.  Just keep telling yourself that. Just don't smoke...day after day.  The first 2 weeks are the worst.  After that it gets better. However you still get your 'triggers'...ie - drinking, a good meal, coffee...etc.  That will last a long time.  Im not sure how long for you but I can say it is worth it for yourself bro. Just hang in there and TRUST me you will look back at yourself and wonder WHY the hell you even smoked in the first place."
"It's not about me, but I don't like hugging my mom because she tends to smell bad. "
"On year 4, cold turkey, I just smile when I get the urge because I know that monkey is off my back.. "
I'm on day 4 as well.   Reddit solidarity!
"My brother is a college student and has saved over $300 since he came back from school for the summer. And $300 in college money is like $3000 real money.
He quit cold turkey as well. "
"Find a pool and go for a mile-long swim.  Or run a few miles.  If it hurts then you f'ing deserve it slave!  My swims and runs are what keeps me from starting back.  If I do backslide my body feels the damage so much I am compelled to stop.  Just go to bed if you get pissy.  Or get drunk, whatever...just don't smoke.  After 4-5 days the physical addiction is gone.  However, the mental addiction will never go away...but at least the mental addicition doesn't make you an a'hole the way the physical addiction does.  Take it out on your body by swimming/running and not out on anyone else."
"How great will it be when you see the smokers lurking around outside as pathetic victims, instead of as ""cool kids"" ?"
"My wife and I quit cold together nearly 20 years ago, after having smoked as long. Some things that helped:

Nicotine gum. Early on it helped to stifle cravings quickly so you could stop thinking about craving and focus on something else. After a week, we started cutting the gums in half, and a week later in quarters, and when I was thinking about cutting a nicorette into eighths, I figured, ok, I don't really need this any more.

An insight given us by a psychologist we consulted before Q-day: your body is dependent on you to protect it. Cultivate a feeling of responsibility toward your lungs, your arteries, which are completely dependent on you to protect them. Feel parental toward your own innards.

Understand what we called the ""tall grass"" thing. You have associated smoking with all sorts of situations and activities (e.g., opening a beer, pouring coffee, finishing a run...). Every time you do one of these activities, or enter one of these situations, the association is triggered and you think of smoking. But the association is weakened when you don't smoke. So you really have to go through all these life events multiple times, not smoking, to kill the associations. Some you hit often, so they die soon; others come up more rarely, so they surprise you. We likened it to camping in a hay-field: where you walked a lot the grass is quickly flattened, but then we'd stray into the tall grass, hit some still-active association."
Maybe [this](http://i.imgur.com/mYt7J.gif) will help. It was made by redditor NYdiet.
"I've quit a few times I'm sorry to say. This time I'm going on 4 months. It really does get easier, and it's nice not being ostracized :) coming in out of the rain. Not smelling of smoke at the end of the day. Good luck!! Remember 1 day at a time. Do NOT think about forever, think about getting through today, worry about tomorrow tomorrow."
"6 years without a cigarrette, after having smoked for about 7-8 years. Cold turkey never worked for me; what finally did it was the Nicotrol inhaler. Two people I recommended it to actually went and got a prescription for it, and both were able to quit smoking, too.

It's a little weird, but it fucking *works*!"
"Why is that weird?  You're still taking in nicotine, so you haven't really quit all the way."
"I just quit cold turkey, i tried patches, and gum, and all the rest. 

Life is AWESOME you'll start coughing up all kinds of delightful things.

I got a vaporizer, and a 1/8th and stayed in for the long 4th of july weekend. Didn't really do much other than smoke bowls and hang out. that weekend. Also when i was around the house if i didn't want to smoke a bowl i'd do 25 situps when i had a nicotine craving, by time i was done with the situps the craving had passed, and i had done 25 situps. 

Also got an extra about 200-250 a month to blow, on what ever, or save. I'm looking at it like an airplane ticket a month. :-D enjoy your self. Dont try to quit, just stop buying them and finally quit."
Think about being able to take a full deep breath...one of the simplest pleasures in life you have since forgotten about.  You can do it!!!
"I can run a half marathon now, whereas before I couldn't run half a mile. It feels great. And, though I still have terrible urges to smoke not too infrequently, whenever I do succumb the cigarette tastes terrible. Absolutely horrible.

Unless I'm drunk... then it still tastes like a little slice of heaven.

But even that is changing.

The most important piece for me is to remember that if I fail and smoke a couple of cigarettes one drunken night, all is not lost. Temporary failure is just that, temporary. Never, never, never think that one weak moment ruined it all for you.

Good luck.

**EDIT** Oh, I smoked for 7 years, quit for 3 months, smoked again for 5, and have since not smoked a single cigarette in over 4 months."
"I quit fast food cold turkey, and now I'm 40 pounds lighter. Keep up the good work!!!"
"I haven't been able to quit so kudos to you. My close friend quit about three years ago and he says it's the hardest thing he's ever done, worse than really intense break-ups or grad school. My personal suggestion is smoke a whole pack in about a half an hour, or as fast as you can, and then you'll hate yourself so much that you'll never want to smoke again. Or at least that is my plan for when I quit.

Godspeed, dear."
"Read the Alan Carr book, ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking""."
I quit 4 weeks ago cold turkey after 10+ years of smoking. You keep at it. 
"Quit for just over 10 years.

For one thing, I wife would have never dated me if I was a smoker.
I bike to work, hike on weekends and am about to get my black belt in Aikido."
Smoking is bad mmkay.
"Much, much better. You own your lungs instead of giving them to tobacco shareholders."
"I quit cold turkey after smoking for the past 5 years 15 days ago.

Stay Strong"
"whenever you want to sit on the floor wrap your hands around your legs under your knees and roll around like a ball til the feeling passes and you realize how much more interesting your life can be coming up with new ways to not bother, you know it, when your around smokers is the true test, your eyes will zero in on it, ur friends will offer you, don't blame them, just go, i love aggravation, then maybe go outside and try the ball thing again."
WTF?
if you stay off them for another 4 days I'll doodle something for you. [here's some of my doodles](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/cri4m/offer_will_try_to_doodle_something_for_every/)
"Spiritually, smoking stunts you.  You cannot be fully in the moment when you are in the throws of an addiction.  You are not in control of your life, nicotine is."
"Just break the habit of where you normally smoke. If its while driving, or on a break at work, just try to take your mind off of whatever situation. Eat some candy, talk a walk, or while driving put on some music and chew some gum"
"Honestly, good luck man.  Day 4 is usually when I start dreaming of breaking peoples necks in that completely unrealistic way that Van Damme and Seagal do in their (horrid) movies.  Thank god peoples necks are actually really damn strong or quitting smoking would lead to huge swaths of destruction."
"I can take a full breath.  The day it happened that suddenly I could breath in about 10% more my lungs felt like they stretched that way for the first time in forever.  

I can regain my breath in a few minutes now instead of about 30 minutes of wheezing after just a few minutes of exercise.  

I can smell and taste things better.  

Fucking seems to go better.  Earlier to rise and I can do things I used ta couldn't do stamina-wise.  

"
"5 years clean, after a 20 year habit. Thing not many people mention is that you can still miss smoking even after that long quit - especially if you had it tied to something like having a coffee in the morning and relaxing, that really makes quitting it a bitch. Am I better? Dunno, but here smoking is banned almost anywhere where oxygen is present so at least I'm not one of those poor assholes out on the street in the rain on a saturday while everyone else is inside the club."
"This was posted a couple of days ago.

"Dunno if you like wine - if you do, book yourself on a wine tasting tour - you will be completely blown away by all the subtle tastes hidden away in this ordinary drink - as a smoker all these awesome tastes were hidden from you."
On the other hand:  consider the poor tobacco companies that your quitting is putting out of business.  Nobody thinks of the little guys any more!
your penis won't fall off like in the adverts.
"Do push-ups or go for a little jog when cravings hit.  Helps get the blood flowing. Make sure you have some buddies to help you quit go out for walks together when cravings hit, etc. "
"ridiculously so. it only gets easier, before you know it you'll be offended that someone else is smoking, and the world will have come full circle."
"I quit last september, after three years. My sex drive went through the roof, I'm a bajillion percent more confident, I'm stronger, I run farther, I have sex with hotter girls. And I'm able to have a lot more sex, because my stamina went through the roof. 

AND cigarette companies don't own my soul. I have a comma in my bank account. I feel elitism when I go back home to family and the house reeks. I am better than my tobacco-addled parents.

Quitting is the best feeling in the world. Its your trump card for when you feel down. Bomb an exam? Mess up a job interview? Creep out that cutie? WHATEVER. You're still the man because you have the strength to do what so many pussy-ass motherfucking smokers who 'want to quit but cant'. Fuck them, man, you're badass for getting even four days in.

Mad props to you for getting this far, you're over the biggest hurdles. This is a marathon now, training your body to realize that smoking isn't happening in the various situations you're used to.

You know that saying ""whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're right?"" Well that is exactly the fucking case here."
"I've never smoked but my parents do. My Dad is 60 and my step mom is 58, she looks around 70, has no teeth in her head and has this cough that sounds like she's going to keel over dead any second. Quit smoking now or else you'll look 20 years older than you actually are and you're health problems will multiply with every second you keep smoking. You're on the right path, keep going!"
"An insight from those of us who don't smoke: smokers fucking stink, even when they're not currently smoking. Their clothes stink, their hair stinks, their breath stinks. Quite often I will make an excuse to get away from the stench of a nearby smoker.

You'll be starting to smell pretty good now. Keep it up!"
"I quit a few months back, but I only smoked for a few years. I miss it every day. I may start again, sweet delicious nicotine...."
"On August 8th it will 30 years since I have stopped.  The first couple of weeks are the hardest.  

take each urge to smoke one at a time and deal with them at the moment.

Things you have to look forward to are breathing easier and everything tasting better.  

Hang in there."
"In the last year of my PHD program I learned two things.
-Smoking is the main cause of lung cancer.
-Masturbation causes blindness.
Thank GOD, I stopped both, and pray every single day I will never do that again.
Man, look Statistics, just google it.
All there.
"
"I quit 3 weeks ago, allergies are terrible now for some reason, never had them before, and I feel like shit. 


Otherwise it's fucking miserable."
You should look into buying an e-cig. It's like having your cake and eating it too. Plus you can smoke inside and not stink. 
"Nah, it's got nicotine and even if you get the juice without nicotine it reinforces the habit."
"Never started.  It STINKS LITERALLY!!  How can you go back to stinky breath, yellow fingernails and nasty teeth?  

Plus, non smokers like me won't think you are yucky anymore if you stop! :P"
"Stay strong. Forget about the way the pack feels, how it gradually lightens as you pull a light, crisp cigarette to your lips. With a flick and a spark the cherry alights and you pull a soft, slow breath of smooth flavor deep into your lungs. How it warms you, how it soothes you, how it completes you. How no matter where you are or what's going on in your life it's always there for you. You can do it."
It's not better. Continue to smoke.
It's not better. it's different.

LIGHT UP MAN! IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO TURN BACK TO THE DARK SIDE!
ive been clean for 19 years now it feels good to have never started
"Had a friend who tried everything & kept going back. He got so fed up with himself he smoked half a pack, dumped the ashtray in a glass of water and drank it. Puked his guts up. Never smoked again. 


"
"""Raw Turkey"""
Kind of like how I loved tequila until I drank way too much and now just the thought of it makes my stomach turn and my butthole clench up 
That seems like a good method
Don't try this at home?
Jesus...
This is probably bad advice because nicotine is a potent poison at least somewhat comparable to the dosage of cyanide
That's actually incredibly smart... maybe he made it so that he had an actual aversion to it.
"It was difficult for me. I had smoked for about 15 years. I tried to quit twice and failed. Then, I was part of a small, family New Year Eve party. We stayed up all night drinking, smoking, and playing cards. The next morning, my mouth tasted and felt so nasty, I made a New Year resolution to quit. And I did.

My personal quirk was that I kept a pack of cigarettes in my pocket at all times. I knew that if I didn't have any, and a strong urge hit me and I went out and bought a pack, I would be smoking again. So, I essentially made it a war between me and the cigarettes, and I resolved to win that war. Will power. I did win."
"I kept an unopened pack in my purse for   the same reason. It helped!  *knowing* I could have one,  but chosing not to. "
That works if you stay busy right? When I'm at work I usually have nothing to do but smoke
"That's my plan, it's like resistance is better than denying myself because I'm actually winning something. If I just can't have one because there's none there then I'm just, I dunno, irritated, whereas if I can't have one and there is some there then it's my choice. Like I'm saying no rather than being told no, which I hate. "
Sounds just like how I quit. I was a smoker for 30 years. I quit 10 months ago - one day in particular I had smoked about 5 in a row. I was stressed about something. I felt sick and nauseated. I had to lie down. I haven't wanted one since. 
"Does using an ecigs count as cold turkey? If so, that's how I quit.

Furthermore, shortly after I quit my close friends also quit by switching to various ecigs. I used Blue Cig while they both used Juul. "
"Found a distraction to focus on. Ate peppermints or speariment (sp) Lifesavers and drank plenty of cold water simultaneously. When the urge to smoke hit, the combination of the peppermint/speariment and cold water gave my throat and lungs that mentholy feeling while breathing through my mouth that was somewhat similar to inhaling menthol cigarettes."
"This is what also worked for my friend too, except with mint-flavored gum. Chewing gave him something to do when he started feeling restless, and the icy-minty feeling from drinking cold water alongside helped to remind him not to smoke.

Also, when it got too bad, he would ask us to take him somewhere like the gym or whatever. Somewhere out and not in his car so he couldn't go pick up cigs.

"
"Be careful with lifesavers, the mint flavored have sorbitol as a sweetener. It's what they use in hospitals as a laxative. "
"I got a brain tumor!

No I'm serious lol. My tumor was located directly in the center of my brain
 So they had to separate my two frontal lobes in half and go straight into the center of my brain. All my addictions and drug tolerances were reset following that. It was quite interesting."
"Wow, that's fascinating.  Do you mind writing more about it?  I'm glad you are okay!"
"Just have a strong willpower and decide THIS is the day you quit! Don't wait until your pack is empty, break your cigarettes in half and throw them in the garbage. Then after 12 hours, buy a new pack and think about your life and how you're such a sad fucking screwup "
"I read your first sentence and rolled my eyes. But yeah, very accurate portrayal. "
In my experience it is easier to stop smoking at the start of a new day.
"I quit smoking cold turkey when I became pescatarian, I only smoke fish now."
"Thanks, dad. "
"I'm a humanitarian, so smokes are cheap and abundant "
[deleted]
"Fuck me congrats, I know there are dudes that smoked more each day but that's really good. Your future self will appreciate this more."
"Allen Carr for me too, 6 years off after 25 pack years. Never even been tempted."
Allen Carr worked for me. I had smoked for 16 years and quit in a weekend. It has been over three years now
"I've never read it, but I'm amazed how many people swear by that book."
I keep hearing about this book...is it seriously that good??
"For me it was the free ebooks at http://whyquit.com, maybe 5 years ago. But I got a chance to read Carr's book recently, and I can confirm it's good. "
"I quit after reading Allen Carr's book, too. It totally changed my thinking. It's a good book. :)

I was totally skeptical when I started reading it, too. I don't really believe in self-help type books, and thought I'd been suckered into some ""infomercial in a book"" type thing. Joke was on me, it worked. That was the first time. Then I started smoking again. I was really miserable because I had read a few people posting online that if you start smoking again after the Allen Carr book, that it won't work a second time, so I thought I'd messed up big time.

Nope. I smoked for about a year, then read the book again, and it really kicked in the second time. I quit in March of this year, and I'm happy I did."
Realized I was just being a stupid teenager that only smoked tobacco because I didn't have weed. 
"Stopped buying them and stopped talking about them.

Don't be one of those people who goes 3 days and tells everyone they've quit. Don't think about how long you've quit for. Don't let it rule your head. It has no power if you grant it none. 

Fuck anyone who thinks once a smoker always a smoker or those former alcoholics who say they'll always be an alcoholic. Bullshit.

Stop lying to yourself and getting in your own way. It's never as hard as it may seem to do the right thing."
"Yea, not telling anyone I was quitting helped a lot. I think I was on my second week when people started to ask if I was quitting."
I got salmonella from inhaling raw poultry.
Laughed way too hard at this
Tried it on a sandwich and never looked back. 
Just move to Australia... Cant afford to smoke
"One day I woke up tired of hacking up a lung and didn't want to feel like that anymore. 
I ate a lot of red licorice. 

But I did it. 

Cold turkey, working retail,  at Christmas. 
"
"I quit at a really stressful time, too. I was in the middle of my thesis and it was early winter (Christmas makes me angsty around my family), and a series of other stressors. It made it oddly easier to think I dealt with something tough at a tough time in my life."
"My Dad did it at 53 while in intensive care after his heart attack. Hard to smoke while you're on oxygen.

He tried to quit several times but this did it. 
He's still kickin' at 80 "
Didn't light another cigarette or buy another pack. 
"How many pack years did you have until that point?

Pack years: pack a day smoked per year"
"I tried to quit many times using different techniques, but what worked was realizing that I could never smoke even a single puff from a cigarette again, since that would just end up smoking the same again."
"If you seriously want to quit, then it works nicely. 

Because you don't have to think about it anymore. No counting cigarettes, no temptation to light just one more, just problem solved. 

The sensation of liberation far outweighs the slight addiction that will stay with you for like 48 hours. But even that addiction only works if there is the possibility to light a cigarette: if you have already quit, the craving are not strong, because there's nothing you can do about it."
"Tried to quit dozens of times.  I was finally able to quit, with no ""final smoke"" or second thoughts, when my wife announced she was pregnant.  "
"That is great to read. I see so many parents smoking while their kids are around, I cannot comprehend this. You had a great attitude, and congratulations for your child to come. "
"10 push ups every time I wanted to step out and smoke. It was also the 4th or 5th time I quit. Quitting takes practice, don't be too hard on yourself if you fail the first time."
10 push ups is about as long as a nic fit last. So that would work well. 
"I smoked for about 20 years, a pack to about a pack and a half a day, then one day I just quit.

It really didn't take a lot of effort on my part.

The heart attack helped, though.

There is no pain quite like a heart attack. It is intense, it gets you right at the core, and you can't get away from it. You can't distract yourself from it. You can't ignore it. You know you are dying.

Right before the anesthesiologist put me under the surgeon asked me if I was going to quit smoking, because if I didn't, then he was just practicing. I told him I would. 

They brought my wife in, and let us say goodbye before they put me fully under.

One four barrel bypass and three months later, I finally woke up.



As I was in a coma for almost three months, I missed most of the withdrawal symptoms, which I guess was fortunate. Being in the hospital for another few months also helped, as it was a non smoking campus.

After being discharged, I still had cravings for cigarettes, which weren't helped by people smoking around me. I vaped for a while, at 0% nicotine when smokers were over, or when I was at their homes, and while that helped I eventually just had to tell my smoking friends and relatives to take it outside. 

So, I did quit nicotine cold, but I really cannot recommend the method I used. If you keep smoking, though, you might get a chance to try it.

"
Well I switched over to vaping and now I'm on my way to quitting that. It's much easier to go a few hours without vaping than it is without a cigarette.
"I'm a month in now and I feel a lot better, I vape a lot less than I used to smoke and I'm down to 3mg!"
"I read the stories on this Web site and just stopped.

http://whyquit.com/"
"I read The Easy Way by Allen Carr in about 6 hours. It wasn't particularly well written, nothing in it was revolutionary. It just pummeled me in the face with the fact that smoking is an *addiction* and that the addiction wants to keep smoking, not me.  Honeslty by this point I was so absolutely sick of smoking that I would have taken a punch to the face if it meant not having to go to the store to buy smokes.

Separating myself from my addiction was the key. Realizing that the only time I didnt want to light up was when I was already smoking helped me realize that smoking didnt actively  allreviate the addiction, just delayed it. I needed to think of the smoker as separate from myself. I started imagining a mucinex troll in my brain begging for a smoke. And Everytime I told it no, it would sputter and hack and cough and die. The little shit is still there in my brain, limp and with one eye cracked juuust a little bit open; waiting to catch me off guard. 


I won't hide the fact that weeks 5-8 were the hardest, that's when the addition was over enough for my brain to start focusing on other things. Things that until then had been nicely hidden by my crutch, smoking. Suddenly I had no defense or coping mechanisms. Panic attacks became a nearly daily thing. I had to relearn how to cope with stress entirely. It sucked. But the FREEDOM that I have from goddamned cigarettes is absolutely worth all the strife. "
"I had a class in college called Behavioral Self Change. Basically, it teaches you how to change things about yourself that you want to change such as quitting smoking or losing weight. The methods described actually worked. I started the class in August, it ended in December, and I quit smoking January 1, 2013. 

What it boils down to is having a plan. Plan ahead for your quit date. Start to think and realize when you are craving a smoke. Plan for these. Don't depend on just one thing, either. For me, I just needed a distraction. I realized that if I was involved in doing something, I could go hours without a smoke and not realize it until someone else brought it up. My plan was to drink a bottle of water, or have a piece of gum, or get on my phone and play Tetris for a few minutes. As for when I was driving, I had a rubber band on my left wrist that I played with while I drove. 

Funny story. 9 days after quitting, I was driving my sister's car in downtown Daytona Beach with my best friend. We got rear ended by a much bigger vehicle. Both my sister and my best friend are smokers. I was able to resist having a smoke with them because I had plenty of water and gum and I had a plan and I stuck to it. It's been 4 years now and I don't regret a thing. Don't turn a slip into a fall, either."
Meditating about the fact that smoking made my life miserable and there was absolutely zero upside in it.
"Yeah, the cost is ridiculous, in Canada it's $10 a pack, that's $3,650/yr in three years that's over $10K cash... health consequences aside, the financial waste is terrible. "
"Not sure if this counts, but I quit within 3 days, with the help of a nicotine patch. I used 2/3rds of a patch on the first day, half on the second day and a quarter on the third day so that by the third day I was free of the chemical addiction to nicotine. Basically the nicotine patch cushioned the blow of giving up, while I could also start getting used to not having the hand to mouth habit of smoking.

Been 10 years now. 

One other thing that helped was that when I quit I believed myself to be a non smoker from that point on, which really helped me let go of the idea of 'giving up' or 'trying not to smoke'. Those types of thoughts actually hook you back in to having the mindset of a smoker."
First day was hardest. Getting past those moments that would include smoking was hard the first time each. I just did not stop quitting. Thirty years clean now. 
"By accident.  
  
The gas station I worked at back then had packs of Santa Fe for $2.70 a pack.  For that price, I would have smoked newspaper.  So, I get a pack, get about hlfway through, and realize that there's basically no nicotine in them.  I accidentally got over the nicotine dependancy, so I finished the pack and quit.  "
Vaping honestly. Then I quit that after about a year as well. Occasionally have a tank if I'm feeling stressed. Psyched though- smoking was becoming an issue. 
"It took about 6 or 7 tried. I'd usually make it a few weeks then buy a pack. I kept trying and one day it just stuck. Its a process, even if you start smoking again keep trying to quit."
"I'm an ICU nurse and I stopped the night I took care of a patient literally drowning from lung cancer (there were no palliative care beds available). The smell, the noises, everything he had to go through was enough for me to never touch a cigarette ever again (2y2m7d clean now)."
"I started smoking when I was 20 to show a girlfriend how easy it would be to quit. I promised to smoke for a year and then quit. That failed miserably. I smoked for 27 years. I had tried to quit several times and would do ok for a week or 2. I even quit once for a few months, but each time something would happen and I would justify smoking just one pack and that pack would become the habit all over again. Then I chose to make a deal with myself and to be true to my word to myself. I had 4 packs and I smoked them all in one day. The day before I left on a week long camping trip where I never smoked. Before I left I took the shirt I wore while doing the smoking which stunk of stale smoke. I kept it in a baggie. I went on the camping trip and I was occupied with staying warm and doing camping stuff so the withdrawals were not that bad. When I returned I wanted a cig. I would smell that shirt in the baggie and could resist. I also stopped hanging out with friends that smoked. I've been smoke free for 5 years and yet there are days where I still crave. I still have the stinky t-shirt in the baggie...somewhere. Good luck. "
"Changed my habits. Drive a different way to work, cleaned my car so it didn't stink, took walks on my breaks instead of going for a puff. Drank cold water like a crazy person and brushed my teeth a lot! The first week was the worse! "
My wife just nagged and nagged and nagged about it until it was no longer enjoyable.
"This last time... over 1 1/2 years quit now... hot peppers and pickles. Got tired of gaining weight from eating everything in sight whenever I quit. Ate pickles when I wanted to eat, ate hot peppers when I wanted to smoke. "
"Bubble gum. AND LOTS OF IT. I chewed tobacco and smoked cigarettes everyday for about 5 years. Decided after the new girlfriend hated it (and was pregnant with my child) that it was time to quit. Got some gum, chewed it like a savage. My son was born, we got engaged, decided why not and quit drinking alcohol too..been completely sober from everything for around 1.5 years and roughly 3 years from tobacco products..it's great try it! Don't give up!"
My dad did it by cheking himself into rehab for his drinking problem. The hospital didn't allow for smoke breaks so he ended up quitting while he was there. He has been sober AND smoke fee for a month now and I couldn't be more proud.
"I just stopped. Simple as that.

Not the answer you probably wanted to hear but roughly 3 years ago I just thought to myself ""I don't want to be doing this anymore"" and just stopped.

I think it's a will thing personally. There is always gonna be part of you that says you can't do it, but you need to listen to that small part that says you can.

I actually keep the same pack I was on when I quit with me everyday. Has 7 cigarettes left in it. Personally don't feel the urge. I carry it because everyone who knew I smoked kept talking behind my back about how I wouldn't last."
"I made sure i smoked my last cig on my day off.   The hardest thing for me was knowing I had a half a pack or even 3 left in the pack in my basement. 

I then proceeded to just think thoughts like I don't smoke cigarettes.   Never using the word anymore.   Never thinking I'm quitting for now. 

Just I don't smoke cigarettes. 

Working well for me so far. "
"I realized, after many years of course, that it was just wrong and gross. I started smoking hot turkey instead and never looked back. "
"Was in my car on my way home, cigarettes where empty. Go left to the gas station and buy a new box, or go right and go to bed. I went to bed.

Now, it was a spontaneous decision. But I got some good subconscious impulses, like seeing a woman I looked up at walking around with breathing tubes.

Your body is nicotine free in 4 days, so don't use the gum, it will only make the addiction last longer.

Edit: smoked 16 years, was 32 when I quit for 4 glorious years."
"I was a two pack a day smoker for 12 years.  One Sunday morning I woke up, hacked up a bunch of brown phlegm into the sink like I did every morning, got some coffee and had my first cigarette of the day with it.  About two thirds of the way into the cigarette I decided that I didn't want to smoke anymore.  I was tired of spending money on it, tired of coughing all the time, tired of the smell of old smoke.  So I put it out and became a non smoker.  

I got a giant bag of cheap suckers that helped me get through the first month or so.  I would eat a sucker when I drove or when I was on the computer to simulate that hand-to-mouth habit that smoking gave me.  "
It was a lot easier smoking the turkey when it was aflame.
"Put the cigarettes in the cold turkey, then eat the cold turkey."
"Found out I was pregnant. I didn't actually intend to quit cold turkey, I had planned to taper down from my half pack a day habit. But I couldn't bring myself to smoke knowing I wouldn't be the only one effected. Now I am a non smoker and can't fathom why I did that to myself for so many years. "
"Got an ulcer in my small intestine that got to the point it almost killed me. Smoking would of made it worse. I decided I didn't want to die. It was a pretty easy decision, but still a bitch. "
"I got really sick and was in the hospital for 3 weeks. When I got out I figured I was already over the hard part, so I might as well stop. I still have dreams where I smoke though, which is strange."
"My dad was a hard core smoker and quit many years ago.  I asked him recently how he did it and he said he did by eating these super strong mints. Had them in the truck, in his lunch kit  and always in shirt pocket. He said stronger the mints the better. Hope someone who reads this will try it and be successful"
Which brand of mints?
"Didn't buy another pack, asked the person that carpool with me not to smoke in my car. I'm going on 2 months now."
I've quit cold turkey many times. 
"Smoked a pack a day for almost 5 years, not counting all the drunk cigarettes for years prior. I tried to go for a run one day and couldn't make it to the end of the block. It was then that I decided to change up my methods of stress relief. I started cutting down to 10 a day, then 5 a day, then 0. Each week I tried to run for longer periods at a time. It really helped to fight the cravings and gave me a goal to work towards. Now I don't have any desire to go back."
"I only smoked for like a year, i quit about a month ago. I woke up one morning and couldn't take a deep breath. Felt like my lungs collapsed. So after that i havent had the urge to pick one up "
"Quit working in restaurants, it just came naturally after that"
Cold turkey.
Well I just stopped smoking and that was it. There were no cravings because I didn't rely on it for some sort of stimulating effect. Just don't rely on a substance like that or you'll have a bad time.
"""I don't have to quit smoking. I'm just not going to smoke today. I can buy a pack tomorrow if I still I want to."" Told myself that everyday until I didn't crave it anymore. "
"I was in college, couldn't afford it anymore. Had some classmates that knew I was trying to quit, so they would bitch at me if I ever picked up a smoke."
"Just did it one day. Decided I was tired of walking from class to class and being out of breath. Decided not to smoke one day and that was it. For two weeks I felt like shit (cold sweats, hard time sleeping, cold like symptoms etc.) but in the end it was for the better. The hardest part of it was the mental part. Like times and activities where you would usually have a cigarette during or after such as driving, eating, drinking was hard. I would get in my car and think I could light up a cig but remembered that I was quitting. That went on for a while then finally faded. If you push yourself you can do it."
Shrooms. 10 years smoking and one batch of tea and shrooms and I never touched one again. I guess while tripping I just decided I was done 
"I've never smoked but my cousin's husband (cousband?) did and quit cold turkey. My maternal family is full of odd but lifelong medical problems (cousin with childhood cancer, BMT, GVHS), my sister has Down syndrome, loads of cancer, etc. When our Gran was diagnosed with dementia he quit cold turkey because the magnitude of all these medical issues freaked him out and made him realize life is short and health runs out."
"I tried everything (chantix, patch, gum) for about a year and a half straight with no help. Finally I got a bad flu where I slept for like 2 days. I was too sick to smoke and didn't get out of bed. After 2 days I decided to keep going. 

After about a week I got better and by then I realized that I hadn't smoked in a week and the worst part of quitting was over, the first week. After a year and a half of trying to quit I knew that if I gave up that progress I would never quit. Every time I wanted a cigarette I told myself how long it had been and I would lose the progress I'd made. 

It's been about 14 months without a cigarette and I've got myself so afraid of losing my progress I have nightmares about it every now and then. Probably not the healthiest, mentally speaking, way to quit but I guess it's healthier than smoking."
Replaced it with running. 
"Always wanted to quit, ran out of money 3 days before payday, come payday figured I may as well continue to not smoke, that was February 2014"
"I got a horrible case of bronchitis and was laid up on the couch for two days. That was it, I'd finally had enough. 15 years, some time at two packs a day. Every time I wanted one I just thought about the pain, the money, the smell of my clothes, the nasty butts, the overflowing ashtrays, the discolored nails, the breath..  Pretty soon I just stopped wanting them."
"For me there was no trick, I just stopped. The withdrawal sucked but after a week or so I didn't think about smoking anymore. Then I noticed I could breathe better, food tasted better. Smelling cigarette smoke now makes me want to vomit."
"After you try smoking it heated up, its hard to go back, honestly."
"I wanted to quit for a while but it was hard. I caught a really bad cold and I spent 5 days smoking while NOT enjoying it, this pissed me off so much I just said fuck it and quit. I used Nicotine lozenges for the first 2 weeks. Haven't smoked in 6 years now. I miss smoking, I liked it, but I enjoy breathing better and I'll live longer for my kids. "
Only smoked for 3-4 months so it was easy.  Never smoked again. 11 years now.
"I quit cold turkey 6 weeks ago.  A pack of cigarettes cost $15 where I live, and I'm poor, so money. "
"My dad quit smoking while back. He told he he would stick his fingers down his throat whenever he would inhale in smoke. Now whenever he smells cigarette smoke he dry heaves. He told me is worked liked a charm, ""Drag and Gag"" method."
"I spent Saturday, Sunday, and Monday (took a day off) in bed and didn't leave my room unless necessary, so that I could make it through the first three days okay. Multiple quitting attempts had taught me that those were my make or break days.

Been cigarette free for almost 3 years now."
"It was 99% psychological for me.  I set the date about 2 weeks out.  Let myself smoke.  Had my last cigarette on my back porch at 2 or 3 am. Enjoyed it, had a nice goodbye smoke. Didn't tell anyone. At all. Just stopped.  Never bought more, never smoked again. I was a 1 to 1.5 pack a day, ADDICTED smoker. I jjust told myself no more, and stopped.  I had little kids that were my main motivation for quitting.  I didn;t want them to see my smoking and think it was okay."
"Got pregnant. Was an avid smoker for 8 years. About a week before I even peed on the stick I started getting nauseous whenever I tried to smoke, which quickly developed into nasuea whenever I was in the presence of cigarettes. My son is almost a year and I still can't be anywhere around smoke. "
"Smoked 1/2-3/4 pack of Parliament Lights a day. One day, after I had been sick with bronchitis and hadn't smoked for a day or two, I came into class and sat down next to a friend. He smelled HORRIBLE. I realized it was the smell of stale cigarettes and I decided then and there I didn't want to be stinky anymore. So I kicked it old school: Bought my absolute least favorite cigarettes on earth (Pall Mall, filterless if my memory serves), and smoked them all in a row. It took a pretty long time. I got sick like I had never been sick before. I never bought another pack of cigarettes, and over the past 10 years since that happened, I have smoked maybe 4 cigs total, all while black out drunk. 
EDIT: I still crave cigs sometimes, especially when I am under a lot of stress. Smoking is a door that once opened is hard to ever fully close, but I like to think I have done a pretty good job of it. I have also told others about this technique and it's helped them quit as well. It's unpleasant, but works wonders. I highly recommend it."
Sever back pain and Osteoporosis. Bones had to get to normal ranges before Dr would do surgery. Hurting really bad from most recent trip to Dr. 4 hrs away. Laid them down and didn't look back. Been almost 4 yrs. 
"I know this might sound dumb, but I eliminated the word ""try"".   I smoked for over 20 years and tried three or four times to quit, all without success.  One particular day, for some strange reason, every cigarette tasted like shit.  I was driving home that evening and something just came over me.  This was the last pack of cigarettes I will ever buy.  I smoked my last two, and that was it.  I quit.  After I made that decision, whenever someone asked is I wanted to have a smoke, instead of saying, ""I am trying to quit"", I would reply, ""I quit"".  I know it sounds dumb, but it made the difference.  Have not had one since May of 2002.   One other thing I did, I changed one habit that triggered a craving.  "
"What do you mean ""how""? I just stopped a couple months ago, wasn't really trying to. I never really smoked when I was at my house and I've been a complete shut-in lately so it just sort of happened. "
"Don't know if my method will work for anyone else but it worked great for me! 

Step 1- I spent the two weeks before my quit date looking up everything I could on smoking related diseases/deaths. I got it in my head that I will die violently and painfully if I don't quit. 

Step 2- I got violently drunk the night before quit date. I smoked the rest of my pack that night too which was way more than I usually smoked during a night of drinking. 

Step 3- woke up with massive hangover and smelling like an ash tray. 

Step 4- convinced myself that my hangover was due to smoking only. Basically I channeled all my pain into the belief that it was caused by smoking. If done right, you will be physically nauseous at the thought of having a cigarette. 

Step 5- threw away all my lighters. Put hurdles between you and lighting up again. 

I wss good for a week before the cravings started again, which brings me to my next trick- the air cigarette. Pretend your holding an imaginary cigarette between your fingers and pull a drag through them. Your brain will think your smoking and the craving will die. 
 
Eventually you become so proud of your progress that you will have control again when offered a cigarette in the future. "
"I simply stopped buying them. Was miserable for awhile, but it worked. Craving isn't something you can control, but it takes conscious effort to go to the store and buy a pack. I more quit buying them than quit smoking. I then just never had smokes to smoke. Eventually the cravings went away. (Smoked pack a day for ~6 years? Not as long as most I'm sure)"
I had a golf pencil I held like a cigarette.  Tapped it like I was flicking ash off it.  Sometimes even stuck it in my mouth.  Smoked for 18 years.  Two years smoke free.
Quitting is easy. I've done it lots of times.
"I don't smoke, but My Dad quit cold turkey.. I think 16 years ago. He said the thing with trying to quit smoking is most of the time people always say how they will have ""just one more"", or ""I'll only have this last one."" He said he never had ""just one more"". He just quit. He focused on other things. I know back then he was really big on building these airplanes you can fly through the air. So I think having something to focus on helps tremendously. 

You don't need one more though. "
I kept telling myself that I had just finished one. I kept doing it and kept doing it for so long that all of a sudden I had quit.
"I woke up the morning, after a long day of snowboarding and drinking the day before, with a nasty cold. Sore throat, aches, the whole 9. I decided that that was it, I was done smoking. I downloaded an app that keeps track of how long it had been since my last cigarette and told myself I wouldn't reset it, that having to reset the app would mean I had no self control. 

I'm at 3 years, 35 weeks, 2 days, 21 hours, 15ish minutes. I had nightmares about having a cigarette and the feeling of letting myself down. Never once reset the app and still have the occasional nightmare, but no cravings for cigarettes anymore."
"I consider myself to have quit cold turkey, because I didn't step down or taper my nicotine consumption. But, I *DID* radically alter my vehicle of administration with, of all things, snus. There's too much backstory to include here, but the bottom line is that I transitioned from a long-time, full-time smoker who had NEVER tried to quit before, to 3 weeks of exclusive snus use. If anything, I ingested far more nicotine during those three weeks than normal, but the onset of oral administration is delayed, and my addictive response started to weaken, while my lungs and sinuses cleared. Honestly, I more than once made myself sick with excess nicotine, but nevertheless the delayed gratification gave me ""breathing room"", and I started to imagine that I could succeed at quitting.

I'd never even tried to quit before, and I wasn't trying that time either, at the most I hoped I could switch my addiction to something less lethal than cigarettes. Three weeks later I was done, and 4.5 years later I'm still done. And that's the end of that story."
It was to tough to get it to light
Well. I had no money. And i wasnt about to ask people to buy me cigs. I hate being a bum/leech. So i quit. Been smoke free for about 2 years now
"I smoked for about 6 years but after countless bouts of bronchitis, I was tired of getting sick. I had almost quit 3 times previously but lapsed for one reason or another. 

Top things that helped me. 

Keeping 3 cigarettes on my desk to stare at while I played video games. It made me feel better having them there as I went through withdrawal. 

Instead of smoking on my lunch break, I used the money that I would piss away on cigarettes and buy a healthy and delicious lunch. It was nice to have disposable income for lunches. I was massively under weight while I smoked (6-4 and 165lbs).
 
Started exercising a bit and avoiding the most tempting locations for smoking (bars, clubs etc) for the first few months after quitting."
I pretty much woke up one day and wanted to go for a 1 mile run. I made it about 1/4 of the way and said I gotta stop smoking. So I quit plus prices were going up on them in Michigan. Started drinking more which I guess isn't the best of trade off but I still did it.
"Started smoking a little less each time. Bought stronger smokes that had a flavor I didn't like. They'd get stale, I'd forget what I was in this for. The biggest thing is to break routine. Your smoking is a routine as well as an addiction. One requires medication, one requires dedication."
"i made the realization that as an already lazy person, all i had to do was become slightly more lazy. that change of mind made it pretty easy to do, i had been smoking for roughly 5-7 years at that point and have not looked back"
"I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth pulled at the same time.  It was so painful to pucker up I couldn't smoke for 5 days.  I told myself if I could quit for 5 days, I could do it for 6.  Just one day at a time after that."
"sheer mental fortitude.  i told myself i would stop, and i did.  "
Jellybeans. Smoked for about 10 years. Almost a pack a day. One day I realized I fucking hated smoking. I tried to quit many times but the last time was cold turkey. That was about 8 years ago. Ate a shit tone of jellybeans though. Except the black ones. They're gross too.
Locked myself in a room laid on the couch and watched tv. Also whyquit. Com and the daily videos helped me.
"I started running. I decided I wanted to run a half-marathon so I started training for it. I was able to go cold turkey for a long time. I had a couple relapses (so I guess it doesn't fully count), but those relapses were one or two cigarettes when I was out drinking. It happened once a month or so. But then my runs would be noticeably harder. Eventually, I just stopped completely and now it's been months. I have zero desire to start again, even when I'm out drinking and see other people smoke. "
Anytime I quit anything I do I wait for a day that has significance. Quit on a friends birthday as a present to them. It will make you feel shit if you go back on it plus it will always give you a marker for how long it's been 
"Food and challenging myself by putting me in situations where I may cave with the sole purpose of not no matter how much I wanted to.

I also thought, it's  really just a month of nothing but craving anither cigarette and then a whole life of not smoking again."
"Wasn't a hardcore chain smoker for 15 years and so, only smoked for about 2 years. I went smoking one time and this girl I knew pretty was standing with a couple of people, and I went up and she said, ""hey rchae94 you smell like cigarettes, you should stop."" 

It wasn't condenscending at all (we always joked), but I decided to stop there. Cold turkey is only tough if you don't keep yourself occupied imo."
Just stop putting them in your mouth 
"I got to the point where I couldn't perform my job how I wanted to. When I was able to actually feel the physical effects of smoking, I put that shit down without thinking twice. 

Granted, I was never the guy that smoked because I felt like I needed to. I just did it because I enjoyed it and it was something to do.

But quitting wasn't really hard. You just need to find the right reason for you. As soon as you get that one idea in your head that becomes more important that smoking, that's all you need. "
"Pre-surgery; one last cigarette after decades of smoking - then nothing.  I knew I'd be so whacked out on pain meds - I wouldn't feel the withdrawal.  (Surgery scheduled wasn't something caused by smoking)  Eight years later, still get urges -- but would never dare."
"The thing I always recommend is quit for a week, then try to smoke a cigarette.

They taste like absolute shit.


I was smoking two packs of Reds a day and this is how I quit. 

Get sunflower seeds as well and replace that with the habit of smoking"
"its gonna sound wanky, but i just stopped. 

been smoking over 10 years and one day I ran out of smokes, it was 3am, so nowhere to get more and i just thought ""fuck it"" and havent had one since, first week was a hard but it was more the habit of going outside during work breaks and stuff that I found hard. 

Other than that, thats it... just occupied the mind with some other stuff...."
"pure, unadulterated rage.

pack a day smoker for 10-12 years. woke up one morning with a bad case of bronchitis. feverish, painful cough, the works. 

and i was low on smokes. fuck.

all i wanted out of life was to lay in bed and be miserable, but nooooooooooOOOooooooOOOooo. i hadda get up, get dressed, and drive down to the motherjumping store to buy more stupid cigarettes because i was addicted.

i felt like a slave and wasn't happy about it. worked myself up into such a lather that by the time i got to the CVS near my place to buy cigarettes, i bought some cold meds and a pint of ice cream instead. went home and hated life for a few days.

been good ever since."
"Try this. Every time you instinctively reach for a cigarette ask yourself this, ""do I really need/want to smoke it right now?""

Can you wait till later? Is there anything else to do?

Sure the answer may be yes sometimes but after a while you stop caring about smoking because you get bored of it.

Now I feel it's such a hassle to do.

I didn't ""quit"" smoking. I just eventually didn't want to anymore."
Sheer ignorant willpower. I just stopped and was too proud to fail. 
"Throw away all you paraphernalia. Ash trays, lights, matches, cellophane, everything needs to go. Take all your trash outside, clean everything. Remove the smell for anything that has it. 

Next, lock yourself inside for 3 days at least. Stock up on cinnamon candy, movies, and pesto bismal. Just lock yourself away from the world  Ifor you deink, avoid drinking and bars for a month.

The first eek is the hardest, after that it's really easy. Start working out too. Once you start getting into shape after smoking you won't want to go back. "
My brother-in-law quit cold turkey; he said he did it by visualizing himself as a non-smoker. Apparently that worked. 
I moved to a new city into a non smoking building where the only option is to go downstairs and outside to smoke. 
"Read Allan carr's *easy way to quite smoking* and haven't even considered smoking again. That ten dollar book was the best money I've ever spent. I was so blown away by how easy it actually was that I now buy that book where I find it used and have given it to literally every person I know who smokes. All of them quit cold turkey too. That book was literally life changing. If you smoke, go buy it."
"One day I woke up and I felt an odd tightness in my chest and it hurt every time I moved a certain way. This scared the living shit out of me and I never wanted to experience this feeling again. So in a way I'm not even sure if the smoking caused the chest pain though I assume that's what it was, that pain made me vow to not destroy my body anymore because I had big plans and never wanted to feel limited by smoking. I smoked once more when I was drunk three months later but besides that, that was the last time I ever smoked a cig. "
"I think you just have to find a reason that resonates with you.  It can't be because it's bad for you because you know it's bad for you and that obviously doesn't work.  It has nullified the part of your brain that cares about how bad it is for you.  It can't be for anyone else like a boyfriend or a wife or a child, because you will definitely relapse.  It has to be for you and it has to be for a reason other than the obvious reasons.

For me, it was finding out that Phillip Morris systematically destroyed indigenous populations in the amazon.  They go out there and employ natives for pennies a day and have them spray chemicals that are too strong to legally use in the US.  The get around the safety problem by saying they put a skull and cross bones symbol on them to make sure everyone (even those who can't speak English) know it's poison.  However, in their culture a skull and cross bones is a sign of the spirit and because the pesticides make the plants grow big and tall they spray it on their children to give them strength.  This is entirely wiped out many tribes and this just isn't stuff you hear about in the news because nobody cares about these people.  We don't and in the countries where they live they are usually considered bottom wrung citizens, so not even their own country cares enough to protect them from this kind of exploitation, and even encourages it sometimes.  Really fucking sad shit.  After hearing that I was able to quit cold turkey because fuck those assholes.  And you can go ahead and say you don't buy cigarettes from Phillip Morris...  mk.  But, if you smoke cigarettes and you're out and the only thing around is a Marlboro, you're gunna bum it and you're gunna smoke it.  If you don't smoke at all, it wont be an issue."
"This is kinda weird, but I ate a fair number of candy cigarettes (while by myself or with friends who knew I was quitting.) It was nice to have something to do with my hands and mouth. "
It was hard to smoke cold turkey. Damn cigarettes with cold turkey in them won't stay lit. So I quit. 
"I switched to e cigs, were on those for about a year. Went to Colorado once to visit family for a week or so, forgot my e cig, and surprisingly never had a craving the entire time I was there. Came home, started exercising regularly and haven't smoked a cig or e cig since. 

Edit: I would say I was a heavy smoker. At least a pack a day. Exercising helped the most. "
"Vaping. Instantly sold on the first puff, never wanted nasty burnt ass over fruity goodness again."
Got hypnotized & followed up with meditation. 
"Got real sick with a throat infection and ran out of cash. Thought to myself ""no better time than now""

That was about 4 weeks ago. Still going strong!"
"I have lots of thoughts on this, I finally quit for good almost ten years ago.  
1. You can't lament it.  Your can't sit around even for one second thinking about how much you miss it and  how much forever is going to suck without it.  You're doing it, now move the fuck on and aggressively pursue some healthy habits.  Channel that energy  into something positive.  Jog, box, do pushups, whatever.
2.  You absolutely can not have even one drag ever ever ever again.  No matter how far behind you it all seems, don't ever do it again.  Ever.  Know yourself.  Know that you are not one of those people who can have an occasional cigarette.  You're just not.  It's never an option again.  Not ever.
3.  To get through the first week give yourself permission to do absolutely anything (within reason) except smoke.  If you want scotch and McDonald's for every meal for a solid week, do that.  But don't smoke.  I'd you want to jerk off 6 times a day for the first week, do it.  But don't smoke.  If you want to go to home depot to buy yourself a bunch of dry wall to bring home to punch holes in every 15 minutes go right ahead.  Doing all of this for one week is far better than smoking for another  several years.  It just is.  Also, if you need a  shit load of time alone for that first week find a way to make it happen.  Do whatever it takes for one week, just don't smoke.
4. Find your own personal  asshole. Let me explain: This one asshole coworker of mine said to me when I'd quit around 2 weeks ""  you'll be smoking again in no time.""  This was the best thing anyone could have done for me.  I hated that fucking dick for saying that.  And I still think of him every time I want a cigarette, which  I'll admit isn't often anymore.  Fuck that guy, after he said that my resolve was incredibly strong.  No fucking way was I ever smoking again.  If there's some ass hole naysayer in your life use that energy you have that wants to strangle them, channel that into something positive and think of that prick every time you're tempted.   And know you  can do this.  Move the fuck on.  Get past this, you have your whole life ahead of you and it's just better without having to smoke all the time.

Now get it done."
"By vaping.  It's barely even quitting.  It's just smoking a different way.   Although it's switching one habit for another, vaping is much cleaner, healthier, and easier to put down than cigarettes.  "
I didn't even know smoking cold turkey was a thing...TIL
"One break at a time. One car ride at a time.

Whatever your triggers for smoking are, just don't do it *that time*. Don't think about the future or ""being a non-smoker."" Just focus on *now*. If I could go ten minutes, I could go an hour. If I could go an hour, I could go four hours. If I could go four hours, a whole day, and so on.

I smoked for about 16 years. I quit smoking eight years ago. "
Cinnamon dipped toothpicks 
"I met who I thought was the one. I didn't think there would be any way she would be with me if I smoked, so I quit. Then when we broke up, I picked up the habit again. Still waiting on the right one, I guess."
"I started warming it up first, cold turkey is good but warm turkey is great!"
"I was dumped by my girlfriend who was the one that originally got me to start smoking in the first place.

"
"It wasn't that hard, the key is wanting to stop."
Thought about it objectively and realized the only reason I continued to smoke was because I smoked. Once I understood how recursive the whole process was and that continuing to do so will undoubtedly be the death of me I found that the urge to not smoke was more powerful than the 5-10 minute craving episodes to smoke 
"My husband did when I told him that the cigarettes made his semen taste horrible enough to make me gag. So, there's some inspiration for ya, fellas."
"Since I wasnt working I jumped on my bike and rode, and rode. If I kept riding I couldnt stop for a smoke, and it also helped with the coughing and stuff once it hits you from quitting, since you can choke your lungs up while riding, and spit it all out."
"Constantly staying busy with something. Any idle moments in the first couple of days of quitting and you'll be right back to the pack.  
Also, something equally as important.  During that first week, avoiding anything or anybody that'll encourage you smoking.  For me, when I quit this last time (hopefully the final time), I could not drink booze, goto the bar, or see most of my friends considering they all pretty much smoke.  Any one of those scenarios would put me in fuck-it mode and i'd light up."
I stopped cold turkey and I started working out at the same time. Good way to evacuate my frustrations/stress.
"Research shows most people who quit successfully quit cold turkey. Success is defined as not using tobacco for at least one year after quitting. On average, those who are successful try seven times before attaining success, so you should expect setbacks.

Symptoms of physical addiction will subside almost entirely after three days. The next biggest problem is the habits: You answer the phone, you light up; you get in your car, you light up; you have a cup of coffee you light up. Find a way to change your habits: hold your phone in your other hand, or use a bluetooth earpiece; get your car detailed and/or let your SO drive; use/stop using cream and sugar in your coffee, or switch to tea or some other beverage.

What gets most people in the end is the psychological aspect. You've seen the old movie trope where the person who hasn't smoked for years suddenly starts again after some stressful life-changing event. That's not inaccurate. Smoking is a source of stress relief for most smokers, so when you get really stressed you'll feel an exceptionally strong urge to light up. The key is to have a plan in place, because you KNOW you will get stressed about something sometime in the future. 

Some ideas: Write a list of all the things you do that bring you joy. Decide that when you get stressed you will do everything on the list (or as much as practical) before lighting up. Make an agreement with someone you trust that you can call anytime who will help. Have a plan in place detailing how you will deal with the aftermath of a slip up. Many quitters who give in and have a smoke during a stressful period decide that's it, they're back to smoking. THAT'S NOT SO UNLESS YOU DECIDE IT'S SO! If you understand you will likely make mistakes and plan for them (reaffirm to yourself your commitment to quit; talk with someone who knows you are trying to quit to get some encouragement, be willing to start over, etc.) you don't have to give up ALL the gains you've made. Above all, understand each slip up is an opportunity to understand the kinds of situations that can trigger you to smoke and either avoid them, or have a plan to deal with them.

Send me a PM if you want; I'll help if I can.

Good luck!!! "
"I made the decision to quit and did it on the spot. That was over 20 years ago. I threw away the rest of my cigarettes and never asked for one or bought one again. The trap is when people say ""I'll quit when X happens"", or ""I'll quit on X particular day"". That shit never happens. People change their mind or forget they called out a particular day or event. Also, if you quit for anyone other than yourself, you're probably going to fail."
"I told myself everyday, many many times ""I am not a smoker, that is not who I am."" Perhaps sounds a bit weird to some people but helped me kick the habit."
Not a smoker but my dad was. He quit cold turkey when my brother ate a cigarette butt.
"A mix of exercise and thinking of having a stroke later in life every time I went out to have a cigarette. It was no longer relaxing or enjoyable after that, I couldn't get my mind off the fact what I was doing would leave half my body paralyzed. Now it's not a guarantee that would happen, of course, but it's a rational possibility. It ""helped"" that my own father had a stroke when I was in middle school, not related to smoking, so I had an idea of how fucked up a stroke is."
"I remember laying down in bed when I got woken up by a jolt and it was almost like losing conciousness for a second.  It was really quick.  I felt my blood vessels pound, my neck vessels especially.  Anyways, didn't really get it right away I just went back to sleep.

Couple of weeks go by and I get Medic Aid from Obama Care.  Pretty awesome to be honest, so I go to the local clinic and tell them about having shortness of breath and fast heart beating.  Well sure enough, high blood pressure.  I knew what that meant but even if they had told me I would have stopped smoking.  Anyways, once I found out I quit cold turkey.  

About a year goes by and I guess I've improved, and decide to see if I could handle a cigarette from a friend.  Nope, I cough because the smoke is hurting my lungs, and that's how I quit finally.  My lungs were almost back to normal and I took it from there.

However, I do sometimes want a cigarette.  See, when I would smoke I would go outside and be by myself usually late at night.  I live next to a canyon so I would love my time alone down there just listening to the night birds and watching the stars.  I still miss it, especially when it was raining.  I loved sitting down and watching the enviroment through puffs of smoke.  

I don't go outside anymore although I should.  It's just that, for some reason, smoking was an antisocial/social thing for me.  I wanted to be by myself, alone and being quiet looking at the night sky.  So I understand the allure of smoking.  I mean if you do it to look cool, or because everyone does it, then well I guess.  Although that is how it started for me.  It's just that now, I think about having high blood pressure again, or the fact that I donate plasma and it's my only source of income currently I don't want to ruin.  I also don't want cancer of course, so I have to shake my head whenever the thought of buying a pack crosses my mind.

So I wouldn't say I quit entirely, since I still feel the need of smoking just to smoke.  I just weigh the pros and cons and I just don't want cancer."
"I quit using chewing tobacco a few months back. I just decided I was done and wasn't gonna buy anymore. 

Finished the can I had left, and never bought another. I still get a craving sometimes, especially when it's out of habit - driving, playing golf, etc. 

I'll sometimes still reach for my back pocket like it's still there, but it's not. "
"I had switched to vaping for a month or so before I read a book by a man called Allan Carr. It worked a treat for me.

You will only quit when you want to."
Allen carrs guide to quit smoking and agmatine. 
"I smoked from ages 12 to 28. One day I smoked my last cigarette on the way home from work and forgot to pick up another pack. Before I realized it I had been without one for a few days. Been a little over two years now, and sometimes I even dream about smoking. "
"Been smoke free for about 4 years now and had been smoking for close to 10 years at about 1/2 a pack to a pack a day. Quit cold turkey one day when I just couldn't afford it anymore. I knew that it was going to be my last pack. I bought the soft peppermint sticks that you see a lot around Christmas time and munched on those as a craving hit. The stick hanging out of the mouth, for me, resembled a cigarette subconsciously and it really helped. "
Never stopped trying.. after 70+ attempts it worked like a charm..
"I've always wondered, is it actually *that hard* , or is it more of a having to adjust your life style as you get so used to living while incorporating smoking into your routine..?"
Quit as I graduated from college. Coiciding it with a huge life change helps. What helped the most was asking myself a question. Where does quitting smoking rank on the list of stuff you want to accomplish? Not very high. Then how the hell do you plan to accomplish the things high up on this list if you can't even do the little ones? Stopped cold turkey.
"Just decided I was done smoking. I told myself I wasn't addicted for years because ""I just buy packs, if I ever seriously consider buying a carton, I'll know I'm in too deep and I'll quit.""

Walked into Costco to buy a carton of Camel Turkish Silvers and went ""Nope. Fuck this. I'm out."" Bought a huge family sized pack of chewing gum. Chewed gum for a while, started exercising. 

Ran a triathlon a few years later, then started doing tough mudders and weight lifting. Just hit my body weight for my bench press 1rep max. 

I miss smoking. But holy shit do I love exercising. "
Smoking stale cigarettes got me off real quick
I went to basic training 
"Tried numerous times to quit without success.

Then I picked up a hobby where smoking would severely hinder my performance (in my case, cycling).

Loved going fast but sensed that smoking was holding me back. 

Haven't touched a ciggie for almost a year now. And gotten much faster."
Decided I was done. Quit right then & there. That's all there was to it. I've been smoke free for 16 years!
I went from a pack a day to none by just smoking weed when I had a craving 
blunts or a pipe? 
"Well I started noticing when I craved nicotine and then I said to myself if I want it this bad I need to be able to control it. So I made it a test of my will power, every time I felt it, I would sort of make it my enemy and resist it even more."
"Picked it up on deployment out of sheer boredom. Deployment ended, and said fuck it. Literally just like that"
Have a good reason! 
"Spent a week in hospital, confined to bed.
When I got out, I had lost the urge.

Knew from the first day that if I made it a whole week without a smoke, I would be off them for life.
I was a 20 cigs a day man.

Now I am ashamed of the money I literally burnt for 30 years.
"
"I ate sunflower seeds everytime I wanted a cigarette. Got addicted to them for a while, but it was a lot better than smoking."
"My dad was diagnosed with lung cancer at age of 47. He quit smoking the very day. It didn't take any effort. He was smoke free for about two years

However that was too late"
Had a friend whose mother was a chain smoker. Friend decided to douse the box in water then throw it in the freezer to try and stop her mum from smoking. It worked.
"A family friend died a painful and drawn out death from lung cancer, I quit the day after he died. Every time I think about smoking I think of Frank. "
[deleted]
*What are you talking about?! Quitting smoking is the easiest thing in the world! I do it 15 times a day!*
For me it was a mental thing. Smoking is doing something. So to stop smoking I don't even have to do anything. Results may vary. The most I smoked was like 3 for a year and half so I never considered myself a very heavy smoker.
"I just went somewhere where cigarettes were unavailable and instead of occupying myself with nicotine, I worked hard and made conversation with interesting people.

I did start smoking again, but they turned me on to smoking herbs and I have found that I can barely tolerate commercially available straight tobacco."
"How do you smoke something cold, wouldn't it have to be burning to smoke it."
"####**Stop fucking smoking.**

You want to smoke? Don't. Don't put yourself in positions where you can smoke, and stop buying cigarettes. Really it isn't that hard. You just have to stop fucking smoking.

Either that, or do a bunch of hookah until the thought of tobacco makes you nauseous."
"I smoked hand-rolled cigs for about a 6-8 month period. Never found the packaged ones very appealing. I generally smoked once a day, sometimes twice. One day I just started getting headaches after a drag or two, so I just stopped cold.

I suppose I hadn't smoked enough to develop any sort of addiction, so it was easy. Even if I were to have had a craving, the prospect of pain in the dome was good enough motivation to abstain."
