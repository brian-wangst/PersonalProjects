Postspoverty - in my early 20's I hit a rough patch and I had to choose smoking or eating.I'm glad you made the right choiceI usually just smoked hand-rolled to fight off the ravenous hunger I created for myself. I've definitely had the do I buy a pack of cigarettes or buy some food conundrum many time when I was smoking. It almost always ended with a pack of Newport 100s.[deleted]"Ugh, I still remember a time a few years ago when I had hit a really rough time. I didn't get paid for 4 days, and I literally only had ramen noodles to eat, which I was so sick of that I would go days without eating rather than suffer through that crap.

I ran out of cigs and tore my entire place apart. I went through every crevice looking for the slightest amount of change. After this I did the same in my car, then walked around the apartment looking for change. Took me 3 hours, but I managed to find $5 which I walked to the store with the buy some cigs. Sad that I just accepted not eating while going to such great lengthys to have a smoke. "That's what finally did it for my husband. He had been smoking for about 7 years until one day when we had all of 32 cents in our checking account. He hasn't bought a pack since. I'm very proud of him.In my early 20s I was picking butts and rolling refried cigarettes. It was pretty disgusting."This is how I got myself to quit.

>Do I want to eat? Or do I want a smoke?""I never got that bad, but sitting down and realizing my cigarette bill and my rent were both taking up 25% of my income did the trick.  I was great at living on the cheap except for one line item...""Could of just ate the cigarettes ya know, win-win situation."Addicted to food."I had to make a similar choice when I was around 19. Unfortunately I chose smoking over eating. I lost 60 lbs in 4 months. Still a smoker though. I made the wrong choice
""Choose between smoking or eating? You could never be a model. 

*eats bbq bacon cheeseburger*"I know many people who would choose the smokes... :/"This. The moment I had to choose between having lunch or buying a pack, that was when I stopped. Amazing how much money I wasted on that vice...""You didn't eat the cigarettes,  did you?"Started to eat the cigarettes. Brillant save Time and money I choose smoking over eating all the time you're comment makes feel stupid. "Similar story, except I just got fired and couldn't afford cigarettes OR food.  I had read about the master cleanse fast and decided that was the time to try it.

I had some nicotine patches left over from a previous quit attempt and wore them while fasting.  By day three, the nicotine was overwhelming me; I'd get dizzy and had to take the patch off.  Never smoked again.  Apparently the fast made me overly sensitive to the nicotine.

Funny thing was, I wasn't trying to quit, just get by until my last check arrived, but that was the quit that worked permanently."So... what did you choose??"I work with the low income population, and I have seen so many people make teh other choice.  ""I have no money, please give me food.""  However, they have a pack of cigarettes.  For some people it seems as ""necessary"" as rent.  ""I make $700 a month. My rent is $400, cigarettes are $150 so I only have $150 left over for everything else."" "One time I had to choose between dinner or cigarettes and I chose cigarettes."Dude, the exact same situation here.""Bleh, I justified the appetite suppressant effect as being cheaper than smoking. 

$7 to cut out two meals a day? Ok!

Then I learned to make cheaper food.""I was kinda broke too when I quit smoking, but after you factored in the increased need for groceries (since everything tastes AMAZING when you stop committing taste bud genocide), I don't think I came out much ahead."This is the exact reason why I'm quitting. Today is day 1 So you decided to eat the cigarettes?"Came here to say this.

I only quit due to lack of money and little willpower. Never ever smoking again."I wish this would work for my sister's husband. I'm constantly sending money their way and ordering pizza for her and her kids because they're so low on money lately. But they never have a shortage of Marlboro reds and Energy Drinks...."In college, my girlfriend lived with a girl who was getting a monthly student grant, which she would proceed to (without fail) blow within the first two weeks of the month. It would then pass that she would have to make a choice between food and cigarettes. She would choose cigarettes.
Was crazy.  ""I came here to say, money.

People are being taxed out. Not to mention some employers offer healthcare premium reductions.

That shit adds up fast, especially when something in the budget has to go!"Same here.? Why not just eat the tobacco then run to bring it to a burnLol im there now and im still choosing cigarettes :P"I was poor.  I had to decide between eating, smoking, or paying bills.  I chose smoking because it curbed my appetite and at the time was cheaper than eating.""""Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels""

"That was going to be my call too.Conformist!"Almost the same thing here,gave myself an ultimatum.i wanted a new truck but with smoking i wasnt going to be able to make the payments on it,so i had to choose : a new truck or blackened lungs. I love my truck and its been a year since i last smoked!"The Nicotrol Rough Patch.Solution: eat cigerettes"Yep, that's why I quit. Once I realized that I'd made the decision to eat rather than smoke (and I was smoking hand-rolled at the time anyways, couldn't even afford those) I just started working on a hatred for the things - I watched The Insider (great film, especially if you need a reason to hate Big Tobacco) and researched a bunch of facts on cigarettes online. "You should have compromised and ate your cigarettes"Money is a big factor, but I quit cold turkey after smoking for 8 years. I've been without a cigarette for almost 2 years now and I can't stand the smell of cigarettes. Just find a vice, mine is working out, along with changing your habits. If you usually go outside for a smoke on your lunch then stay inside. Just stay away from temptations. "Eat the cigarettes. Problem solved."Poverty for me, too. The winter electric bill came and I had no way to pay for it, so I quit smoking. I used the patch for a little while to give myself time to get past the habit before I worked on the nicotine addiction. I also quit with a friend and relied on my spiritual beliefs, both of which were helpful.

So, I guess it was the combination of peer support, spiritual internal coping, nicotine replacement, and being too broke to buy cigarettes. Quit 12 years this past November. "I did the same thing with WoW :(This is the only reason I have managed to give up for the last 3 weeksSo many time I chose smoking over eating...I just gave up fruit. Poverty is a treasure.I've chosen to smoke in that situation. "This right here, I had the same issue its been a little over a month now but yeah to choose between gas and food or smokes and food had to make a call."This will never work for me... I roll my own and pay <$10 a carton."Exact same thing happened to me, 21 here and i ran out of money. Only when you have no money does spending $6 every few days seem stupid."It's sad that I have chosen the smoking over food many times. It is terrible and silly in retrospect"I know choosing between cigs and food is a great way to lose weight, but this is a stop smoking thread.  ""So, you chose eating cigarettes? And you hit a rough nicotine patch?""Pussy, back in 'Nam I had to eat my cigarettes.""So, which one did you choose?""Fell in love with a girl who didn't smoke. Simple as that... I got self conscious about my breath and teeth and the smell of my clothes. I wanted her to want to kiss me all the time.

That, and she never pressured me to quit. She just said ""smoke or don't smoke, but quit acting like you want to stop and then buying more.""

Sometimes, I still have one when I'm really stressed. Finals week, etc. It's easy to stop there when you don't want to be a smoker anymore. I barely enjoy them now.""Yeah man exactly how I did it. 

The girl's gone now, but so are the cigarettes. I'm happy with that result.""I quit for a girl. Then a year later she broke my heart and my house got burglarized. Aaaaaaaaaand I started smoking again.


I have been vaping for the last 9 months and I think I'm done with ciggys."Man I'm a shit girlfriend. I want my boyfriend to quit so bad and I bug him to stop quite a bit...I need to lay off and let him do it in his own time."My girlfriend does smoke and I'm trying to quit. I haven't had one since yesterday, but I don't know how well this is gonna work out.""My story, exactly!  (Except I'm a girl and he's a boy.)  He never pressured me into anything and I think that propelled me into wanting to quit.  My ex would force me to stop smoking and that just made me want to smoke more."Same with my dad. He quit once my mom was pregnant with me. It worked out well because I didn't know he was a heavy smoker till 12 years later.Yeah I'm going thru that right now. She doesn't care if I smoke or not. But when I do it causes her to have coughing fits and I feel like a terrible person. I'm still struggling but I haven't bought a pack in weeks. "No judgement here - (I don't have a problem with people who smoke or anything), but I would say be a little careful with the ""very occasional smoke"" attitude...

As someone who used to smoke and doesn't anymore let me just say that for years I would smoke very occasionally, maybe at a bar with friends, or at stressful times, etc.
And a bit later, in a new city, I was regularly playing music with a bunch of people who smoked, and I'd occasionally bum a cigarette at practice. And feeling self conscious about always taking them from my friends, I started to buy packs again, though not regularly. But slowly it became more common, and I basically ""started smoking"" again.

I managed to catch it but I definitely found that the ""once in a while"" thing was, for me, not actually a good idea. I've properly quit for many years now (and now have a child, which I think really cemented it for me, though I'd already stopped by then).
Even now I still occasionally feel the urge in certain circumstances, especially after a couple of beers, especially with people who smoke..."[deleted]"Yup, for me it was my boyfriend who is now my husband. I only smoked for about a year+ a couple of months. Started on my 18th birthday and met him at 19. Having someone you really like pull away from kissing you abruptly because of the intense smell/taste of cigarettes is a REALLY good motivator to stop. He never started smoking because his mom used to say ""It's so stupid, and it looks stupid. Think about it. You're rolling up a bunch of dead grass, putting it in your mouth, and lighting it on fire!"" (Imagine saying that in a Bronx NY classic Italian mother's accent).   

But, at least in my case, quitting was easy because a) I had support from someone I truly liked and respected, and b) I'll occasionally (by that I mean once every 4~6 months) will smoke hookah (or the celebratory cigar) recreationally. It's something you can share with smoker and non-smoker friends alike.""I'm surprised you even would notice that. When I smoked I never knew my clothes would stink and my breath was bad.

It wasn't until after I quite smoking and would be next to someone who did, that it dawned on me that I must have stunk that bad. The smell on clothes was very powerful too. But I guess because I was used to the smoke, I would never notice it on me. "My girlfriend quit when we started dating. I love the hell out of her."Funny, my dear girlfriend who I have been with for almost two years has been a smoker since we met, and that's how I started.""Thanks for helping me to realize the inspiration I've needed! 
I met a girl about a year ago, and it's been getting fairly serious over the past couple months. I know she would love for me to quite, but hasn't really pressured me about it. 
I'm flying half way across the country to see her in a couple weeks. I think I've just found a pretty great Valentines Day gift."It's amazing how quickly we begin to care about things when you find something or someone you want to be with.Don't you find though that after not having one for a long time when you do it is the most awful tasting thing and you have a few puffs then put it out in disgust? I know I tried one after about a year of none and that is what I thought. are you my clone..."Man, you did it for a girl? You're going to spark up the moment you break up.""I have the opposite story. I am a girl and fell in love with my boyfriend, who doesn't smoke. He did not pressure me at all, but was very supportive when I was trying to cut down. He encouraged me, but didn't guilt trip me when I slipped. I didn't do cold turkey, I started with reducing to 10 cigs a day for a few days, then 7, then 5, then 3, then 1. I literally had a cigarette that I would only puff a couple of times from and then re-light it later. Slowly, i quit. I also got a new car and it really motivated me not to smoke while driving, which was probably the hardest challenge. ""When my fiance met me and we had gone on a 'date' or two, I straight up told him I wouldn't give him the time of day anymore unless he stopped.  He stopped.  ""I would like to commend you for that.  I recently dated a girl that smoked while drinking.  And every time she would drink then she'd get horny, and I couldn't stand to kiss her after and I asked her nicely many times to stop, and to not carry around cigs every where she went.  Neither happened and we broke up.""Same. I fell in love with my boyfriend, and no one in his family smoked. Whenever I would go out for one, and come into his moms place, she would politely ask me if I could just stand outside for a few minutes so that I don't smell of it. I became self concious, and I could tell that he didn't enjoy kissing me after I had one. 

People always told me that you need to quit for yourself. I never could. He was the only thing that made me want to. 5.5 years later, I made the right choice. :) ""I have a friend who smoked and has a gf, she told him ""its me or the smokes"" he ""quit"" and she found out by some well placed info. They are still together and I believe he quit for good now. ""That happened on both ends of the spectrum for me. If I was with a girl that smoked, I smoked. If she didn't, I didn't. But most of them did so whatever lol""Mine was similar.  First date with my now husband I was walking up with a cigarette hanging out of my mouth.  He said, ""Oh, you smoke.""  I put out the cigarette and said, ""Not any more.""  I had one more about a year later that was disgusting, but I finished.  I then had about 1/2 of another a few years later and put it out.  Frankly, I loved smoking, and now I think they are positively disgusting.""Good for you!

I wish my boyfriend was self-conscious about his breath and teeth.  Frankly, he doesn't care because he already has me.  I don't like kissing him. :(  

I told him to quit once and he snapped at me.  Haven't told him to quit again, but he knows I want him to.  He says he wants to, but who really knows. "I want a girl :( should i start smoking then quit "Similar story. I fell head over heels for a girl, and noticed that she had taken to smoking when she was around me. I realized then that either I had to quit, or she would start. We're no longer together, and I've since found out that she has again started smoking. It breaks my heart to think she unknowingly changed my life for the better and I can't return the favor...""Same here, partner didn't care either way but hated my being wishy washy about it. I still have one once in a while -bummed one on my birthday, had a drag of a friend's at a holiday party- but I don't really like the smell or get anything from it now, and it makes me feel like shit the next day.

I had to give up one of my favorite hobbies for a while though. I couldn't go to the bar and play pool without wanting to go have a cigarette between games with the rest of the pool playing folk. ""Similar story here. I met this girl last spring, long story short, I realized very quickly that I liked her a lot. She friend zoned me, but I couldn't help it, I still really liked her. I knew she hated smoking, so I never did it around her and always tried to cover up that I still smoked. I told myself that if anything ever did finally happen between us, I would just quit straight up. 

It finally happened just before Christmas. I love her very much and I haven't touched a cigarette since."My dad smoked a lot until he met my mom.  She didn't tell him to stop just that she didn't like the smell.  He's been cigarette free and married 25 years.  He still wakes up from time to time craving a smoke."As a chubby, pasty nerd obsessed with Middle-earth.....I might as well just start dating cigarettes. At least they don't judge me.""This is actually the reason why I won't start. I was about to pick it up, just to try it out and the sort. Met an amazing girl who absolutely hated smoking, made a promise to her that I wouldn't even try it. Working pretty well so far.""My husband still smokes. He keeps saying he is going to quit, 3 years in. I am anosmic (no sense of smell- at all), but he knows because of that I am super paranoid about me and my stuff smelling like smoke.  He is down to three a day, and has an ecig, but just refuses to let go.  I never pressured or even asked him to stop the first couple years, because when we first met he said he would be quitting in a ""couple years"". About a year ago I started asking him to stop. Not all the time, about once a month. We started rationing; he was doing 10-15 a day  (half of those straight after work shooting the shit with the guys; chefs) on his own, so we took it down to six at first, then every six weeks or so took one away. Got to 3 per day about five months ago and he refuses to go any lower, but I havent brought it up for a few months. 

It breaks my heart. I just wish he would stop already, but I know pressuring isnt thew ay to go about it.""> I barely enjoy them now.

That was the key for me.  One one of my last cigarettes, I sat there thinking ""I'm not really enjoying this anymore.""  I finished that pack and quit cold turkey.  4 years later, I still get small cravings, especially if I've been drinking or if I'm around smokers, but other than that I haven't looked back."Be careful not to fall into old habits with those finalsI can really relate to the easy to stop when you dont want to be a smoker part. I've always enjoyed other things like hookah smoke because it tastes good and I just enjoy smoking so one day I picked up cigs and just really didn't like it. Kept it up for like 8 months and just stopped randomly. A few months later I started again for a while and stopped. Getting an ecig cut the few months on and off cycle because I can still play with the and have something that tastes good.Okay... Just realized I am smoking while reading this thread. Than your comment was the only one to get to me... I want my gf to want to kiss me too. :("> Fell in love with a girl who didn't smoke. Simple as that...

But if you'd stick with doing anal, she wouldn't smell you anyway, silly sir. Too bad you never thought about that. I'm sure your sorry now.""So - for those weighing their options between falling in love or getting an ecig, where do you find a girl for $35 online?""My boyfriend told me that he used to smoke and I didn't want to be the reason why he began again, so I quit. It's been 6 months. I've struggled a lot, but he's worth it. 

However, if we ever break up, I have a feeling I'd probably buy a pack immediately. "This is actually really cute and inspirational. I wish my partner would do the same :("My boyfriend says he quit for me, but I didn't pressure him to. When I was 12, my mother died of lung cancer caused by a lifetime of smoking. It was hard for me to see my boyfriend smoke, but I never complained or told him he had to quit. After we'd been dating for about 6 months I finally got up the courage to say I was afraid of something happening to him. He said he had been waiting for me to say something about it. He threw out his cigarettes that night and hasn't smoked since. He said it was realizing he had someone in his life who he didn't want to hurt gave him the strength to quit. ""I started dating someone who didn't smoke and hated the taste, urging me to do the same. A year later I had successfully quit and she had started up :( I still don't know how or why that happened. Breaks my heart watching her spark up ""I quit for a girl also. 

I was trying to be healthy with what i ate and everything too, but really I just didn't want her to know that I hadn't quit after two years. Esp when trying to eat healthy and be a better person. 

I bought a pack when things got rough with her, both out of spite and to have a crutch, but they weren't the same and I knew I didn't want to start again. ""My mom got my dad to quit smoking by betting him that he couldn't. He finished the cigarette he was smoking and then quit cold turkey. My mom quit, too. Would be a pretty adorable story except they both started smoking again when they got divorced. ""I'm not in love, but same deal. I didn't want to smell or have awful breath around him because he was a pretty straight edge guy (with drinking being the exception). I never really felt addicted though, like I HAD to have one. It was when I was bored or needed to think.""My bf is currently going through thid with me for the second time. The first, we had a pack-a-day smoker roommate and that made it impossible. I reassured him that if he was ready to quit it would be for him and I'd support him either way.

He'll get there when he's ready, just like you were.""Dude, don't have the one for ""stress"".  It doesn't help you cope with stress.  Stop that."I wish that worked for my boyfriend. He's trying :( I never pressure him but it *really* bothers me in a lot of ways. I watched my grandfather die (and watched my grandmother watch him die) due to emphysema and it's something I never want to go through.My husband quit because I told him when we met that I wouldn't date a smoker. "so that's kind of interesting. I fell in love with a girl who didn't smoke, but always begged me to quit. after 3 or so years with her I finally did (after many times explaining that her being so persistent didnt help matters) I quit. when we broke up, I immediately started chain smoking (probably mostly because she asked me not to and I was petty about it.) I finally quit for real when I actually got over her, which was around the time I realized I wanted to be awesome by my own account, not by anyone else's""Came here to say this. Problem is though, is that unlike some other people here, if we broke up I would probably go right back to it. Don't think that's going to happen though (no jinxies). ""That's sweet.

The only time I've dated a chain smoker I got ""If you bug me about smoking, or try to get me to quit, I'll break up with you"" very early on in the relationship :/""This exact reason is how I see myself quitting. Once I meet my girl I'm done. I've quit many times unsuccessfully before so I'm very confident I'll be able to do it. Until then.... I guess I'll just be another typical smoker, *shrugs*""I gotta buddy that's doing the same thing and I don't even think he knows it! We've been on him to quit for years but he just keeps on puffing. Now that he's not smoking near as much, we're all keeping quiet and hoping it sticks haha. ""I had a girl, that pressured me all the time and that just made me want to smoke more. Or even hide the fact I was smoking, that being said pressuring someone is not the way to go when you want someone to quit.""This is a real thing -- you can cut waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyy back. For me, it was easier to never announce I was quitting, but just sort of procrastinate that next stress cigarette.""> It's easy to stop there when you don't want to be a smoker anymore. I barely enjoy them now.

Well said. "And the girl? What happened to here? Was it worth it?"I've wanted to quit forever, I'm currently using non-smoking new girlfriend as an excuse.

EDIT: One week in exactly actually.  Now I just need to kick the nicotine gum and E-cigs""That's exactly my story but like you i do occasionally have one here and there... I would say i smoke now maybe 6,7 times a year.. Pretty good who use to be cartons lol""Crazy, I almost started because of a girl...we just kind of bonded over smoking tobacco and that was our thing.""If you still smoke, you didn't quit."Electronic cig i'm still using it but am now down to no nicotine in it. I haven't had a cig in almost 3 years. "Well done, I'm at about 6 months, still higher nic, but hoping to drop soon"This is the ticket right here. There is absolutely no way that these will not replace every other nicotine replace therapy device in the next decade or sooner."I bought the really nice one for $120 with oil and such in June of last year. After a month, I stopped craving nicotine and found out my addiction was to the ""feel"" of the smoke in my throat. The vapor gave me the same sensation. Now, I dont even crave THAT! Smoke free ever since 
"nice on the 3 years! Im at a little over 6 months now and have started lowering my nic level. OP you can step over here to [this sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/) if youd like some good information about electronic cigarettes "I really think its ridiculous (and disappointing) that this or any other comment related to e-cigs isn't the top comment, and never is on these smoking threads.  So many people just don't even know about these things, I really wish more people knew about the good ones and/or never came across the bullshit little 7-11/gas station e-cigs that turn people off of them.

4 years e-cig user, went from a pack a day to zero, overnight. ;)""Congrats!! I've been off cigs entirely for 10 months now using an e-cig and next week I'm stepping down to 0 nic, too. I started at 36 and have been doing a gradual reduction, I'm so happy to be at the finish line."Been hovering around 6-0mg nicotine for about 10 months now. I'm at the point where I can leave it alone all day and not really think about it."This.

Start off with a Blu e-cig that you can buy at 7-11 so you have no excuses like running out - you can get them whenever you have a craving. You'll quickly realize that they don't last very long and are very expensive, so immediately start looking into other options. Look online, or at your local tobacconist. Some people like no-hassle solutions like White Cloud or V2 e-cigs, where you just recharge the battery and replace the pre-filled cartridges when they run out. I don't. I would recommend a starter kit like an eGo or an eVod that lets you fill your own cartridges with a juice of your choice. I like the Vapor Zeus from Vapor4Life. When you're ready, you can then step up to mechanical mods, where you're recharging batteries, filling your own tanks, and rebuilding your own atomizers. The point is that it becomes less and less expensive, and you'll figure out how to get a quality vape that you really enjoy. The world of vaping and e-cigs can be very confusing - just keep doing your research and you'll learn it all in time.

The important thing is to just start down the path. Quit now. You'll be happy and proud that you did.

Edit: Congrats, rottdog. And OP - the key is to keep trying until you find an e-cig that you like *better* than analogs. Good luck - you can do this."Just hit my one-year anniversary. =) Ecigs are the only things that worked after 15 years of smoking.Electronic were my savior for quitting as well.  27 years of smoking and its been almost 3 years since my last cigarette.  A couple of months of electronic cigs(I had a nice ego setup) and I just burned out on it and never looked back.  Feels absolutely wonderful.  The first time I ran up my stairs and thought about the fact that I wasn't breathing heavily just brought the biggest smile to my face."I never planned on quitting, I just wanted to try these things out. Ordered my first one from a website 3 years ago and about 6 months in finally said ""why am I still smoking analogues?"". 

I like my nicotine though, sitting happy at 24mg/ml."Its been working so well for me. Haven't had a cigarette since new years day. I know it's not 3 years but it feels good"I came in here to say this. Stopped smoking almost 6 months ago. E-cigs are amazing. I wake up feeling great every morning and I can still get nicotine, as I'm slowly moving down in mg. ""ecigs did it for me too, almost 2 years without a regular cigarette.""Agreed. Haven't had a cig in over a year. 

Some might say that you're not really quitting if you're using an electronic cigarette. Sure, from a semantics standpoint that's correct. From a health perspective, it couldn't be further from the truth. 

Also, I've weaned myself off nicotine over the past year and have myself controlled to the point where I don't really use my e-cig unless I'm drinking (in which case I vape like a mad-man). Cheating you say? I've seen far too many friends pick back up the habit during a get-together/binge...I'm simply being realistic with myself. ""These are just amazing. My sister, her husband, her mother-in-law, and my cousin all quit overnight using e-cigs. It was so effortless and they were all heavy smokers. Once they saw how well it worked for my sister, pretty much everyone in our immediate circle that smokes swapped over to the e-cig and they love it way more than they ever loved cigarettes. "That's the route I'm slowly working towardsGot my first ecig I July and haven't had a cigarette since. Hopefully I'll also get down to zero nic eventually. "E-cigs helped me, too.

I am a serial quitter. Smoke, quit, smoke, quit. I've quit cold turkey, used patches... When I started vaping, it was natural to break habits.

I used cigarettes in conjunction with vaping at first, then when my pack as gone, I just stuck with vaping. As my taste buds returned and I got the sore throat and coughing, I started using it less and less - only as needed instead of socially. Those cravings faded, too. I carried it around with me unused for almost a year and only ditched it when I bought myself a new purse."I used the pen like vaporizer for six months. Starting at high nicotine level and stepping down every few weeks till I hit zero. From there a week latet it felt pointless. "In did the same thing.  I just dropped the nicotine content each time I ordered more juice.  After a month or two at 0 nicotine, I stopped vaping entirely.  It took about a year overall to kick smoking."I get shortness of breath after most hits on my vape. I was told I could be using too much nicotine.  I cut it down to 6 and still the same effect. I was also told some have a small reaction to the pg in the liquids so im going to order 100%vg and see if that helps. If not im going to have to try something new all together. Same.  Am at 20mg nic now but I haven't picked up an actual cigarette since I got the unit.  The best part was just knowing how things actually smell and taste.   "They are helping a lot in France, and there's a specialized store every corner (ok, like two or three in a small neighborhood). You reached no nicotine, it's great, congratulations!"I bought a good one but i havent found a single juice that is pleasant for more than the first puff. Horrible aftertaste or leaving my throat sore.E-cig gets it done. But I wonder what health effects it has? Not sure if any study's or test have been done? With the FDA and so on.I'm down to 16mg/ml. next bottle I'll probably go down to 10 or 12. Fun fact: nicotine contributes to atherosclerosis!Where do you buy them without the nicotine? The only ones i've seen have the little cart in them."Twist: ""rottdog"" is Leonardo DiCaprioå«s reddit username 

"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.5908767072+ years here myself..vape on!Congrats! I couldn't make that last step to zero.5 months now for me @ 0mg. Same here.  Only took me 3 weeks and then I was able to ditch it (the e cig) as well.  It ended up being way easier than I expected it to be.  My guess is that for me it was more a bad habit and less of a chemical addiction.  I smoked a pack a day for 15 years prior to quitting."Same here but with weed, smoked it for 14 years and now I just use flavored ejuice without nicotine. It's not the same but it's better for my health"I quit chewing tobacco with e-cigs about 3 months ago. Started with the evod starter kit with high nicotine content. Just this week I got all the stuff to make my own liquid. Which I'm excited about cause I play around with lower nicotine and flavors. And it's very cheap. I can make 30ml for about a dollar. Got the liquid stuff at http://www.wizardlabs.us/."congrats. Im about 5 months off cigs/chew, and my lungs and mouth are happier. Im down to 6mg but from 18 thats a big jump ha""Nice!  I quit with an ecig 4+ years ago.  I tried numerous times before that and succeeded for up to 6 or 7 months, but the ecig is what finally did it."Were ecigs available 3 years ago?Did the same. Its been about a year.I just recently got one to try and curb the cravings. Best investment I ever made.I got to this point in about 1.5 years and then just stopped using it one day."My parents smoked a pack a day or more for 50 and 40 years, respectively. Then I got them ecigs, and told them I'd buy them cartridges from now on if they would just smoke these instead. They started smoking them and never looked back. I definitely recommend these to anyone wanting to quit."Electronic punctuation as well I take it?"Same! I'm almost at two years since I stopped using even the e-cig! Though I have the occasional hookah session, it is not addicting and doesn't have as many chemicals. ""Former 15 year pack-a-day smoker here. I'll second the e-cigs. Start with 18-24mg juice, though. I've got friends that gave up on e-cigs because the 6mg juice didn't satisfy any cravings. The company I work for decided to charge smokers an extra $100 per month for health insurance, and in the span of a month, the majority of the people I smoked with outside the building switched to e-cigs (myself included.) Many of us have even quit vaping completely, and only a couple have gone back to the coffin nails. I'm down to 6mg juice, and should be making the switch to nicotine-free juice in a couple weeks. I've been vaping since September 23, and am tobacco free since September 25."Is that completely healthy or are there still some slight adverse effects?Are there any particular brands/makes of electronic cigarettes that stand out from the pack?The electronic cig worked for me too! I started at the highest and then got ones with less and less nicotine. I wasn't even to the no nicotine when I literally forgot about smoking. Having a non smoker for support helps also. "Same here,  converted all our friends over. "I'm curious why you're still using it with no nicotine.  Do you plan on stopping altogether at some point?I'm looking into getting one. What one do you recommend?"I have to quit in less than a month for a surgery I'm having. And I can't smoke EVER after the surgery. This means no nicotine. I'm fucking freaking out. I had a quit date already set in my brain, I was ready for it. But now it's pushed up almost 5 months. 

Not to mention I have to quit caffeine and carbonated drinks (DIET COKE NOOOOO).

I have an e-cig, but I guess I need to throw out my carton of cigarettes and get some low dose and zero nic cartridges. ""hey how does that thing affect your lungs?
and does the nicotine free kind have a different effect?
also, what kind of juice are you vaping?""Came here to say this. The best thing is my smoker's cough is gone and I no longer wheeze. Victory, at last.""Fuck people who say it doesn't work. I have tried to quit at least 10 times through other methods.

Went straight from smoking to nicotine free ecigs.

In one month, I went from 10 a day to zero, and now I haven't had an ecig in over 6 weeks.

Just ran 3k on a treadmill. I couldn't even do that when I was 16."How has this not been upvoted more?"My friend was down to low nicotine but didn't want to drop to nicotine free because he said he would have to suffer withdrawals and it would be too hard. I switched his cartridges without telling him and after 2 weeks let him know that he was now nicotine free. 

I guess placebo effect trumped nicotine withdrawal.""Quick questions: If you have no nicotine in it, then why do you still use it?
Are there any other benifits to them like taste?""I'm not sure about how true this is, but I have heard that e-cigs are just as destructive as regular cigarettes. ""It's still smoking and you are still an addict, but you aren't hurting anyone else or damaging your health. So good on you friend :)

I wish 100% of smokers who can't quit would switch to E-cigs. Just for the rest of us who can't stand smelling them."Glad you found a new addiction to waste money on. "I knew I had to quit. My young son was getting older and was very aware. I kept putting it off because smokers are great at that. Then one day my 2 year old picked someone's grubby old butt up off the ground, put it in his mouth and said ""Look Daddy. I'm smoking too"". Heartbreaking. I quit cold turkey the next day.

So the moral of my story is that having a really great reason to quit smoking that means a lot to you is important.

Edit: Thanks for the gold anonymous friend. Thanks everyone for your great stories. I'm enjoying them all."My father quit when he saw me drag on a crayon..."I think my father quit for the same reason, although I was too young to know for sure. 

I think what happened is one day when I was about 7-8 I decided to smoke like my dad did. He left them in the living room beside the astray. Only thing is I saw him walking up the street before I was done so I just put it out. He ended up seeing a half unsmoked cigarette put out in his astray.

That's the last memory related to my father smoking that I have though. Since then I have probably had 5 cigarettes (I'm 28 now), just never had the desire but I can see how easy it is to begin."Exactly what happened to my grandfather. He saw my cousin who was seven at the time pick up one of his cigarettes and put it in his mouth. My grandfather snatched it up from him and took the pack and threw it away. Quit cold turkey just like that. Similar for me. Wife was pregnant with our first child and the thought of something like that got me to quit. I would still cheat every once in a while when I went to the bars. Now that is not an issue for me since they banned smoking in bars. "I'm not a smoker but I have a young son and dammit just imagining this makes me so sad.

I'm glad you quit.""I had asthma, severe asthma, I had to go to the hospital 3 to 8 times a day from when I was born until I was 4. I lived in a small town, maybe 20000 people, I went so much I could walk into the room and get my own treatment going while my parents checked me in. They finally said the only thing it could have been was my dad's smoking, he hasn't smoked since than... 20+ years"I'm a shallow bastard....I quit for the $$$"Good for you. Your son will be happy to have his father around for years to come now! Plus, you'll always be able to tell him he's the reason you quit.""It really does just boil down to having a good enough reason to quit.  You have to truly want it badly enough to endure the misery that is the quitting process.  No pill, patch, or e-cigarette can substitute for the willpower that is needed.  Cold turkey worked for me because I had reached my tipping point; I was tired of feeling the way I did as a smoker.""I think it was my persistent nagging as a kid to get my parents to stop - that was like 30 years ago, so I figure I done well (so have you!)"This is heartbreaking but inspirational. You're a great person and a wonderful parent."This the exact reason I quit smoking too, well sub son for daughter. 
I quit cold turkey over 3 years ago for the person I love.""My girlfriend is pregnant right now. I can't imagine my life with out tobacco, but I also can't imagine picking up my newborn and reeking of smoke. My baby will smell like cigarettes instead of baby."Thats a very respectable thing to do!"My dad quit when I was born but started again two years later when he and my mom divorced.  Now that my youngest sibling is 18 and about to go to college, I feel like he has no strong reasons like that left to quit :(."that'll do it "Did the same when my girl told me she was pregnant. The little fella turned 6 months recently and changed my life more than one can describe. the loss of the habit of smoking is the icing on the cake. 
Smoking sucks... "">Then one day my 2 year old picked someone's grubby old butt up off the ground, put it in his mouth 

That's the *exact* same thing that happened to my brother. He threw them away that night and never smoked again."When the fear of loss becomes greater than the joy of smoking...you'll quit. All the stories on here will confirm. My wife quit. She wouldn't kiss me because I smoked. I quit the next day. I can't go my entire life without any lovin! Good luck to all those still struggling. It's been 7 years. I never even think about it. Kids will do it. Mine was pregnancy. I quit and because of breastfeeding didn't pick it back up. Kids make u less selfish it seems. "i was afraid the top post here would be something along these lines.

 it seems children (your own) are one of the few things worth while that make everything else seem trivially unimportant by comparison - they are important enough to give you the strength to quit a habit like smoking.

second in line is probably a significant other that wishes you would stop smoking. and i doubt this is a strong enough incentive, either.

so what would be a powerful enough driver for the rest of us who are single and have no kids? probably it's when your health simply demands it, and even then it would still be very hard to quit and probably too late already.""I have a similar story, but from a child's perspective.

When I was in elementary school, I was going through the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), and realized that what my mother had been doing could possibly kill her and it was hurting me too. So, my plan of action was to crush her cigarettes into mush and dump them in the trash every time I found her packs. Eventually, she gave up buying them and trying to hide them because she realized what I was doing was good for her, would save money, and she hasn't smoked since. It's been over twelve years."My parents didn't quit for me :( Now I feel bad. "In pharmacy school I used to run smoking cessation classes.  I had patients on NRT (nicotine replacement therapy), buproprion (Zyban), e-cigarettes (technically not a true quitting agent), and Chantix.  Some of my patients were ex-cocaine and heroin addicts which they claimed was easier to give up than smoking.  Out of this, the most success I had with getting people to quit was in pregnant women, or people with children going cold turkey.  The risk of harming your child is a powerful motivator.

TL;DR: wanna quit smoking?  Start making babies ""Honestly, you're a great parent. My mom smokes to this day, despite me doing things like that throughout my childhood. I actually started smoking when I was 14, I would steal her cigarettes.
Then when I was 21, my boyfriend found out he had cancer. He's cancer free now, so no worries! But the type of cancer he had was genetic. It happened at the chromosomal level, and he really didn't have a choice in the matter. By smoking,  I was making the choice to possibly put myself in the same position. I just couldn't justify doing that to him or myself, knowing the risks. ""Thank you. My father died of cancer when I was 23 (and my little brother was 16). It was heartbreaking. He was a heavy smoker and drinker up until I was born, but you've definitely cut down your chances of having your son lose his father. Word of advice - don't be paranoid, but be proactive about getting regular checkups, and getting things investigated quickly if you start having unusual symptoms."Hijacking top comment to commend /r/stopsmoking to you and anyone else who wants to quit. Strongest support I've ever gotten on the internet!"Reminded me of this PSA that I remember seeing often in the early 70s:

[Like Father Like Son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA1QxJatWng)

Good on you for quitting!
""My Grandmother did the same thing. She had been smoking way before any of us grandchildren were born and didn't seem to be thinking of quitting. She was super careful not to smoke in front of us as best as she could, but we would still see her sometimes. Well, she had the ashtray on the patio table and one of my littler cousins picked out a butt and went up to grandma smiling saying ""I can do it too!"". Grandmother gasped threw her carton right in the trash along with all the ashtrays, said ""Grandma has been doing a bad thing"" and never smoked again. ""Similar story. My 9 year old daughter asked if she could have a cigarette. And this was after I had gone to great lengths hiding my smoking from her as best as I could. I never smoked in front of her, but I guess she figured out why the car smelled funny and why I was going outside every hour or so for 10 minutes.

Quitting cold turkey was the only thing that worked. It was three days of pure hell but after that it was okay. Patches were too much hassle and you get addicted to the rush that a fresh patch can bring. Chantix is way too dangerous, had two friends almost die from side effects.
"Wish that was enough for my dad. He is starting to slow down and has issues breathing. He is also getting that phloemy sound when he coughs too. We know all the warning signs because both sides of my family are all dying from smoking."I just had my first daughter ten days ago.  I haven't had a cigarette since, after 10 years of smoking a pack a day.  Sometimes it just takes a little motivation.""I totally agree with this.. Find a great reason to quit, stick to it and think about it each time you feel like lighting one. I quit after 10 years. I was about to get married, and realized If I didn't quit I might not see my kids grow up. I woke up one day, smoke my regular morning cigarette and it was my last cigarette ever, Cold Turkey.""My dad managed to quit...two weeks before he died of lung cancer he was too weak to lift a cig.  At age 56.

Sigh.""I wish my father had quit. He's still alive, but his health is so bad he misses out on a lot of stuff. One of the reasons his health is so bad is because he won't stop smoking; it compounds his heart problems, makes it hard for him to recover after surgery, makes him less active. He missed my graduation. He probably won't walk me down the aisle for my wedding. I doubt he will see his first grandchildren.""That's almost exactly what happened with my son, and why I quit too, except it was ""look mommy"". ""I know this is just another story but, my mom quit when I came home from kindergarten and had a ziploc bag with black construction paper, and I blew into it saying, ""Mommy these are your lungs""""I Quit for my kids, too. One day, My kids and I were all playing outside, and my daughter asked me to push her on the swing hanging from our tree in the front yard. I told her to hold on a bit... so I could finish my cigarette...for some reason, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I went inside for a bit, because I couldn't stop the tears from coming. I thought ""How could I?... they deserve better."" I quit the next day. I just forced myself to. You have to Really truly want to. bottom line. 

Edit: It has been almost 5 years since my last cigarette. ""That's one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever heard. As a smoker in the process of quitting with a young son, I appreciate this story. 2 weeks smoke free!!!!""My father was taking me on a fishing trip. It was the first time I'd seen him since I was a baby. I think I was seven and I was too terrified to even speak to him unless first having been spoken to. This was in the eighties. Without giving it a second thought, he cracked open a beer on the way to the river. I watched him take a big swig. When he went to put it in the cup holder he saw me staring up at him like I knew it was wrong. I did but I didn't... He immediately got this overwhelming look of guilt over his face, then let out a sigh and begrudgingly slowed the car down, rolled his window down, and threw the beer as hard as he could across the road into the woods. The only thing I could think about after that was how terrible it was for him to litter like that. As far as I know, besides my late grandfather's famous eggnog during the holidays, he hasn't touched alcohol. 

I remember when I was four I was home alone with my stepfather. I was incredibly thirsty but I wasn't tall enough to reach the faucet in the kitchen. I didn't want to move the chair to the sink because it would have made too much noise. I walked into the living room where my stepfather was passed out on the couch. His lukewarm Budweiser was sitting on the coffee table almost completely full. I picked it up, took a drink, then almost vomited as it burned my throat. I went to bed crying and even more thirsty. 

I remember always wondering what that pungent smell was when he came around. It wasn't beer and it wasn't cigarettes, but it was always in the air. I learned later exactly what that smell was the first time I smoked cannabis. It was so nostalgic.

I remember coming back home from the fair late one night and wondering why there was a lit candle with a spoon and a needle next to it under the naked lady lamp. 

Looking back at all the encounters over my young life, and then remembering all the things I did myself as a teenager, it's a miracle I'm not either dead or in prison. I'm serious when I say Fear and Loathing doesn't compare to my life.""This. My parents quit smoking after 40 years cold turkey, all because they started fostering and in the UK anyway, they will not place a child in a home where someone smokes. No exceptions. My mum says all the time that the only way she stopped and has kept on the wagon is that she has a non-flexible, concrete reason to. If she smokes she can't foster, and that's pretty much it.

Everyone knows it's terrible for you, it's expensive and will undoubtedly kill you, but if it was that simple no-one would do it. I think you need to find a good enough personal reason to stop or it just won't work. (Still looking for mine haha)""When I was about 6 I asked my mother when I would be going to live with my aunt. When she asked why I would go live with my aunt, I told her that I learned that smoking kills you and so I knew I would have to live with my aunt soon. She quit smoking. :)""You're a great father, wish mine would do the same. Maybe as his 22 year old son I'll do what your son did lol.

But really I fucking hate cigarettes. I've told him multiple times in the past to quit, and he's tried several but after a month or so falls back into it. I guess I just don't understand addiction, like when I want to quit a habit I do, it's never easy but it's not impossible either. I wish I could help my dad :/"Cold turkey is the best way to go. Just get through the first three days off hell and you'll be fine."Nice story, but producing children and waiting 2 years is hardly a good method for everyone :D"This is what got my father to quit chewing.[deleted]I completely agree with you. I quit smoking the day my daughter was born. It is 5 years 3 months now. You have to associate it with something more important than smoking."A friend of my father's had a very similar story. He had been chain smoking since he was 15. When he was 40, he once saw his 7 year-old son pretend to be smoking a pretzel stick. He put out his cigarette and hasn't smoked one since. It's been about 15 years now."Crazy how kids can impact an addiction like that. When I was very young (4 or 5) I remember telling my mother that she needed to stop smoking. She also quit cold turkey the next day. "I smoked for three years and, like you, knew I needed to quit before I got married, had kids, etc.  During my first year of teaching, I had just had a conversation with my boyfriend's family about my grandmother who was also a teacher. But the thing was, I never met my grandmother.  I had heard my entire life that she was a wonderful woman, mother, and wife. She passed away when my dad was only 26 from lung cancer.  Not having a great relationship with my other grandmother, I always wondered if I would have had a really great one with her. 

While driving home that night, I pulled out a cigarette and lit it. I immediately saw my grandmother's face in my mind and wondered if my grandchildren would have to talk about how they never got to meet me and only know me based on what my children (their parents) had told them. It broke my heart. I threw the cigarette out the window along with the whole pack I had in my purse.  I haven't touched a cigarette since. On March 25th it will have been two years since that happened.

**Edit: TL;DR: I never met my grandmother that died from smoking. I want to meet my grandkids, so I quit cold turkey.**""that pretty much was the same as I.  After seeing my daughter mimic me, I quit cold turkey. ""My neighbour did this at six with one of her mom's cigarettes. Mom was right there, didn't give a flying fuck. Daughter picked up up the habit before we got to high school. Thank's for being a good parent and quitting for your kid's sake.""It's a very mental addiction. You have to want to quit. If you think I really should quit smoking but you don't really want to you'll continue to smoke.   Once you have decided to quit and commit to it you will quit. Yes you will get cravings and have physical withdrawal, but you being committed to quitting will win. ""Grandfather used to smoke a pack a day ever since the 1940s.  In the 80s, he quit cold turkey when my mother said he could bever be around his grandkids if he smoked.""Had an uncle who smoked, but especially at night as he was watching TV. Problem is, he'd also doze off. One day he dozed off with a cigarette in his hand, it fell, and burned a hole in the carpet. Quit then and there. Rather give up the cigarettes than burn down his house."[deleted]"Wish my parents were as cool as you. They saw me do that at a young age and yelled at me. They saw my brother put a cigarette in his mouth when he was 2 and yelled at him, stupid shit. Still smoke to this day but whatever its their lungs.""I would cry T.T

Good for you to quit! ""My father died of lung cancer. But the first time I saw him in hospital and his deteriorating state gave me a real shock. I quit overnight, it wasn't even hard. ""My mom smoked for 35 years, until she got breast cancer and the doctors said she had to quit or the medication wouldn't work.""I like that you still waited until the next day. Better finish that pack, don't want to waste money.""My wife just had her sonogram about a month ago. It hadn't sunk in that I am going to be a dad until I saw those images. When we got out of the clinic, I handed her my cigarettes and lighter and said, ""ok, I give up."" Fourteen years smoking, countless times that my family tried to get me to quit, and what worked was some pictures of a little girl who's not even born yet. ""Exactly the same here. Being an older 1st time dad I realized I want to be around when she graduates high school... College..... Kids...maybe grandkids? Took me about 6 tries over the years, but that was the clincher.""My dad stopped smoking the day he knew my mom was pregnant with me. I love that story, makes me feel so loved and proud of my daddy <3"my new girlfriend started smoking after hanging with me for a few months. That was my motivation to stop. "Ok, so now I'm 26. I quit at the beginning of 2009. So it's been 5 years. Last couple of years, I've smoked a few cigars, no cigs. How did I quit?

I got to the point I fucking hated smoking. And instead of quitting, I kept smoking, hating every cigarette. It was terrible. I hated it so much. I continued this for about a month. Oh, also, I only rolled my own cigarettes, never smoked ""good"" cigarettes from a pack. Hand rolling is fucking disgusting, you look like a homeless guy doing it, you smell really bad, they're not as satisfying as cigarettes from a pack, you smell even worse because of how you hold it. This made me hate smoking even more.

When I finally quit, I felt so energized and happy. I felt like I got to quit, like it was a privilege. That weekend, I was holding cigarettes for my friends when they went in the house, shit like that, never taking a puff, everyone was amazed because I smoked SO much.

Hope this helps.

more details:

Made an account just for this.

Started smoking when I was 16. By 18 I was smoking about half a pack a day. By 19 about a pack a day.

Sometimes I'd wake up and it felt like I was trapped in a nightmare I couldn't get out of. Smelled like shit, not attractive, more money than I should be spending, hate cigarette companies, no buzz except when first wake up and/ or drunk.

Would impulsively try quitting. By impulsively, I mean would decide ""This friday, I'm going to quit."" Or I'd destroy all my cigarettes at the end of the night and flush them down the toilet.

This was a shitty cycle. Your mind plays tricks on you big time. I'd think ""Hmmm... live for the moment. What's the point of life if you don't enjoy it? You love smoking. Think about all those really good times you've had smoking."" Then I'd smoke again and be super fucking miserable, which saps the will to quit, on and on.

To those dicks that are like ""what, I thought you were quitting?"" when someone fails to quit. Go fuck yourself. You pick up smoking and quit, then we'll talk. Anyone that's actually quit never do that shit. I understand it's hard watching a loved one kill themselves, and it's hard to know what to do, but just don't do that if possible please.
""As the only non smoker- my daughter's father and my mom and brother smoke, when my daughter picked up a pen and said ""look this is my cigarette"" i went on a tirade. I found it so sad. I told her it was so bad, and that they were making bad decisions and that I never wanted to see her do that again. I hope she learned. "When my son was born I swore them off too.  I didn't want to give up any of my time with him to such a fixable habit.  My parents also smoked and I  reminded myself about how embarrassing it was to go to school smelling like cigarettes every day."I snorted Coca Cola from a straw when I was about 4 to show her I could do it too.  Short story: not the same as meth and my mom didn't stop.

Coca Cola: not even once."My wife was pregnant; promised that this would never happen. I don't break promises."When my 3 year old said the word 'cigarettes,' I switched to the vaporizer the next day.  In a few months I was using non-nicotine juice, then a few months later I was vape free.  I grew up around smokers.  Literally ever adult in my life as a child outside of school, besides my grandma, smoked.  Its basically the same for him on my side of the family and his father.  I was able to give it up while pregnant, when I found out even being around cigarettes would make me puke.  I didn't even think much about starting up again, but when my kid said that it hit me like a ton of bricks.  The best part is after vaping so long the smell bugs me.  Its the first time in my life outside of when I was pregnant that I even noticed the smell cigarettes have, because I'd been around it all my life.  I don't want that for my son.""Even after that you still had to wait until the next day to quit.  Nicotine, man.""I love how  you ""quit cold turkey the next day"" and not the same day. ""Exactly this. There is no ""trick"" to it, you just have to genuinely and completely WANT to stop. And it's tough, it's many small victories. My first was to resist every time I was in a store to buying a pack at the counter....they're RIGHT THERE. Just kept telling myself ""Nope. There's a reason you want to quit, remember that."""I quit the day I found out I was pregnant. That was 3 years ago. Nothing like being responsible for the health and life of another being to make you put things into perspective."That's almost exactly how it went for my dad. When my sister was born, he just quit cold turkey. No gum, no patches, not gradually, no nothing. He just didn't smoke anymore from one day to the next. ""My Dad quit when he was holding my brother as a baby, and accidentally burnt him.""I had to Google what cold turkey meant (I'm Dutch). I quit smoking weed cold turkey, but I still smoke cigarettes. I will quit someday whenever I really feel like quitting, but for the moment I don't WANT to yet. ""My wife getting pregnant.

I really just needed to truly WANT to quit.  If you go into quitting while expecting to put up a fight... you'll win the fight.""Pretty much this, wanting to quit is the main thing. I've tried various things gum, e-cgis and the rest but the moment for me was it was either smoking or moving forward with my girlfriend. Its been a month or so now and yes I've slipped but I am determined and I am getting the mental cravings less every day. ""Step 1: Get a girlfriend.

Step 2: Marry said girlfriend.

Step 3: Knock 'er up!

Step 4: Can finally quit smoking.

just kidding, but good for you!"It's like that for a lot of things. Especially fitness. You've got to want it."Yep, I think sometimes having another life to live for increases the value of your own. "[deleted]"Exactly the same.  My wife quit as soon as she found out she was pregnant, and as soon as her super-prego-senses developed I was on a clock to quitting...  

Being told daily, ""You stink.  Go in the other room,"" is a great motivator.  I knew I would need the extra lung capacity to chase after little ones, anyway.  :)""For me it was also having a daughter. When she was with me, of course I wouldn't smoke. When I knew she'd be with me, I wouldn't smoke that day so I wouldn't smell like it. 

The hardest part was giving up smoking while I was driving. It was a habit I enjoyed most. But if I knew my daughter would be with me, i wouldn't smoke in my car two days before. Overtime, she was with me more and more, I smoked less and less until one day I noticed I wasn't doing it at all any more.


I should add that I also wanted to quit. It made me self conscious at work. During meetings, during conversations with co-workers. Smelling like cigarette smoke sucks.""I wish my husband did. Daughter is 2 mo old. I make a point every time he comes inside to he better wash his hands AND change his shirt. Sounds like being a bitch, but a newborn does not need to smell that!""Right on, brother. The first time my wife got pregnant we hesitated. We only slowed down the smoking. Then we lost the baby. Let me tell you that shit hurt. We cried for quite some time.

The second time we got pregnant we walked outside and had our last cigarette. Now we have a perfect little one year old girl. I don't know if it was the smoking or nature taking it's course. One thing I can say is, fuck I'm happy right now.""Same thing that did it for my dad. He smoked right up until around the time that my mom got pregnant with me, and then she told him that there was no way in hell he was going to smoke with me around, so he stopped. "Do you live in Dallas by any chance?"Thats how my dad did it, it was in his head that life is about to get to a point where hes gonna let go of some habits. He cared , so he stopped instantly.  Never did smoke a thing,  except meat, for the past 26 years. Now hes 47, has a damm admirable charisma,  being hes a CDL driver (Class A & B , but mostly B vehicles) .""My wife getting pregnant did it for me too.  She was a smoker too, so I stopped to make it easier for her to stop.  It was the hardest but probably the best thing I've ever done.  
Also, I didn't want my kids to be raised in a house of smokers like I was.""This is how I quit! Wife told me she was pregnant, So much was going through my mind that I figured, if my life is going to change, I might as well quit this shit and turn myself into someone my child can be proud of.""ok, excellent, this is key, I have my notes out

*get girl pregnant - you will stop smoking cigarettes*""yeah , let me tell this to my friend so he will quite smoking. "I haven't smoked a cigarette in over a year. I was a pack a day smoker for around 15 years. I quit cold turkey using the book Alan Carr's easyway to stop smoking. Someone posted it to reddit late one night and I decided fuck it it can't hurt to read it. You are told to smoke at different points throughout the book and then have one last cigarette after you finish the whole book.  Well that last cigarette happened to coincide with the last in my pack and the next morning I just wasn't motivated to buy another pack and I haven't since.[deleted]I used the same book as did my wife and three friends. Worked immediately and have never looked back. "Eight years ago, that was my story as well.""My fiancee quit using this book after several years of failed attempts to quit. He only needed to read half the book before he stopped smoking, but finished it anyway. He is now one of the most obnoxious former smokers anyone could meet, and proud of it.""Carr's book worked instantly for me too - 15yrs of heavy smoking.  Gave it to five or six of my friends.  They all quit, too.""Pretty much exactly the same thing happened to me, about 2 years ago. I got it on amazon because I thought, why not? Previously I had quit for about a week cold turkey, but after a stressful night at work I picked it up again.

The big difference I can see is that many people that quit using other methods are still sneaking cigarettes at times, especially when drinking. I remain repulsed by the very thought of smoking, and will (hopefully) remain so.""Same for me, except I had around 6 smokes left in my pack when I finished the book. Breaking them up and pouring water over them was an amazingly freeing experience."Anybody have the link for it? Id love to read it myself. Can confirm."Of all my friends that have quit smoking, the ones that used the book smoke the fewest cigarettes. (as in none, versus everyone else still bumming/sneaking smokes)

There's something to be said for being satisfied and confident in your decision, I wouldn't want to not smoke if I felt like I was missing out.  Poor bastards.""Alan Carr
^Everyone should at least give his book a try.""I read the Alan Carr Easyway book.  It worked for a couple of months and then I was back on the fags.  

I went to one of the Alan Carr Easyway days.  Similar technique to the book but in a room full of people, lead by an ex smoker.  It really helped me to stop.  I have the occasional smoke, generally when I am too drunk to see straight, but I am confident I will never be a smoker again.  It was pretty expensive but not compared to maintaining the habit.  

""145 days ago I finished this book. I have saved a 700 dollars, and ran around with my 7 year old playing basketball just now. I was able to get my wife pregnant 2 months after I quit AFTER TRYING FOR 5 YEARS! Read the book, watch Allen Carr on Youtube. Shit Works...""Similarly I had quit watching a video one night that pretty much explained the nicotine triggers. I quit for 4-5 months after that but stressful job and traveling got me smoking again.
Now I'm free though. Through sheer will :)""I used the book to help change my mindset, and haven't smoked in almost a year. I don't miss it at all. I can't help but notice everyone here talking about vaping, but I'm grateful that I didn't trade one method intoducing nicotine into my body for another.  
I always feared that I would crave cigarettes for years to come...this is absolutely not the case.  
I did, however,  hit a good vaper one time, and had cravings for 3 days."Just ordered this book after reading these comments. Wish me luck! "Same here.  Piece of cake with this book.  I went away for the weekend with some friends, and took the book with me, thinking it was a good time to try because I would be distracted and out of my normal routine.  3 days later, I drove back home 4 hours with a smoker in the back seat and had absolutely no desire."You were a smoker a year ago and you had the username TheDoctorsCompanion. Your account is 1019 days old also :D"I read this post earlier today, I started the book straight away. I just got to the end of Ch 8 where you are told to have a smoke and think of the taste, texture and what it feels like. Most disgusting smoke I have had since my first.

I am reading this book till the end. Thank you in advance. ""So I got this book upon a recommendation from a friend. And started reading it, and it was great. I liked it right off the bat because the guy didn't talk about the fact smoking was bad etc, but instead concentrated on the experiences that make up smoking. 

Thing is I got through like 3/4 of the book really quick, and it started scaring me that it was so thin. I mean I felt good about everything I was reading, but this irrational fear that there's no way this is enough to get me to quit gripped. And there's the talk about the ritual at the end. The logic here is silly, I can recognize that, but at the same time I get this fear that this thing isn't _substantial_ enough to do what it advertises.

I've been meaning to get back to it, and do it right.

Just out of curiosity, did you finish this book in one go or break it up as you went through? What would you recommend having gone through it.""Vaping. I haven't smoked since August and I don't miss it.

AND this is after a 30 year habit!""Same here. Pack a day down to nothing. Gave up vaping when I weened myself down to zero nicotine juice, and donated my gear to a friend. No smoking or vaping since October! No more coughing shit up! ""Seconded. I tried so many different things to quit, but vaping was the only thing that worked. Almost 2 years and no cigs.""Me and my SO both had been struggling to quit for a few years, then we tried a vapour e cig and we stopped almost instantly. Haven't wanted one for months now!""Yay :) I'm a newbie (one month on Saturday!) and loving it. Apart from a couple of twinges I haven't struggled at all, which considering my cold turkey attempts is bloody magical. ""20 years smoking maybe 2 packs a day. 2 weeks 100% smoke free tomorrow. I had tried electronics several times over the years. You basically need to find a good mod and a juice you really like. The Blu shit you see in the gas stations wont do it. The actual quit process took me about a month, but I'm finally totally off tabacco.People need to do themselves a favor and spend $30 on a Kanger Evod kit and get a couple different juices. Keep getting different juice until you find one you love. And every time you want to smoke, go outside and puff on that. Eventually you'll want to puff on the ecig, not a real cigarette. Then start puffing it inside. Once you actually enjoy it, you may want to upgrade to a better mod/kit, which I have done. I still haven't spent a ton of money, but I know its less than I would have spent on cigarettes. Now I can just get juice every couple weeks for a huge different in money. I absolutely love a couple juices and I crave those now. I'm planning on tapering the nicotine down and eventually quitting juice altogether. But right now I couldn't be happier. I don't wheeze anymore and I don't feel like I'm on the brink of death after a run. And I feel fucking fantastic in general. And I'm proud of myself. :-)"Can you recommend a decent vape for the average (hopefully soon to be ex-) cigarette smoker?"Yes, same here! Although not a 30 year habit, ""just"" 18 years.
After i found my preferred flavours and nicotine strenghts it was easy :-)"Vaping did the trick for me and my wife. I was smoking almost 2 packs a day and stepped down my nicotine with the ecig. I don't use the ecig anymore BTW.[deleted]"Same here. Smoked for almost 30 years. Had switched to cigarellos two years before quitting. I bought a Blu e-cig and it was awful. Didn't work at all. Bought a proper vape setup with the help of /r/electronic_cigarette and when I finished my last pack of cigarellos I started vaping. That was several months ago and I'm down to 6mg and my next bottle will be 0mg. 

It was the easiest bad habit I have ever dropped. There were a day or two a week into quitting that were a little jittery but after that passed, I haven't wanted or needed one since. Changed my life.""Same, 20 year habit, most recently 40 cigs a day. Been vaping for about 6 months now.""Especially with a good quality mod, good tank and good juice. "Hands down to vaping. I'm only on my first week now of quitting the cigs but its been very successful so far. Its a good transition for quitting. I highly recommend it. "Been vaping since January 21st last year. No plan to ween myself off yet, since i bulk ordered the stock, but im spending nothing now and i don't see myself being willing to spring for more now im out of the habit of paying for it.""My wife and I quit in September after ~20 years in. Ecigs FTW!

It's expensive up front, and that hurt. But we figured out that with our starter kits we just paid what we would have spent on cigarettes for the month. Of course subsequent months are much, much cheaper. I use a little over 10ml of 18mg juice a week. That feels pricey at $9 a bottle, but since that's replacing $45-50 a carton for the same length of time it's a big win.

Advice for those wanting to try it, start with the higher nicotine juices. We started at 24mg. I'm at 18mg now and looking to lower again soon. We tried once before this with weak gear and weaker juice (12mg) and it just didn't work. Suck it up and drop the money on a big cigar sized ecig. I know it seems like the little ones would be more familiar but trust me, they just aren't up to the task. You also end up spending more on refills.

After a few weeks you will notice your habits shifting. Since you can smoke in places you couldn't before you will find different triggers, but you will lose some old ones.

You will need to find a flavor you can live with. Personally I loathe the flavor of ALL the tobacco flavored ones. They all just taste nasty. I went menthol. I never smoked menthols, but the menthol flavors gave me a sense that I was doing something, but didn't taste bad (""Smoothathol"" is my favorite). Find a ecig store and try as many as you need to to find the one that works for you. It may be very different from your cigarette brand. It's simply a different experience than smoking.

Honestly even if you never stop vaping this is better for you that smoking, and OMG so much better to live with. No standing in the cold/heat smoking, no rain in through the window in the car, you can smell things, the list goes on.

**TL;DR: Vaping is great. Suck it up and buy the big kit. Use strong juice at first. Find a flavor you like.**""Yep. Started a few weeks back with an eGo-c 650mAh. Graduated almost immediately to two eGo Twist 1100mAh and PT2 mini. Now, three weeks later, I'm sitting at my desk with a iTaste 134, two PT2s and about 50 bottles of juice. 

Haven't had a cigarette since and yesterday I was able to make it through my 25 minute cardio workout without stopping to catch my breath for the first time. Pretty excited.

The Android ""Vape"" app tells me I'll break even in March. Unless I buy that Vamo I've had my eye on. And more Unicorn Poop. And Snake Oil. ""I started vaping in August as well, smoke free ever since, good job!""> I have the electronic cigarette, but I end up smoking real ones anyway.

All electronic cigarettes are not created equal, and a good quality unit made it easy for me to quit cigs after 8 years smoking after several failed attempts with cold turkey and mints.  The two things you have to get over are that it won't look like a cigarette, and it won't taste like a cigarette.

Something like this with a handful of different flavors to try would be a great place to start: http://www.myvaporstore.com/Vision_Spinner_Joye_Ego_C_Twist_Combo_p/vvs-c.htm"This is way too far down the thread. If vaping doesn't get outlawed entirely I could see it replacing cigarettes completely."2 pack-a-day smoker for 20 years, started vaping 3 months ago, haven't had a cigarette since. Started at 18 mg nicotine, now vaping 6 mg with no cravings.

I believe there are studies that show that cigarettes have MAO inhibitors that end up making the nicotine in cigarettes MUCH more addictive. Once you get those out of your system, it's very easy to lower your nicotine levels until you get to 0 mg."I vape too. I think we're friends now."I smoked cloves for 30 years and switched to an e-cig two years ago. Highly recommended for those who dont really *want* to quit but know they need to. Just don't even bother with those little ones that look like cigarettes, they are rarely satisfying.""Same, quit August 23. Been vaping since.""Been vaping for the past 3 weeks, had a few cigarettes but none in almost a week. I keep going back to a week, but the vaping is helping immensely!!!""Me too. 25 years of smoking, and countless attempts at quitting. I tried a cig-a-like and it didn't work at all. I finally bought an EVOD and I haven't looked back since. Vaping was what finally got me away from cigarettes.

""Hit my 3 year anniversary in December (smoked for 13 years). Have actually stepped down my nicotine by half now, not because I was trying, but because I found I couldn't handle higher concentrations after awhile. ""Came here to say Vaping ... 6 months analog free now.  And even Vaping is also limited. Doing 6 mg nicotine now, feel i am ready for 0 nic.""What's either really nice or a real bummer for some people depending on the person, is it's more than likely you will vape less and less as time goes on to the point where you won't want to vape at all anymore. "THIS!  37 and been a struggling on/of smoker since 18.  Started vaping and have been fine without real smoke."I used to chew and smoke. I went out and made a $30 investment into a shit igo-T and a clearomizer. (for those who don't know they're like just above a Blu as far as quality-- pretty much garbage)

I haven't smoked or chewed in almost a year. Vaping on my Igo-L+Magneto with some home made juice as I type this. :)

My suggestion is to do just that. Go to a local tobacco shop, buy a crappy $25 vape see how you like it. Then upgrade... it makes a huge difference as far as flavor and heat goes. You'll never look back"Smoked 2packs a day from 15-25. Picked up a e-cig and was at the highest mg for 3 weeks and one day i was sitting on the couch and just said fuck it! Now my mom who has smoked for 30+ years is using my old one and I have been off it for 14 months.Same here~! Vaping continues to keep me off of the cancer sticks. I smoked for over 15 years and was at more than a pack a day before I first tried quitting. No I'm strictly vaping!"Tomorrow is three weeks for me. My homeless person cough? Gone. Stinky clothes? No more. I made out with this dude the other day and mid smooch he pulled back and said ""you taste so much better without that smoky taste."" Sold. Fucking sold. I'm now a lady. 

Saturday I'm hoping to get more juice, going to start decreasing the nicotine. I've already saved so much money, I feel so much better, I have no clue why I was so stubborn about waiting to do this. ""Another ""same here,"" here. Was a pack a day smoker; I took up vaping with the intention of slowly phasing out my smoking habit. The first day, I only smoked half a pack. The next few days, I only smoked one or two. Within a week, I was done, completely. I just didn't want to smoke anymore, y'know?""Saved me for sure. 2 of my brothers, my oldest sister, and my dad, and two of my friends have also dropped cigarettes in exchange for vaping.

I've never seen anything come close to the success rate of vaporizers."I did the same thing. Vaping saved me "I'll throw my story on this one too.  Smoked for 24 years, up to 2 packs a day by the end.  I had tried the gum, the lozenge, the patch, the inhaler, the wellbutrin, the chantix, and the cold turkey...  Everything but the hypnosis.

Hell, I had even tried vaping twice before, but the gear I had just didn't cut it.

November of last year one of the guys at work showed me a rig that hadn't even been thought of the last time I tried e-cigs.  I found a setup online for ~30 bucks and it showed up to my house on a Friday.  I went from 35 cigs to 3 overnight.  By Monday I had smoked my last one and was now a non-smoker.  That was 11/11/13, and I haven't had one since.

I started at a relatively high nicotine, and in the last 2.5 months I have weaned myself from 18mg/ml down to 6mg/ml, and I haven't had a craving that I couldn't vape through.

There are no silver bullets here.  The reason that cold-turkey has been proven to be the most effective cessation method is that you have to **want** to quit before you **can** quit.  Very few people pick up the first e-cig they find and magically lose all desire to smoke.  But if you want to quit, vaping is the easiest way to make cold turkey tolerable.

Started weaning myself off cigarettes but had a hard time quitting completely until I came down with a mean cold last May, decided to strictly vape since cigarettes would irritate the crap out of my lungs and I was truly ready to give up the habit - the cons outweighed the pros by a huge margin as a new father.

Don't ya just love these things?""Same story for me.  I bought a nice kit, then found the right juice for me, and accidentally quit smoking regular cigarettes.  I enjoyed the new juice so much that I realized it had been three days since I'd had a real cigarette.  I lit one up, took two drags off it, and realized that it tasted horrible now!  I haven't even thought about picking one up since that day.  That was a few weeks before Christmas.  I was a pack and a half a day smoker for about 18 years, tried quitting multiple different ways, and it was this e-cig that totally took my mind off of cigarettes.

I have smoked less than a pack of smokes since starting (most of those within the first 3 days of buying my setup) and have only slipped a few times. I'm not especially hard on myself when I slip. If I smoke 1 cig a week, it's still at least 140 times better than what I was doing. Oh, and I live with a smoker who refuses to quit, and I still don't bum off him. Or smoke his leftovers. Having tried to go cold turkey and with nicotine aids at least 10 times in my 12 years of smoking and always giving up less than a week in, vaping is a goddamn miracle. ""I never thought about quitting cigarettes, but I hated the smell and taste. So I tried fruity flavours in e-cigs and I didn't touch a normal cigarette from the first day.

Only problem is, it has become a hobby rather than a habbit now, and it's costing me almost as much as smoking is :P""Vaping since Jan 2013 here!

It's cheaper, you don't smell like shit, you can actually breathe and taste food, you have tons of flavors to play with, and best of all, you can virtually vape anywhere without bothering anybody! I found out vaping is worth it and actually works during a night of binge drinking.

My long term goal is to gradually lower the nicotine strength and quit altogether. If not, I'll just continue vaping. I have a bad habit of wanting to smoke something when I'm stressed or bored, which happens fairly often."this"I just bought my first mod after using an eGo for awhile, what a difference! One year smoke free Nov. 5th after nearly 10 years of smoking.""Vaping did it for me too. After just two weeks of it, if I tried smoking again I would notice the horrible taste of glue and ash to be able to enjoy it anymore.

But I was never really a heavy smoker, so I can't say it would be the same for everyone.""Also can confirm. I've been smoking for 7 years then was forced into vaping.

Maybe I was doing it wrong after reading everyone else in this thread saying it worked.  When I vaped, my throat absolutely killed me for a while afterward, really dry and scratchy.""a ton of my friends quit this way.  reducing Nicotine down to zero.

Any focus I can get helps.  

I quit smoking for a year about 15 years back.   I wanted a cigarette every day.   I struggled and stayed strong for a year.   On exactly the year anniversary, I broke down and started the whole habit back up.   Since I started vaping I have not really wanted a cigarette at all.  I tried four of them during the last year.  None of them got finished and every one of them reminded me of how nasty they are.  Without vaping, I guarantee I would still be smoking, and stinking, and coughing, and wheezing.   ""This, Quit 242 days ago. Cravings for a real cigarette were very minimal. This was after 25 years of smoking a pack a day of Marlboro Reds.""Same here! I used to smoke and dip a lot and switched to ecigs. I can breathe so much better, working out more and the flavored taste pretty dank.""I quit cold turkey and went for a year, but that didn't protect me from everyone else's smoking. As soon as someone lit one up, all I wanted to do was start up again. This is why I started vaping (using an electronic cigarette). It's been one year vaping (two without cigarettes) for me and I haven't ever looked back. The vaping equipment is crucial and the juice you use is crucial. The difference between crap equipment and uninspiring juice is so incredible; not to mention that people's tastes in the vape world are extremely varied, so you have to find something personally satisfying for you. Don't give up. Trying lots of different types of each (juice and equipment) is key. I know it can be hard when you want to save money, but put all your would be ""cigarette money"" towards vaping and worry about saving after you found something great. Put your guilt aside while vaping and get addicted to it, it's much easier to cut down on vaping than smoking cigarettes in my honest opinion. ""Vaping since Feb 2012. Almost two years since I quit a 19 year habit.  Cut back on vaping as well. 

Hoping I can be  free of it all before end of the year.

Vaping is the way to go for sure"This needs to be the top comment. 15 years of cigarettes to vaping in one day."I like vaping because it is better than smoking by a lot. However, i find that the percentage of people who actually quit nicotine this way is very very low. I think the best way to quit with vaping it is to use an e-cig with NO nicotine. Otherwise you are doing the exact same habits with the exact same drug with a different tool.. except now you can ALSO smoke inside so you learn new habits and smoke more often. Most people who attempt to step down on nicotine levels never do and actually everyone I've seen who started vaping now smokes more cigarettes than they did before as they got used to higher levels of nicotine. ""But are you still vaping? If so, you still have a nicotine addiction which you've not addressed.""serious question: How is this different from saying ""I used to drink beer all the time, but now I just have a small amount of whiskey. Finally sober after 30 years!""

Another serious question: Is vaping actually ""drug""-related? I mean, I have seen a few local shops selling electronic cigarettes, and the green signs with the rasta flags and pot leaves all over the windows, make me assume that there's more to this than a simple cigarette alternative. Not to mention, the people who like electronic cigarettes seem a little *too* enthusiastic about them."My mom won't use electronics because she read somewhere they put poison in it. That's also bad for your health thoughBut you're still ingesting nicotine.You're still addicted to nicotine."Quit nicotine completely, you will feel better knowing you're not addicted to anything."You're still saturating your lungs in nicotine which is not good for you."Is that really quitting smoking though? I mean, it's like asking someone how they quit drinking soft drinks, and having them answer that they've switched to sweet tea or other sugary non-carbonated beverages instead.

Vaping is clearly the better alternative, but it's just a replacement."Someone should report this comment to the FDA for advertising this product for smoking cessation"I don't think this really counts as quitting smoking. Don't get me wrong, it's way less harmful to vape, but you're still addicted to nicotine. It is a clearer delivery method of the drug that is addictive (a harmful drug at that). A lot of vape liquids also contain trace amounts of toxins still. I congratulate anyone who moves from cigarettes to e-cigs, but one who uses them is still, in a sense, and addict. "Straight up force of will. I smoked since I was a fetus pretty much.  I looked at my little daughter I decided I'd much rather be there to see her grow up. You have to want it. [deleted]Which blue card did you exile from your hand to pay for FoW?">I smoked since I was a fetus pretty much.

This must be you then:

Here it is [NSFW?]:

http://youtu.be/iUolSGfXbN0"I wonder how quickly you could save up for a Force of Will by quitting. My uncle did the same thing. His youngest daughter asked him if he would still be alive to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. Those words convinced him to replace smoking with eating fruit. Now he's addicted to apples. :)Fear of death will do it. "I applaud you, my friend. I just wanted to say that.""Two things, an e-cigarette and actually wanting to quit. I couldn't have done it cold turkey (I'd tried a couple of times) but using the e-cig for a few months worked very well. I ended up using it less and less as time went on, and finally stopped altogether.""I think I'm like 7 times more addicted to nicotine now that I vape. I went down to 12mg, then 6mg...then back to 12mg. I hit this damn thing constantly."Can you recommend an e-cig? Or basically any e-cig brand out there work most of the time?[deleted][deleted]"Can confirm, respiratory therapist here. The way I explain it to my patients is: imagine the nicotine receptors in your brain are little kids and cigarettes are chocolate. If you've been feeding these kids chocolate and one day say ""Hey guys, some of you can have chocolate... But most of you can't"" the kids are gonna be pissed. This is like cutting down on smoking, the receptors in your brain want the nicotine even more because there is a reminder of what they're missing. But if one day you tell the kids NOBODY GETS CHOCOLATE ANYMORE they'll cry for a bit and then get over it.

Edit; Original commenter was stating that quitting cold turkey is the best and really only way to quit smoking, as that's what finally worked for him/her. Obviously different methods work best for different people so don't y'all ""cutting back gradually"" success stories jump on my back about it. I don't care if you did it cold turkey or not: props for doing it!""That is the same way I quit too.

Tried a bunch of stuff over the years.  At one point I tried to wean myself off cigarettes....I think I was down to smoking one cigarette per day for two months.   None of it works.

At Sep. 4, 2004 at 10:45am I said ""enough"" and never picked up another one.  Everyone I know who successfully quit has a similar story.  You just have to get so disgusted with yourself that you can't bear the thought of being a slave to it any longer.""> cold turkey

As someone whose English isn't my main language, this got me thinking why cold turkey (the food) would be that good.""It worked for me. Started around 17. After about 6 years I decided I would quit and I just fucking did it. The first week was the worst but it got better after that. Its been, what 10 years? 

Will power is an amazing thing. ""I had tried quitting 7 times when I finally did it. It was July 4th weekend 2011. I had spent the entire fours days with my boyfriend who did not like smoking (and pretty much told me we'd be done if I continued). I didn't smoke for those four days and decided to go for it. Now I'm married and have a baby with the guy. I'm so glad I quit for him; his reasons were solid, and I had wanted to but never had a real reason to do it. ""I got sick with strep throat and didn't smoke for three days from it. Decided if I was gonna quit, now was a swell time to try. Tuesday was one year for me so here's hoping I don't fall back in it!"Cold turkey worked for all 8 times I quit.  "Question for you as a successful quitter: How do I get myself to *want* to quit? I just don't have the desire to quit, I like it. It calms me down, I don't have any of the side effects of smoking (bad health, lower stamina, etc.) I work out regularly, I can run mile after mile without dying.

I know it's bad for me but somehow I just don't care (I'm addicted). I'll quit for a week or so here and there but I always go back, I tell myself that I *want* to smoke and that I can always quit later.

It's like an abusive boyfriend that I just can't say ""No."" to.

My wife just became pregnant for the first time. I know I need to quit for my child's sake, but I guess I just don't have the mental fortitude. I don't like admitting weakness, I guess that's why I can only do it to an internet stranger.

Anyways, thanks for listening and let me know if you have any advice.

EDIT: typo. Also, thanks for all the good advice. I appreciate it.

EDIT: A lot of the same questions that I can answer here:

- I am 30
- I don't smoke in my house or in my car

Also, I appreciate everybody being so polite about calling me an idiot, retard, etc.! It's funny. People are like, ""You suck so bad and you're an asshole. Not to be a dick though."" Reminds me of a Dumb and Dumber quote: ""You are one pathetic loser! No offense.""

I REALLY appreciate the support from all of you, and I think I'm going to get that book everyone keeps mentioning by Alan Carr.




EDIT: Well. Today's the day. Today is DAY ONE. Wish me luck.""I once had an intelligent man ask me if I enjoyed smoking, I replied Yes.

He then proceeded to ask me if I wanted to smoke forever, I replied No.

After, He asked, ""Titus, are you a smoker?""

Naturally I replied, Yes I am.

He told me that the day I label myself as not a smoker or tell myself, No I don't smoke, if someone were to ask me. Then that is the day that I can quit, but until that day I will always be a smoker, not I'm trying to quit, not I only smoke when I'm drunk, not I only smoke socially, just a smoker.

tl;dr You have to believe you aren't a smoker to quit smoking, and then don't smoke.

Edit: Gramz"I quit smoking just over 11 years ago. Cold turkey as well. Was sitting in my backyard smoking and looked at the damn thing and put it out. Walked to the trashcan and threw away the pack and the lighter. I still get cravings to this day. It's a decision you have to make. I'm a strong believer of willpower. The mind can overcome anything."When I first quit, after a few weeks, my sense of smell started returning. I was overwhelmed by just how *bad* so many things smelled. Everywhere, just awful smells. I think I must have re-learned how to filter out bad smells again now, it was just an unexpected negative side affect to quitting at the time."I recently quit cold turkey. I have gone 4 months without a cig. The first week or two suck but it gets so much easier after that."As a non native English speaker, I genuinely thought you were about to say something about eating cold turkey and how it would help. ""My wife quit cold turkey.  She slipped up and had a couple of cigs after that, but never bought another pack.  We were dating at the time and she knew that I would prefer if she didn't smoke (I don't), so she quit.  We had been friends a long time and I never pressured her about it; she just knew that's what I would prefer so she did it for me.

At the same time we have friends that have tried to quit multiple times.  It just seems like the don't really want to quit when they try.  It's more like, ""Yeah, I should quit, so I'll try, but I still really enjoy smoking.""  I think having a good reason to quit that really matters to you helps."Exactly. Cold turkey was the best method. Also stay away from bars for the first week. Also had a calendar with the amount of money i was saving. It helped reinforce going cold turkey. "My gram smoked for 50 years. Yes you heard it, half a century. She had a heart attack recently and quit smoking cold turkey. She was pretty angry for the first 3 weeks but it went away... somewhat...""I know this was how a friend did it for himself, just cold turkey and he's been off for 7 years (his third attempt got it right).

He did say that, for him, it was a huge help that his gf also quit at the same time.  So they kind of pushed one another.  It might be beneficial to find another person and make a pact together to quit ""I'll chime in on this one as this was my experience as well. I started smoking when I was 16. I tried to quit numerous times - pills (chantix, zyban), e-cigs, patches for a long week, ""the book,"" - none of it worked, or at least stuck. One day, last fall about 110 days ago, I went to buy a pack of cigarettes and get a cup of coffee.

And I just decided not to. So I didn't. And I quit.

There was a lot going on in my life - a positive relationship with a woman who doesn't smoke (but didn't give me grief about it), job was going well, finally had a few bucks in my pocket so I was less stressed - lots of things that probably put me in a more quit-centric mindset. 

But I've gotten stressed since. And had no money. And tough days at work. And great triggers (a perfect cup of coffee on a crisp fall morning, a fabulous meal, a beer in a sunset, champagne on a roof - all wonderful, amazing things that always had a cigarette attached to them). And I've gotten through every single one of them by simply not_smoking. I didn't use gum, or a patch, or an e-cig or a line from a book. I simply didn't smoke. 

And when you're mind is ready and you're keen to retrain yourself to disassociate those amazing things with cigarettes, you will. 

Good luck and keep in the back of your mind, if nothing else, that one day you'll be ready too. "[deleted]"You have the best kind of ""I quit"" story.

""I was just sanding there and i had had enough. *So I just stopped*""""Tbh, it really doesn't make any sense to me how the slower method of using patches or gum will help anyone quit. You're still ingesting big amounts of nicotine daily. 

Edit: i know nicotine is not really as harmful as all the other carcinogens in tobacco cigarretes, my point is that if you ingest nicotine products you may still deeply crave for cigarettes even if you consume less of them. ""This truely is the only way to quit. You have to really want to quit, and you can't give yourself any opportunity to slip. (nursing the addiction)""Me too - cold turkey, with a wife at home holding me accountable.  There's no way, really, to sneak a cig and not smell like it when you get home.""There is still some stuff you can do which helps you in the process.

Prime example would be to wait until you catch a serious cold, you will sleep most of the time and wont really like smoking for the duration. If youre lucky the cold lasts a few days and youve already overcome the worst.""Cold turkey is the only way. I just honestly *wanted* to quit. I couldn't breathe. It got to a point where I was having a cigarette and then using my inhaler afterwards. I was like why the fuck am I even doing this to myself, so I quit cold turkey and it's the best decision I've ever made. After a week or so it got much easier. I miss cigs occasionally, when I drink mainly, so I don't do that much anymore either. A friend of mine says she wants to quit but when she tries she just goes right back to it. She says she's just not ready. But if you truly *want* to quit, you will. ""This. I have tried to quit with the patch, and the gum, and everything else that's out there. Last year I just decided I was done, I spent too much money on smoking, and it really does make everything smell awful. No your chewing gum, and twenty dollar bottle of Adidas for men cologne does NOT make you smell any better, despite what you may think. 

So I just quit. I told myself for the entire last pack this is it, after this I'm done. And then right before I smoked the last one, I put the cigarette, and lighter in the pack and threw it out the window while I was driving. Don't ask me why I did that, I have no idea. But I haven't touched one since then. It's was hell for about two weeks, but then it wasn't so bad. I hardly ever even think about smoking anymore, and it's unbelievable to me that I lived so long smelling like that, just yesterday someone walked past me smoking and it almost made me sick. ""Cold Turkey is by far the best. I found it to be most successful when I tried to imagine myself back in childhood, I didn't need a smoke when playing on the playground so why do I need one now? Change your mindset and you'll do great.""9 years straight, dropped it absolutely cold turkey and never looked back. You aren't quitting if you are weening. ""I tried weaning myself off cigs for a while but you are exactly right, especially your last sentence. It first takes a genuine desire to quit, an authentic feeling of ""I am done with this."" I finally had that moment myself when I was halfway through a cigarette once. I just thought ""This is making me feel like crap and I'm not happy doing it anymore,"" put out the cigarette, and gave away the rest of the pack to my friends. After that, quitting cold turkey was easy. Well, maybe not *easy*, but it became clear that it was the only way.""Agreed, i have only been able to quit with this method. Though I have found that quitting with someone you care to be accountable to helps tons with cravings.""cold turkey for me, with a caveat: i got sick.

i tried like hell to quit, threw away a bunch of full packs trying to cold-turkey it only to dig through the trash later.  believe me, it's very hard to quit cold turkey.

then i got sick.

i didn't even get very sick, just caught a cold or something and didn't want to go outside.  i felt miserable enough to not want to do anything for a couple of days, even smoke.  i guess the misery of sickness masked the misery of missing nicotine in my head, and when i got better i stayed off cigarettes as though i'd gotten better from that too.  it was still weird not going outside a lot, but i didn't feel bad about it since i was still on that ""i feel better"" high."Cold turkey worked for me. Everything else still keeps you addicted in some way. Been stopped for over a year and a half now with no want to go back.I'm three weeks into cold turkey and so far it's went well. I've had to avoid alcohol as I think that would be a big temptation to smoke again but so far so good. I was a bit tetchy at first and I found it difficult to break my old routines but I think it should be much easier now. I still fantasise about smoking though. "After 5 years and watching countless friends attempt to quit and relapse I did cold turkey. What helped the most was not drinking for about a month too, so I wouldn't get drunk and crave a cigarette""Yup. Smoked for thirty years. Quit cold turkey about 10 years ago. That worked.

It helps if instead of trying to make your virtuous nature (if any) try to suppress your vices, you just set your vices to fighting each other. I am lazy and a pussy about the cold. When I was banned from smoking indoors, I whined and bitched about having to go outside and leave off what I was doing, and *it's snowing*, ferchristsakes! 

I'm still lazy. I don't smoke. Lazy wins! Bring on the next vice.""I used a patch, but only for about a week.  I don't know if it helped or not.  I successfully quit though!""Although I never smoked, I did dip, and I would agree cold turkey is the best way to go.  While at my house I had a dip in and my buddy asked me how much I dipped and I told him ""a can a day."" He told me I should probably stop or at least cut back. That was the last dip I ever had.

I'd say the first 3-4 days are the most difficult. If you can make it that far you should be able to quit for good.""This, and know that it may take many tries before you finally quit.  The important thing is to KEEP TRYING and don't give up.  "[deleted]"I, too, say that cold turkey is the way to go. Doesn't mean I don't still think about it / maybe have the occasional one at a party but overall cold turkey is silly effective."This is the only way.I smoked for 7 years and quit cold turkey. worked well for me."That worked for me too. I tried the gums and patches but they don't take the craving for nicotine away. Cold turkey is the best option definitely. Its still sometimes hard to be without smoking and sometimes when Im drunk I smoke one or two but I get a huge mental hangover from it, sometimes bigger than from drinking alcohol. It makes me mad and angry."That's how I did it. Will power. Last smoke was 19 December 2010"That worked for me too. I tried the gums and patches but they don't take the craving for nicotine away. Cold turkey is the best option definitely. Its still sometimes hard to be without smoking and sometimes when Im drunk I smoke one or two but I get a huge mental hangover from it, sometimes bigger than from drinking alcohol. It makes me mad and angry.""Worked for me as well, but. . . 

You have to want to. You have to have your own reasons to. 

I smoked for 12 years. Got up to nearly 2 packs a day at points. 

What kicked me was that my wife hated it, and I love my wife. I know smoking is bad. That's a no brainer. But I liked it. But I like my wife a lot more. I also had a 1 year old son at the time. I couldn't imagine him smelling it on me. 

So bottom line for me was to realize my reasons, and just do it. I've been quit 5 1/2 years now. ""This is how my dad did it too! He quit like 7 years ago, just decided to stop suddenly one day.""It worked for me. It took a few tries over a few years, but I haven't had a cigarette since Jan. 1, 2009.""Definitely this way. It was weird for me I hit a cigarette and it tasted horrible, you know what I mean, I looked at it said to hell with it and threw it down. I never had a craving or anything. I rode around with a pack on my dash for about 6 weeks and then gave them away.""as a kid, i thought ""cold turkey"" was actually eating cold pieces of turkey instead of smoking""True this.  You have to want it, and want it bad.  Cigs are one of the most addictive things in the world, they will always find a way to bring you back for one more.  You have to really want to quit and just fucking do it.""No one ever wants to hear these answers, but it's really what works. What's even better is that once you do it you feel like you can do absolutely anything. Get in shape? Not as hard as quitting smoking. Go on a diet? Not as hard as quitting smoking? Move to Mexico and become a world renowned Luchador while leading the people in a revolution against the drug cartels? Motherfucker *I quit smoking*. 
""This is essentially what I did. I worked from home at the time so I just let my productivity take the hit instead of taking off from work. Still, I just isolated myself for a bit and it worked. I'm almost three years out, and I feel pretty darn good.""Same here, just said 'this time next week I will be smoke free', and I just did it. It's amazing the kind of tricks your mind will play to get what it wants from you, though. You'll find yourself thinking things like 'I've been smoke free for a week, I can reward myself with just one cigarette'. In my opinion, not listening to my own mind was the hardest part of quitting. ""Good for you! My father couldn't do it this way, he found it way easier with the patches, but I guess to everyone his own :)""While I successfully quite over two years ago with an exact opposite approach - a slow tapering off, I agree with you that cold turkey is probably more effective for most people.

But the important thing is to keep trying different methods until successful."Started at 16 pack every 2 days for 9 years. Moved to Minnesota . winter came. Fuck the cold "I had a similar experience: one day, after a desperate run to the nearby gas station to buy cigarettes, back at home, I suddenly realized how ridiculous this has gotten and just stopped smoking right there and then, ignoring the freshly bought pack and never buying more. 

The week after that was pretty rough, with intense tension headaches and anxiety, but then it all stopped. It just took determination and self-awareness - I doubt any other way would be effective for me. ""True for me. Started smoking in my teens, decided I needed to quit at 24. You really need the motivation, the rest will follow. One practical tip that helped me a lot: know that the (seemingly incontrollable) urge to just throw in the towel and smoke, disappears within 5 minutes or so. Let the urge pass, and reward yourself after - not with a cigeratte preferrably. 

The feeling of selfcontrol is infinately more pleasurable than the few minutes of sucking on a cigarette.""Yep. I was too hungover one day to walk to the shop to buy smokes. Ended up going the day without one. Slept in the next day, went to work, didn't get a chance to get out to buy any, went home, was still hungover. Woke up the next day, realised I'd gone 2 days without a cigarette and thought it'd be dumb to go back. That was 3 years ago. Haven't had one since and that was after 20 years smoking."This. Firstly you have to really want to quit though. Once you get past the third day it's all mental. "I quit cold turkey also--definitely thin it's the best way. I also use a nicotine-free e-cigarette to avoid relapsing. I picked it up a few months after quitting when I wanted to go back. 

I really enjoy being able to puff on something when my friends have a smoke at a bar, etc. e-cig satisfies my habit craving, and tastes better than cigarettes ever did.

I've had people say that's a backslide, but my lungs and I disagree.""1 month into quitting cold turkey and I can get drunk with friends smoking all around me and not get the urge to have one. Sport helped for me, I started bouldering 6 months ago and noticed that my cardio was holding me back, that's what gave me the motivation to stop I think."I've just stopped. "I smoked for seven years, and the only method that worked for me was cold turkey. I tried the gum, patches, hypnosis; the lot. I smoke a cigar on my birthday each year, but other than that I haven't smoked since 2005.""I ""quit"" cold turkey. I didn't smoke for 2 months and by then, the addiction was gone. Even now, I occasionally smoke one or two when out drinking with buddies but I know I'll never go back and buy another pack for myself. 

It's been almost a year and I've had maybe 5 total over that time, all when drinking.""Cold Turkey it is.  I just stopped buying them.  That was it.  It was hard, and I slipped a little by borrowing from friends once in a while, but I was eventually clear and have been for 6 years.  
It also helped that I had kids at that time.  Not sure if you can get a prescription for that, but they work wonders.""Doing the same thing..  3rd week now me and my girlfriend stopped at the same time. Only way we could do it. 

I know from stopping smoking Mary Jane that this was the only way. I quit that habit plenty of times. 

Am doing quite alright I must say..  At work it is the hardest so far.  It was such a nice break from the routine. Now I reddit more ;) 

Keep it up! All of us that stopped! ""This is exactly it. I was a smoker for over a decade, and I tried many times to quit during that period. I never managed to, because I just didn't really want to. I knew that I should but I enjoyed smoking.

Last summer, something just broke in me. I don't even know what the change was, just that suddenly I didn't want to smoke anymore. The cravings still sucked during the withdrawal period but even during the worst of it I had no desire to actually smoke. I'm six months later now and the cravings are mostly gone now.

I strongly believe that people quit when they're ready to quit. No amount of pills or patches will help if you're not there, and if you are there you don't need them."I wonder if I could just apply this to food. I want to permanently be on smaller portion sizes. It's such a pain. "That's how my mother quit, cold turkey. It's been almost five years, now. She used to get really sick a few times every winter, to the point of being unable to get out of bed. Since she stopped smoking, she hasn't gotten sick like that once. Now she's feeling better than ever, and was able to take a more active job."I know a guy who quit cold turkey in his 60s after having smoked since a teenager. One day that was it. No more.Same here. Just one day just quit and never looked back. I also think studies showed within 72 hours the nicotine in your body is already out and cravings should be reduced. "Honestly, I quit the same way! I had smoked for about 2 years steadily and noticed I was short of breath all the time, and at times just felt like crap.  I had to end it.  I decided my vice was the gas station.  Instead of going in to pay for petrol, I paid at the pump.  Not going inside helped immensely.  I just basically removed myself from being able to buy them. I quit in February and have only had a few with friends at the pub.  The last one I had I only smoked 1/4 of it and it tasted nasty!""Cold Turkey here as well.
Smoked for 5 years. Tried everything myself as well, including electric cigs. I'm 4 months free and i'm a happy possum!""That's how my mum quit. Just gave up, that was about 9 years ago. ""I agree, cold turkey, but for me it took failing 3 or 4 times before I was able to quit. I always thought I could quit if I really wanted to, but was only after trying and failing 4 times that I realized it had me really bad, and that I couldn't quit. That extra push of in effect being told I can't is what helped me really say FUCK u tabacco and quit for real. Don't stop trying, but go hard for the goal when you do. For the first 2-3 months it really helps if you don't hang around the people you used to smoke with, that's the worst temptation of all. Just make the sacrifice, and tell them why. You'll be back but need a break from hanging out. 
Welcome clear lungs, the most amazing taste buds (you haven't eaten food since you started smoking I assure you), and your sense of smell. I can pick a wine in a blind taste test just by smelling it now. Once you've quit for long enough I swear you'll no longer crave a cig at all so no work resisting, and once it's been long enough still you wouldn't even be able to enjoy a puff were you to have one. Go for it people, it's awesome!!""I agree. Granted, I only smoked for 2 years but still... my roommates still both smoked so I always had the urge. For the first week or so, I had to ween myself off.. I would bum a cig or two a day until I didn't want/need them anymore.

Nowadays, I socially smoke. I have a couple good friends that smoke and when they visit, I'll light up one with them for their sake, but I never have the urge to buy smokes anymore. 'Tis a great feeling.""I did the same thing. Started smoking when I was 14, quit at 23. Smoked 2 packs a day for most of this period. Decided to stop when I got the flu and went 1 day without smoking. Cold turkey, almost a year ago. Man, the first week is bad, I don't think I slept for more than 2 hours and would think about smoking every 2 minutes. But it goes away, you end up spacing out how much you think about lighting a cigarette. Now I only think about it once or twice a month, usually when I see someone smoking and really enjoying it. Pro tip is: occupy yourself and understand that smoking has a lot to do with anxiety. It's a way of pretending to do something, of filling your time with an activity, be it waiting for the bus or after a nice meal. If you enjoy the actual moment, if you pay attention to yourself and your body, the ways your brain will try to trick you into smoking, all those things, you'll manage to stop. It's funny though, your brain will create the most absurd reasoning for you to have one cigarette - hey man, society ain't the boss of you, why live your life to be healthy, why not enjoy this nice moment with friends by gifting yourself a fine king sized Lucky Strike? - you'll get those moments. But it's useful to learn how much our brain rationalizes stupid choices and it will teach you to pay attention to it in other moments. When slacking off, when making general bad decisions, when you're being an asshole... Most of all, quitting cigarettes involves learning about impulse control and self control, that's why cold turkey is good, because the reward is instant gratification for not smoking. You can count the days, the weeks and the months and know you're winning! Best of luck to whoever is trying to quit and remember: just because you smoked one cigarette while drunk on a Saturday night, it's no reason to buy a pack on Monday morning! ""There is no question about it. Cold turkey is the way to go. All the different shit you can get to help you quit, is all made by companies out looking for money.""Cold turkey here too.

Decide you want to quit. Stop buying cigarettes."One day I decided not to smoke. At the end of the day I reasoned that if I could get through one day I could get through every day after that. End of story. I don't smoke anymore."Personally, I've tried this and failed so hard because I became an supreme asshole. Congrats for pushing through that phase. I know I couldn't. "I quit cold turkey and it worked for me. It's been about 6 years or so and every once in awhile I'll cough and smell cigarette smoke. The reason I finally quit was the price was getting too high. That is spot the fuck on. 6 years for me after going CT as my new years resolution "That's pretty much what I had to do.  Granted, I also had to stay away from anything associated with smoking.  Bars? Nope.  Coffee? Nope.  Friends (especially those that smoke)?  Nope.  Just a lot of time spent feeling shitty, lots of naps, and lots of general crankiness. ""Cold turkey is the only way to go.  If you need a crutch to quit smoking your head is not really where it needs to be to successfully quit.

What finally did it for me was the cost.  Chicago had just raised taxes again on cigarettes so they cost $12/pack.  A $5000/year habit was a bit much so I just said ""fuck it"" and quit.  If I wavered in my resolve I just thought about the money.

In the end it was not all that hard.  I mean sure, I would jones for a smoke (still do on occasion) but I never flipped out over it and that is after 20+ years of smoking.
""That worked for me. But, I also did a few push ups or squats every time I got a craving. It sped my heart rate up just like smoking did, and stopped the urge. "I tried many times to quit and then woke up one morning and hacked up something gross. Threw away what was left if the pack I had and didn't touch a cigarette for a few years. I have one very seldom now. Maybe one every two or three months."I loved to smoke. I loved everything about smoking. I loved the first cigarette in the morning, the cigarette after a meal, the cigarette on the phone, the cigarette in the car. I loved all my smoking accessories, all my cool lighters, my cool painted-enamel cigarette cases, and the ashtrays! Don't forget all the cool ashtrays from all around the world.
At the time that I quit I was smoking 2 packs a day (Kent Golden Light Menthol 100's -- OMG I loved them so much), and there was no patch, no e-cig, no pills. We had the gum and hypnosis, and cold turkey. I chose the latter.
I was a poor college student, living on pennies, when one day I was defrosting the refrigerator (that's how long ago) and saw the brand new carton of cigarettes I had just purchased for $10. (I know). TEN dollars. That was a huge amount of money for me then. Impulsively I took that carton of cigarettes -- brand new, unopened -- and threw it in the garbage with the rest of the old freezer detritus I was disposing of, and hauled it out to the curb.
I did not have $10 to my name to flush down the toilet that way. It made a huge impression on me. As a result I could never bring myself to go purchase a new pack, I just kept remembering, ""I flushed a $10 carton of cigarettes straight down the toilet!"" Quitting sucks, but I never smoked again. It was 31 years this past December.
I still have my favorite enameled cigarette case.""I quit cold turkey, and I'm 1.5 years clean. People don't understand that you have to confront the habit to quit, and you don't really do that with replacement therapy""That's what my dad did about 5 or so years ago, and he hasn't gone back once. However, the one day he did pick to stop was April 1st, so if he ever did smoke again, it would be the one of the greatest (and possibly saddest) April Fool's jokes ever  ""As I've heard, ""The secret to quitting is to just quit"" seems to work. Well, for people who aren't me. Then again, I don't want to quit besides the money aspect.""I got downvoted to hell for saying this the other day but, fuck gum, patches, and eCigs they are all just ways to string you along until your next relapse.  To truely quit you need to remove the psychological addiction as well as the physical addiction.  The physical addiction can actually be overcome in the first few days but the psychological addiction can last for months or years.  After 7 years of smoking a pack a day and dozens of failed attempts at quitting I finally figured it out.  Its going to sound stupid but if you read a book called ""The easy way to stop smoking"" by Allen Carr and you finish the book you will quit smoking.  He basically talks you out of it.  Put out my last butt over a year ago and havent touched any nicotine in any form since.  Im more than happy to answer any questions for anyone who is struggling. Drop that shit and be free!"How long was it until you stopped wanting cigarettes? My concern is I'll just be craving cigarettes for the rest of my life."Pretty much this. I wouldn't say that I completely ""quit"" in that I still light up every once in a while when I'm out at the bars on the weekend, but I quit smoking daily by simply not buying more. Saying fuck it and not making them available is probably the best way. Oh you're stuck at work and want to smoke but you don't have any? GREAT!""I agree. I quit (though have had a few - I can count them on one hand - slip ups at social gatherings where I've drank more than I should have) over a year ago. The only thing that I did to actively NOT smoke was play Persona 4 Golden on my Vita during my breaks at work instead of go outside. I work in a place where a lot of my coworkers smoke, and it was a real problem for me to really be near them on breaks, so I got digital friends to replace them. 

I'm 1/2 kidding about replacing them, but this worked for me, and I couldn't be happier about it.""I quit cold turkey almost a year ago, and i hardly get cravings any more. The first three month were a circle of hell, but after that the cravings just dropped off for the most part. Also, being actually held accountable for it helped me too. My SO told me that if I wanted to continue smoking, he wouldn't like it, but he wouldn't be up my ass about it either. However, if I chose to quit he would hold me to it. I slipped up a couple times at the beginning and some of the worst fights of our relationship ensued. It sucked, but it worked. There were actual, immediate consequences if I smoked, so it ended up being easier to not smoke and not have to deal with the confession and inevitable fight. "You get an upvote from me! Congrats :D"that's it, that's the key.  

Your last sentence.  

If you truly want to quit you will.  

Everyone else that wants to quit wants to do it for the wrong reasons ""My spouse hates it, it's bad for my health""  then they suck down another smoke or sneak another smoke.  

I woke up one day coughing up those nasty loogeys and smoked a cig and thought to myself ""I don't feel shit from this, fuck this""

and thats how i quit because I actually wanted to quit.  

Chantix, patches, gum.  that's for people that wanna look like they are quitting.  Trust me, I was one of them.  ""I was a smoker for almost 9 years, and cold turkey was the only thing that worked for me.  It definitely suck major dicks, but it's effective.  I am glad to see this is the top comment.""Here. Here. Cold turkey, preparation and true commitment. 5 years in and I feel great!""Listen to /u/kirkirus.  I'd smoked for nearly ten years and cold turkey is how I quit. As kirk said, you have to pick a date and stick to it.  It's just like making any major change in your life.  No one and nothing will make you change.  You have to decide to *want* to make that change in your life.  Try to also separate yourself from triggers.  Some are easier to avoid than others, but again, you have to make that decision that this is the life you want to live.  Best of luck to you and anyone else who's in the struggle.  I swear, it gets easier and you and your clothes, furniture, car, house, and loved ones will be happy you did.""I agree.  Cold turkey is the way to go. I also tried and failed MANY times. However my last attempt was cold turkey and its been over three years. Just resist the urges and you will be ok. Its hard, I won't lie about that. But you can do it.""As a French reading the expression cold turkey for the first time, I must say I love it. Cold turkey, with mayo please. ""Can also confirm, Clinical Trials Assistant for Duke C.S.C. headed by Dr. Jed Rose, co-inventor of the nicotine skin patch. "E-cigarettes. Starting off at 24mg nicotine and gradually winding down to 0 mg. I kept smoking nicotine free for a few weeks and finally quit. "Same here, 0mg for a week and done. It was far easier than expected, and I was vaping half a bottle a day! All day every day.""I love e-cig stories. Good for you, man!""I love these stories as well.  I'm down to 6mg myself, starting to look for vendors that will pre-mix 3mg for me."Awesome job! I've been using an e-cig for a little more than a year and it has worked wonders for me too. I just haven't tuned down the nicotine. Now...let's talk about that sugar addiction."So if you smoke a nicotine free e-cig, what do you smoke? And is it still harmful?"I picked up an e-cig instead of smoking. I was heading towards 2+ packs a day. "E-cigarettes were the only thing that did it for me. I still had cravings, but when I was on the e-cig the cravings seemed to lack a certain amount of their normal urgency. Like, I could recognize the craving for what it was, evaluate it, and dismiss it, rather than feeling obligated to give in.""That worked for you? Thats awesome, maybe all my friends are just addicts. They all went for e-cigs, sat on that for a while and now they just smoke a mixture of both...I really don't get it sometimes. NO benefit for them whatsoever"What is the best model/brand of ecig you would recommend? [deleted]"May I ask how gradual? How big were the steps, and how often?""I love ppl who use them to stop an addiction, not replace. Upvote for you.""I decided I wanted to quit. 

Edited:

I would just like to say thank you to everybody who understands and all of the Super duper support. I thought my comment sounded bitchy after I thought about it, but after the overwhelming response, I'd like to tell everybody that you've all done a Super job. Even if you haven't fully quit, taking the step, even if you step back, is very important. Over time, you learn you don't NEED cigarettes. You WANT them. And ultimately you have to decide which you want more. To smoke, or not to smoke. That is the question. 

You know that reddit meme YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE 

Think of that when you get a craving. 

It's been 4 years, I'll be in my 5th in February. You have to understand that life is gonna keep sucking even if you're not smoking. The stress at work won't go away, the frustration in traffic will never stop. Using these excuses is just prolonging your progress. 

I quit while living with, and associating with everybody around me being a smoker. My fiance is a smoker. As long as you keep deciding ""I don't want a cigarette"", then eventually you won't want a cigarette. ""Pretty much how my dad quit 

He literally went ""No more"" and quit smoking""Me too! I just woke up one morning, and was like, this is it. No more. 

Rather frustrating, because I quit in March right after my first ever ""real"" winter in Toronto (having lived in Australia before then). I'd spend the whole winter miserable having to go outside in the snow to smoke, dreaming of Patio season and being able to enjoy a beer and a smoke on a patio somewhere, just sounded amazing. Then right before it was warm enough to do any of that, bam! I decide I can quit? Pain in the ass."Cold turkey + I also substituted it with a different habit. For me it was MMA training. And eating. "That's how I did it. I was hoping this would be the top answer. You really must WANT to quit. Friends of mine have quit for their SO, because of the cost, because of the health issues, all of which have failed because deep down they didn't want to, they enjoyed smoking. ""This is really the best answer. You aren't going to quit unless you decide you are actually going to quit. It's not going to happen if you're just like ehhh I might as well quit today. 

I quit cold turkey two years ago cause I didn't enjoy it anymore, it wasn't worth how it was making me feel and would affect my health in the future, and it was damn expensive smoking a pack a day. I made up my mind I was done with it for good and I haven't had one since. ""This, for sure. In my experience, the gum, patches, and whatnot didn't help at all. I had to really want to quit. When I was finally ready, I gave it up and just chewed regular gum for awhile when the cravings hit.""Not looking for a ""magic cure"" use your willpower, then you only have yourself to blame when it doesn't work and you feel crappy every time you smoke after you fail the first time and you eventually quit""That really is the only way. I had tried to quit several times, but I remember one day I just decoded it was over. It's been over a year now""Exactly. Just because some people have a lack of will power doesnt mean all of us do. ""Cold turkey never works"", nope works perfectly fine if you're strong enough to control yourself. ""I decided to quit, but it still tok a few years of trying on and off before i did quit.  The thing that finally worked was when i realized that my desire to smoke was based on lies that advertisements had put in my head.  All the advertisements make you think that cigarettes are refreshing and relaxing, but for me, I actually felt kind of shitty and anxious after i smoked a cigarette.  After that, quitting was easy because whenever i got the urge to smoke, i understood that the only way i was going to feel refreshed and relaxed was to stay quit.""I'm in the process of moving plus I was sick and out of work for three weeks recently. Cigarettes are $10.50 a pack here in MA, so it was a necessity to stop as I have no extra income to spend on a habit that's going to kill me in the end. 

It's only been a week but I haven't really noticed the switch from cigarettes to my e-cigs I have one of the refillable vaporizers. My sister had the same one and tapered off of it after a month. She hasn't smoked in 3 months now. I am finding that I prefer 'smoking' my e cigarette as 1) there's no smell and 2) I have an unlimited amount of flavor options. My favorite so far is a strawberry/watermelon/pineapple blend.

I've been smoking for 9-10 years, Marlboro Smooth 100s, a pack a day. 

Another great motivational tool: So far I've saved $60-70... monthly I'll save $300-- that means I can feasibly afford a brand new car if I were to continue to stay off cigarettes. Between my boyfriend and I (we both are quitting) that's $600-700--- that's a luxury vehicle payment every month. Or a vacation. 

Good luck to you OP!!!""Same for me. I added patches in to help with cravings, but in the end it was the ultimate determination to quit that did it for me.""When i was younger my dad quit like that mainly because i was developing severe asthma related issues because of his smoking. So one day he just woke up coughing and hacking his lungs out and said to himself ""i cant do this anymore."" Then in the morning he got up and saw me hacking and coughing as well and set up a breathing treatment for me and took one look at his pack of cigarettes and just threw it in the trash never to be seen again. He said it was tough on him to just stop like that but every day he woke up with a craving or anything he knew how worth it it was going to be for him and his family once it was over.""This is the answer. I quit so many times, it was only when I was entirely fed up with smoking, and entirely fed up with quitting that I stopped cold turkey and just went on with my life. Also dill flavored potato chips got me thru the first week. Whatever it takes, just get thru the tough part. "Same. I was tired of smelling bad and wasting my money on $9 a pack. I started smoking American Spirits and they were so strong that they made my stomach hurt. It stopped being fun after that"The only answer! Beyond that though, I'd add two things: 

First- smoke your last cigarette at night as usual before bed. Make sure it's the last in the pack and there aren't more in the home. Tomorrow you wake up and they aren't available. DO NOT buy more (avoiding the whole trip to the store for more is waaaay easier than staring at that cigarette and trying not to smoke it). Some people like to carry around the unopened pack, and that may be fine. But I acknowledged my addiction and had to deny myself access. No available cigarette will go unsmoked. I'd typically smoke em down to the filter, so no butts for me. But these May need to be purged prior to the final night/first day.

Second- have a reason to stay 'quit!' Develop an activity in which Lung-capacity is a benefit. There are plenty of times I 'get the urge' but enjoy being able to breathe even more. Having something stronger than the urge to smoke to hold on to when you're dying for that puff. 

Eventually you'll come across someone that stinks to high hell and you'll know the process is nearing its conclusion. For me this was the moment it all got easy. I really didn't want anything to do with them after the stinky guy, though the urge does come occasionally. And I know I can never have one. One puff would lead to one cigarette. One cigarette to one pack. And I'd be hooked again!""Yeah, I decided I wanted to quit, because I was going to attend a no-smoking campus. Just wasn't worth it to stink up my car or my clothes to satisfy a silly impulse."Thisssss. You have to actually WANT to do it...not just quit because you know you should. You have to legitimately want to quit.No offense but this is a really unhelpful answer."This is also what worked for me. For about a year before I stopped I hate the taste, it pissed me off so much that I had to keep using this thing that I just hated more and more each day. My father was in the hospital and they used a patch on him. He was in there for several weeks and doing just find. So I decided to get a patch and try it out. I only ever used that one patch and then nothing. never craved one and was so damn happy to be rid of that.""I found that with smoking- as with every important change I have made in my life- this was the turning point.  You're an adult. You're not going to do something you want to do if it's readily available and already part of your lifestyle. 

I went from a pack and a half a day to smoke-free on July 19, 2013. I regret nothing.""Same here. I decided I didn't want to be a smoker. I used nicotine patches to help me quit, and kept my mouth busy with sunflower seeds and beef jerky, but the thing that made it happen was that I had decided without a doubt that I wasn't going to be a smoker anymore. ""Patches and smoking joints when I got the urge. After a few weeks you have that stench off you and you can breathe. It's hard to see the trees through the forest, but once you're a little outside of it you'll be able to understand why there's such a negative stigma around cigs. ""This. It also helped to have a wife who also decided it was time to quit, and we fed off of each other's guilt.""My grandpa did that 10 years ago when he was 78, started when he was 16""Came here to say this.  Tried a few times, never took.  One day I decided I wanted to quit.  I FELT the need to quit.  One year later smoke free.  There are no gimmicks, just you."Same here. Pretty much straight will power. I just decided that I hated it and that it was a silly thing to do. The slightly tough part was convincing myself. "Yup. Two years here. You really have to want to quit more than you want a cigarette: every time. It gets easier the more time that has lapsed because you don't want to throw it away for one crappy little smoke. And no cheating! Each puff makes it easier for the next one. If you are sneaking smokes, then you aren't ready yet. ""Exactly. I tried to quit twice, but finally I got to the point where I just didn't want to smoke. Obviously there were physical cravings, but I didn't want a cigarette anymore.""You're ruining the possibility of advertising products the OP could buy, that's not how deceptive marketing works.""I tried ecigs and it didnt work. Ive tried numerous attempts at quitting and I could never do it. I wanted to quit so bad and for the longest time too, but I wasnt ready.

I think your mind and body have to be ready to quit altogether. I woke up one morning and decided i didnt want to die and just quit cold turkey. Its been 4 weeks now and it feels great. U have nothing to lose and everything to gain by quitting. Keep at it and goodluck to ya

Edit: As cliche as it sounds, chewing gum really helps. It just helps satisfy the oral fixation""This. It could be because I wasn't that addicted, but on three occasions I've just quit like that. There's been a good 6 month to 1 year gap where I haven't smoked, and then just picked up smoking. But each time I just quit and never picked it up again. Odd."Funny how it seems the best cure for addiction is willpower. "This.

There is no easy way.  Quitting was probably the hardest thing I've done (and I've passed three bar exams and ran a marathon).  Just decide to do it and do it.  No excuses.

I haven't smoked in over a year -- quit cold turkey.  I relied on exercise (cardio), less drinking (and seeing less of my smoking friends) and a naggy wife.  Also, I will put what I used to spend on smokes in a jar that I call my ""Cool shit"" jar.  I just bought a drum set of CL with the money, which I use to rock out.

Also, don't use eciggies.  Those are stupid looking.  And will likely kill you.""I think above all else, this is how people quit. They may accredit it to other things they were doing (picking up a hobby, exercising, chewing gum ect), but i really think it comes down to genuinely wanting to quit. The same goes for every other addiction out there.





P.S. addiction is not a disease, people. You cant choose to stop having a disease.""This! I quit smoking after being a smoker for several years. I have to admit, that I kind of got sick of smoking and really wanted to stop.""Wife got pregnant, I quit with her. 23 years ago. ""Same here, I quit tobacco and cannabis this way. It sucked, but was totally worth it.. 30 days clean and I'm not looking back. ""Yes!  It doesn't matter what you do to make the transition easier, as long as you have set in your mind that you are quitting.   I quit using patches just to keep the edge off and to keep my marriage in tact. I've been quit for over 3 years and still crave them though.  I still watch people smoke and in my mind they are having the best fuckin' time in the world paling around with their best friend Marlboro.  ""Sometimes it helps to get pushed into taking the decision. I really liked smoking, until I got asthma. Was easy to decide it wasn't worth it at that point; a bit late though.""Truth.  I had to quit for a few months for a medical condition.  I didn't want to, but I also didn't want to fuck up the rest of my adult life because i was too weak-willed to handle 4 months of no smoking.  The day I got the go ahead from my doctor, I bought a pack of delicious cigarettes.  They tasted kind of bad, but I didn't care-- I was back on it.

I did quit.  Successfully.  But I didn't want to stop smoking and until you want to actually stop smoking, you have zero motive to not go out and buy another pack. "Yep. Every part of you must be in agreement that you want to quit. Any part of you that still wants or enjoys smoking or rebels against having to quit will cause you to fail."My girlfriend tells an awesome story about when her (great?) grandfather deciding to stop smoking. He smoked a pipe and while laying brick one day, when he stood up from grabbing some mortar, he hit his pipe on the wall, it jammed his mouth painfully. He essentially just got pissed and said, ""Fuck this shit."" and put it into the wall he was working on. Just decided to Cask of Amontillado it.""This is exactly how I plan on doing it. I know that once I really WANT to quit, I'll be able to. I experienced the same thing when I became a vegetarian years ago. I decided I didn't want to eat meat anymore to be more healthy and I gave up meat easily in a day for 6 years.""This is what my dad did. I've heard him say a few times, if someone really wants to quit, they will just quit. ""Not me but a friend of mine was on jury duty and they were all talking about quitting.  One guy (who was a pack+ per day smoker) said, ""Oh I just used the tequila method."" - everyone just looked at him confused.    
He continues, ""You know how people have that one night with Tequila where it was so bad and they got so sick that even the smell of tequila is too much for them to handle? Well I thought about that and thought that I could apply it to cigarettes.""    
""So I went to the store, bought 3 packs of cigarettes, went home, and then **JUST ATE ALL OF THEM**.  I got so sick that I basically did nothing but throw up for the next 2-3 days.""     
**""I've gotten nauseous at the smell of cigarettes ever since""**""same here. always wanted to quit after graduating undergrad, and stopped the night I got my diploma. something changed when I decided that cigarettes smell bad and not appealing.""I like to think that every ""stop smoking"" campaign is a big conspiracy led by tobacco companies. By constantly advertizing that it is incredibly hard to stop smoking and that you can't do it without nicotine patches or gum, they actually discourage people to do so.

The only thing you need is motivation, it's as simple as that.""Same. Smoked for 10 years. Tried to quit a couple times. Always failed because deep down I did not want to quit. 

You have to actually think about it and really want to quit in order to do it.""This is the one thing people don't realize when they quit. Unless you really want to stop, you're not going to. You'll find some justification for one last smoke. Maybe it's a bad day at work, an argument with family, hell maybe someone just cut you off in traffic. If you want to smoke, you'll smoke, and that's true until you find a reason not to.

You can tell a smoker 100 times it's bad for them and they need to stop, but they'll brush it off every time. When they tell themselves that, that's when we try to quit.

That being said, I've been using an e-cig with decreasing nicotine for the last month. It's not quitting completely, but it's a step in the right direction. Seems to help.""This is what my dad says. He quit because it was his choice and he made it. He quit cigarettes, drinking, meth and has been clean over ten years now. 
"Easy there Charlie SheenThat's what I did too. One day I just ran out if cigarettes and never went and got another pack. Haven't smoked since.Same. I did use the patch for half the time it's meant. I bought one box of each dose just to make me not a total cunt for that time period. 5 years later I sometimes use a hookah at a restaurant "This. When you *really* decide to quit, you will. If you ever feel the urge to go back, just buy a vape instead."I forced myself to believe that the tobacco plant had gone extinct. When I saw people smoking I felt bad for them because they must have been smoking tea leaves or something out of desperation.  It made it easy to get through those first few days and after that it was easy to keep it up."Exactly. Take the decision for good and stay with it. No ""I have to"" or ""I would like to quit"", just ""I quit"" and be done with it. I stopped 8 years ago.

""I picked up smoking at 21(i'm 26 now), my dad smoked (dead now, not because of that bust still dead) i picked it up from my friends... now i smoke 1 or 2 a day... i'm gradualy getting them down, i have days i don't smoke, so i hope i'l get them down to none.""""I decided I wanted to quit.""

This is it. The only way that works. I would add more detail, though. Pills, patches, gum, etc, don't do it. You have to decide to hate it rather than love it. You have to be mindful, every time you feel the urge, to make yourself think of all the things you don't like about it. In my case it was my twice-per-year sinus infections and constant lung cookies that I decided I hated more than I liked the relaxation, the work breaks, etc. I tried the patch twice, and failed. When I decided, mindfully, that I wanted to quit, I stopped cold turkey and I haven't looked back. 6 years and counting now, after a 20 year pack-a-day habit."[deleted]Same for me. Its been a couple weeks now and its been pretty good. Only time i get a craving now is if I've been drinking. "This is exactly what happened with me. My girlfriend had asked me to quit, I tried once, it lasted about 3 months then I went back to smoking. Then last year January 3rd, I just said ""...I think I'm done smoking."" It's tough sometimes because I moved to a small town and fucking everyone smokes here, but no cigarettes for me for a year now.""That's what worked for me as well. I had tried several times to quit before but I would always just tell myself I ""can't"" smoke or I ""shouldn't"" smoke. It wasn't until I reached the conclusion that I didn't ""want"" to smoke anymore that I was actually successful. 

Truthfully it never fully goes away. Seeing people smoke, I sometimes miss the act itself (especially as a way to waste time, driving, appetite suppressor, etc.) but smelling cigarette smoke, or the breath/clothes of a smoker remind why I'm glad I stopped. It's been almost 8 years now. How time flies.""Same for me. Played soccer for 24 years, smoked about14 of them. Stopped from one day to another. Feels so good to freely breathe""I finished my pack and thought ""I'm not going to buy another"". That was about 5-6 weeks ago now and I'm just fine.""Such simple words, yet so hard to grasp for people desperate to quit.""I think that a lot of people try to ween themselves off of smoking. For it to work, you actually have to *want to quit*. You have to commit to it. When you decide to quit, that means you CANNOT HAVE ANOTHER CIGARETTE EVER AGAIN. Ever. For good. Not even one. You have to make that commitment and really want it and believe it. Anything less and you're lying to yourself.""That's how my grandpa quit. Guy smoked for 50+ years, then decided he wanted to quit because his dentist of all people mentioned something about it staining his teeth. After 50 years. He just quit cold turkey then. Admittedly he was smoking ultra-lights, which is pretty much like inhaling air through a nicotine filter. ""I went the same way. During my life i tried to quit several times, but it never worked out, because in my head, i actually did not want to quit. When i finally decided that i actually want to quit, it was quite easy to just stop cold turkey."[deleted]"That's what did it for me.   But I'd qualify that I wanted to quit, and I actually meant it.

You really need to want to do it.  Not just say you do."That helps exactly nobody."Same here, I just decided it was time to quit, no major life events happened, nothing hit me hard or anything like that, I just stopped and that was that. I always feel a little bad saying that when people ask because it's probably not helpful when they're looking for insight or motivation, but it's the simple truth. One day I ran out of cigarettes and I just decided I wasn't going to buy any more, and I didn't, I just stopped. Now, I have an e-cigarette handy for when I really get the urge for a smoke but I only used it once or twice a week. I think when it finally runs out I'm just not going to buy another, same as the cigarettes. I've been cigarette free since Labor day of last year and e-cigarette free since New Years day of this year.""See I would upvote but the problem is, you chose to smoke one day before that. and that's always a downvote. so it cancels out just enough so that i don't downvote you right now"Same here. One day I just decided it wasn't worth paying a company for a slow and painful death."This is honestly the only way. Seriously, there is a huge difference between quitting because you have to or something and quitting because you don't want to smoke ever again.""I also quit this way. Decides that smoking and dipping was destroying me. Substituted with walking around the office and eventually exercise and clean diet. Mind over matter. Every time if wanted a smoke I just said ""not this one time"" vice ""only one more.""""I haven't actually quit-quit, but I have cut down dramatically.  I realized that my nicotine tolerance was so high that I didn't really get anything out of a cigarette other than a cough, so I decided to only smoke occasionally for the experience/flavor.  Now I have 3-4 small cigars/cigarillos a week, which I typically don't inhale at all.""same here.  I had 4 cigarettes left in my pack.  I told my buddy: ""wanna share my last 4 cigarettes? 2 for you, 2 for me?"" I didn't even finish each one half way.  Haven't touched one since.  Zero cravings.  That was almost 2.5 years ago.""There are millions of smokers who have ""Decided to quit"" dozens of times. Everyone who fails at quitting at one point decided to quit. "Me too. After 15 years I went from one day smoking to nothing every again. It just gets better every day. [deleted]"I decided that yesterday. I felt like 'I don't NEED to smoke, I can quit any time' so  yeah, when I finished the pack yesterday, why not now? Let's see how it goes""This is what I did, too. Smoked from 14 to 21 years of age.  One day decided this is filthy, ashes everywhere, bad breath, and is bad for me. Never have had a smoke after making that decision to quit.""yeah if your trying to quit smoking, alcohol, drugs, anything for that matter its never gonna happen unless your trying to quit because YOU want too, not because everyone else wants you too.""I did pretty much the same thing. Had a weekend in Amsterdam and slightly overdid it, then decided that come Monday I'll quit because I wanted feel better/healthier. 

I bought 24hr nicotine patches that Monday but by Wednesday thought that I really hadn't felt like smoking, and I I didn't think it was the patches that helped. Cut the patches, felt the same and haven't had one since. 

I think you'll quit when you really feel like the time is right... Hopefully that happens for you sooner rather later. ""Self control is the only way. But you have to realize that your brain is an asshole, and will bombard you with bullshit reasons to make an exception. Had a real bad day? Life going to shit? You deserve a smoke, you've earned one, a reward for all the shit you put up with. Or you need it to calm yourself, or whatever justification right down to fuck this I don't care anymore I'm just too overwhelmed to give a fuck - your brain will be right there to stab you in the back at your first sign of weakness. So it took me plenty of tries, but finally it stuck. First tries were pretty much just being a moocher, bumming smokes and not buying my own as though physically having them in my pocket were the problem. Then only bumming them on breaks once in a while. Once you reach the point that its only every few weeks or even months it really sinks in how much you stink from having one and that helps. The grossness might take years to overcome the 'one every few months' thing but eventually you are a true non-smoker with no desire left."I've been using ecigs for a bit now. I started off with the equivalent nicotine mg's as what I was smoking a day. Once I run out of the vape juice I go in for a new bottle and decrease the nicotine level by two. I'm now almost completely independent of nicotine. I've had a few cigs here and there and I can honestly say I prefer the taste of the vape over the cigs now. Be strong and good luck!!"This is exactly how my husband quit. Ecigs were more than just an aid to quit smoking, they became a major hobby for him. Along with cutting the nicotine back over time it was a really great way to occupy his mind. He was always tinkering with them, buying some new part and going to local vape shops. It kept him excited about his ecig (so excited he got a few friends to quit smoking and start vaping with him) and distracted from cigarettes. We are about to celebrate the anniversary of his first year without buying a pack. I'm super proud of him!""I started vaping and that broke the social habit of going outside with people since I could do it just about anywhere.  After that, I sort of forgot about it.  I mean, I'd vape when i felt like it, but I felt like it less and less.
I've been nicotine free for a month.  ""I wasn't even planning on quitting. I really thought I would smoke for the rest of my life.

 tried the ecig to humor my husband and now I haven't had a cigarette in over 7 months."[deleted]"Same here, started vaping at 24mg, I'm down to 12 right now.""It's so damn easy to quit with ecigs. It just tastes so much better then smoking, but you still get the nicotine. So many different flavours to choose from, and so many different ecigs to get. This was not just a way to quit smoking for me, it's my new hobby."This. I was a 20 year smoker. I had tried the gums and patches. Then I tried the e-cig...and it worked. I haven't had a cig in eight months. The key for me with the e-cig route was finding a juice that I really liked. Once I get a hold of Bounty Hunter by NLV I never looked back."Chewed tobacco and smoked for about 12 years and quit in 1 day using ecigs. 

Over 1 year clean now without ANY issues. ""Can you (or anyone else) recommend an e-cigg that doesn't weigh the earth? Every single one I've tried is just, so...heavy. Falls out of your hand. A cigarette should not fall out of your hand.

If I could find one that's light, maybe this shit might actually work."Haven't had a cig in 20 months and haven't had an e-cig or nicotine in about 2 or 3 months.  They worked for me!  Started at 18mg and worked down to 0mg nic over 18 or so months."This is almost exactly what I did.  I started with an 18mg bottle, then when that was done, I went to 12mg, then 6mg, and finally, 0mg.  After a while, I stopped carrying the ecig with me because I found I almost never used them.  It's been almost a year ecig-free and a year and a half since I had an ""analog"".""I figured I'd find a post about e-cigs in here... And yep, that's how I quit. I was almost smoking 2 Canadian packs of cigarettes a day after 11 years of smoking. I've been doing e-cigs exclusively for the last 2 years.

The e-cigs have their ups and downs, after all they're not as simple as just lighting a rolled up bunch of plant matter on fire, but I feel a whole lot healthier and I look like a time travelling bounty hunter from the future.""This is the only thing that came keep me away from real cigarettes for months at a time. That is to say, I can enjoy e-cigs while I'm drinking or when I'm with other smokers and not be tempted. Those types of situations will otherwise get me every time if I'm just cold turkey."[deleted]Using a brass atomo clone with a Russian 91% right now. Good on you for quitting. Been about a year since I quit myself."I started smoking at 16, started quitting at 27. Quit many times for durations up to 10 years. Went 2 years after using gum and first generation e-cigs for 6 months. A little over 2 years ago I gave e-cigs another serious try. Had one cigarette on day 2, didn't enjoy it or finish it. I'm pretty confident I will never use tobacco again.

My impression is that e-cigs are ""half quitting"", there were some cravings and withdrawal symptoms, but now I can go hours without using, and like so many others, have reduced the nicotine levels considerably. I introduced a friend to e-cigarettes and he quit everything after a year, apparently with little difficulty.""This! I was a heavy inhaler of 2 1/2 packs a day, currently smoke about 3 puffs a cig in morning (have not yet today!) and 3 puffs or so in evening, everything else is vaping now.

Kanger EVOD is a pretty good device, but I will probably get one I can up the voltage on to get a bigger throat hit.""My wife used the Nicotrol inhaler (you suck through a nicotine filter), and it uses gradually lower doses.  After a while, she wasn't even using a cartridge, just needed the felling of the 'cig' in her hands.  It's been 9.5 years, and she still gets cravings sometimes, but hasn't smoked since.""Yup!  I got an electronic and quit smoking tobacco literally over night.  That's from smoking about 30 cigarettes every day for about six years.  Speed up eight months, and I still had a pack of cigarettes with two left in it from that day, hadn't bought one since, and I just threw it out.  Now it's been about a year and a half since I had a cigarette.""Ecigs are also great if you're often in situations where you're tempted to smoke.  Instead of bumming a cig at the bar and going down the usual spiral to smoking again, you can smoke your ecig, not be miserable around other smokers, and not be (very) tempted to smoke.  ""What people are failing to specify here is that the ecigs which are piddly lookalikes at Walmart and the local Quick-E-Mart are nothing short of terrible. 
If you're going to try the ecig as a means to quitting, I recommend buying something refillable and ugly.

Its ugly, yes but the vapor produced will be closer to a hookah smoke than a cigarette. After only a few days the transition becomes very easy. The cigarettes flavor pales in comparison to a good juice, you notice immediately that your clothes do not reek of cigarette and you seem to have more money. 

The choice of ecig is truly the most important part in the beginning. I like kanger, ego and itaste brands for batteries and I highly recommend the kanger pro tank mini 2 as a bottom load cartridge. To make it more durable, pick up a kanger T3s tank and use the plastic tank on the larger base for improved airflow.

As far as liquid, the pompeach, razzleberry and sweet tart flavors from smokeevapor.com are hands down the best I have tried. I have many friends who have switched to ecigs and they all seem to love any variation or combination of those flavors.

Ecigs can be complex and frustrating but once you have made that switch for a few weeks the taste/hassle of cigarettes is just no longer appealing. 

I am sorry for formatting/spelling, I am typing on my potato.""Yeah, I've managed to quit cigs after a few tries by switching to ecigs. A *huge* part of it, though, is you have to really want to quit. So much so that this desire is much greater than your cravings. I think otherwise it doesn't work that well. What helps me is realizing smoking is a very unattractive habit and girls are usually turned off by it (it's certainly not an attractive look for girls either. Furthermore, it is kind of a ""masculine"" thing). I also visualize the smoke, tar, carcinogens, entering my body and irreparably damaging my body and building up gross, smelly, phlegm in my lungs and making my already yellow teeth even more stained. I try to remember the times that smoking actually felt gross even as a smoker (usually when I felt satiated but kept smoking because I felt a need to finish the cigarette). Lastly, being the stingy guy I am, I remember that I've invested in this ecig rig and I would feel stupid if I resorted back to smoking. I hope this helps, good luck.""I also used an e-cig to help cut down on that craving. I didn't regulate as much as you did with the nicotine, only used ""light"" dosage filters.  I also cut down on drinking because the first thing I would always want a drink or two in would immediately be a cigarette. Between that and immediately after eating were the two hardest habitual times to not be smoking. However, this March ill be 5 years cigarette free.""Best thing about ecigs is they are so much cheaper than normals. The juice where I buy it is 10 bucks a bottle and lasts about 2 weeks for me. Replacement coils are 10 dollars for 5 and they last about 2 weeks as well each, so that's 6 dollars a week which is about the price of a single pack of cigs...which lasted 2 days on my old habit. Really wonderful way to step down the nicotine while not really ""sacrificing"" anything. Super helpful when going out drinking as well.""I quit using ecigs a couple of years ago. I didn't even have any real desire to quit. I just decided to try one, then when I ran out of juice I decided not to buy anymore. Virtually no will power was required. I found it real easy, which was a huge shock, because I was perfectly happy being a smoker, to be quite honest. Nice to be smoke free, and to have more money in the bank, though. ""E cigarettes worked immediately for me. I got my first starter kit in th mail on feb 14, 2012 and I've had less than 10 cigarettes since.   

It wasn't hard. I had one or two cravings in the first couple days and then it was clear sailing.  

They have become a hobby, I love vaping even if i end up saving less money than I could have. I really don't understand why anyone smokes anymore with how awesome vaping can be. 

Ps:  fuck disposables. "Started vaping at 12 down to 3. Gonna hit 0 next time I get more. Then it'll just be breaking the puffing on something habit"Yup. Electronic cigarettes are definitely the way to go, especially if other methods have failed. It's been completely painless, and after a year of not smoking, my body is in such better condition.""Pack every 2 days for about 8.5 years, for 3 of those over 1PAD. Tomorrow I'm hitting 5 months with no slip-ups thanks to /r/electronic_cigarette 

I think it's important to realize that there's going to be times where you're still craving a cigarette, and that it's not a total cop-out switching to vaping. Nothing is going to replace the... experience(?)... of smoking a cig, but it can help lower your nicotine dependence as well as get the tobacco chemicals (sans nicotine) out of your lungs. "I smoked 24 years. I was a chain smoker. Got my first ecig little over 2 years ago and instantly stopped smoking. Also went for minimum nicotine. I'm guessing I'm more hooked on the habit. I have not had a single cig after I quit and have no desire to either. On the other hand I have no intention of stopping vaping. My protank 3 is just arriving in the mail atm. :)"I did exactly this and when I got to the lowest nicotine level they sell (6mg) I started buying 0mg fluid and blending it 50/50 with the 6mg and continuing to dilute it until I was at about .5mg of nicotine.  Then I just sort of stopped using it.  I was decreasing the dose over the course of about 2 years, cutting it down every few months or so.  After about a year of using the ecig, I couldn't even handle analog cigarettes; they just were gross to me and I vastly preferred the ecig.  I haven't had an analog cigarette in like 4 years now.  I still have the ecig and 0mg fluid so if I'm going to be drinking anywhere that a lot of people are smoking then I can just bring it with me but I very rarely even do that anymore.""As somebody who successfully quit with an e-cig, the most difficult drop off is when you stop using the e-cig (even if you have been using juice without any nicotine).  The fixation is just as powerful as the nicotine addiction.  For me, it helped to be able to tackle them separately, but do be prepared for that"I'm still having trouble figuring out the dosage of ecig to what I would smoke in cigarettes.  I feel like if I dont know the equivalent dose I'm just gonna keep ripping down vapor till I turn into a mummy. Any suggestions on figuring out doses?"Me hat is the health risk of using an e-cig? The harm of the smoke is taken out, so what exactly is left?"But now I'm vaping. I want to quit all habits.Did unread somewhere that those are linked to stomach cancer?"The only downside, is you should look at an e-cig as an e-pipe. Keep it clean, and you will enjoy it. You can get a lot more usage out of an e-cig cleaning with high % alcohol (a trick I learned from a GGG vape-shop owner). Don't vape everywhere though, because people seem to get pissy about it. You can explain all you like, but they will get pissy. It may not be your thing, just keep trying. Patches, gum, hypnosis, e-cigs, try them all, find *your* way to quit. Good luck!""Same here.  I've been using ecigs for a little over a year.  I've tried a couple cigarettes since, and I truly can't stand them.

A good start would be an eGo Twist and an Kanger EVOD or T3.  I upgraded to a Sigelei Zmax v3, and use the same clearomizers, and I've been very happy with that setup.  ""I smoked cigarettes for 25 years.  Tried everything to quit - cold turkey (no willpower), Chatinx (wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy), lozenges, gum, patches . . .

I decided to throw out my cigarettes on a Thursday night, and only allowed myself to use an electronic cigarette beginning the next day.  It. Worked.  No looking back - I haven't smoked a single cigarette in almost 3.5 years.  

Now - I can breathe.  I can run.  I can ride bikes with my son.  I can smell - OMG, forgotten smells were overwhelming (especially cigarettes, not judging . . . ).  And taste. Food smells wonderful.

Vaping WORKS.  And Boomer lives! =)
""careful with those ecigs, they can contain way more nicotine and get you even more addicted.""I get voted down everytime I say this, but it is worth mentioning; I know a lot of people who have ""quit"" using E-cigs, but no one who has quit their nicotine addiction. My friends who use E-cigs almost all still smoke the occasional cigarette. They use their E-cigs all the time and if they go without them for a few days, they will generally smoke cigarettes in the mean time. 

When I used the patch, the gum, the lozenges, etc in the past, I was still imbibing nicotine, and when I didn't have it the cravings returned at their normal rate (results may vary).

So please take note OP and anyone who wants to get off nicotine, while E-cigs are probably better in some regards, you may find yourself trading one way to satisfy an addiction for another. ""E-cigs... they got you man. Still paying for nicotine. And when you're running the 0mg juice, you'll be paying them for water vapor. Just quit. "[deleted]"I only quit when I got really sick from bronchitis and literally couldn't smoke a single cigarette for a week. After that I just kept up with it.

The cravings don't totally go away tho. I still have them, especially when I drink. ""It is different for every one. After a week of cold turkey I had to go back to work at a bar where every coworker smoked and I'd have to serve people outside while they were smoking. Two years now quit and absolutely zero cravings but the cravings almost completely stopped after 4 months. I got used to being around smoke and now am disgusted when its around me and when I have to work around it... which I have to do often. I can't believe I was so disgusting smelling. :( also, grats on quitting! ""Same here, I was a casual smoker and that made it oddly difficult to quit. I came down with bronchitis and tried to smoke and it was so painful that I put them down and never picked them back up. You're right though, I still want one most of the time. ""I got bronchitis too, was still able to smoke (I'd smoked unfiltered cigarettes for a while and so filtered cigarettes were like light cigarettes are for most people) but I didn't look forward to getting bronchitis every year so I quit. 

I used the patch and acupuncture and some lung healing herbs at the same time. 

And yeah, I still crave cigarettes. It's been 14 years.""It took me dozens of bouts of bronchitis before I quit. I couldn't shake the thought that I was going to get COPD or emphysema. After about 15 serious attempts, (where I quit longer than a month, once after a whole year) I finally gave it the boot.

I think it's been 4 or 5 years now, the cravings are almost entirely gone, it's something I'll never go back to, but the sauce will always make me crave a smoke.""I'm honestly okay with the fact that I'll drink when I smoke. I started drinking and smoking at around the same time. It's just maybe one or two a week, which, sure, isn't the best for me, but I used to smoke a pack a day. I don't even enjoy cigarettes anymore when I'm sober...my lungs hurt and I hate the smell that sticks to you. Drunk me doesn't mind though and I've just kind of accepted it. ""I've never been a true smoker but because in college I bummed smokes when I drank, I now crave the nasty fucking things when I've had more than 2 beers. I guess it's 'karma' for being a bum.""I read a free pdf copy of the book ""The Easy Way to Quit Smoking"" by Allen Carr & quit cold turkey...I also followed /r/stopsmoking around that time (where I found the book), I haven't had or wanted a cig since March 2013.

I am not overly techy and not sure if I missed something but no idea how to find out who you are.  But thank you...you made me smile, as my husband was big on random acts of kindness, and felt like a little bit of him is still out there.....Mwah kind stranger!""Up vote. Allen Carr. The easy way to quit smoking audiobook for me. If you make it through the book you will quit at the end. If you don't you won't. Simple as that.  No withdrawls, cold turkey. It really is in your head. This book lets you realize that. It really was easy. "Smoker for six years here. Finished this book and quit smoking immediately. "Upvote, I can confirm.  6.5 months clean after 20 years of smoking.

I've bought the book 3 times to give to friends.  Best money ever spent.""This book changed my life. I smoked a pack a day for twenty years and stopped cold turkey after reading this book over the course of a weekend. No bullshit. No scare tactics. No diagrams of diseased lungs. Just truth. 

It all came down to two things:  
-I had to *really* want to quit. For me, not for anyone else. 
-changing my perspective. This book made me realize that smoking did nothing for me except get me through to the next cigarette. It appealed to my logic, and it worked. 

Stopping smoking was easy. I had been brainwashed into believing I'd be miserable and it would be futile. It really was easy and every withdrawal pang I got just made me feel stronger and better. 

"Same. I dipped Copenhagen for 14 years and smoked at least a pack a day for another 8 years. I never thought I'd be able to quit nicotine but that book really did work. Today is exactly five months smoke free. Tonight I had a few beers with a buddy. He smoked a few cigarettes and I was never even tempted. "OP, this is what you need. 12 year smoker, and read the book while smoking. As soon as I finished the last page, I put my cig out and threw away the pack, haven't smoked a cig since February 8th, 2013 (almost a full year!).  I also gave the book to my mom, a smoker for 47 years, who finished the book in two days and never had another cig since.

I must say though, the book's message is very simple and is repeated in just about every paragraph in the book.  It's not religious in any sense, and it's not using some scare tactics, but the concept is common sense, so it will start to feel really repetitive and stale after about the second chapter, but it's very important that you finish the book.  

I think it's necessary that you keep reading (or re-reading if necessary), so that the message is ingrained in your skull.  I feel like its trying to brainwash you into undoing the brainwashing that smoking did to you.  Worked, but you need to want to quit for it to succeed.""Smoked for 12 years, quit after reading the book (3 times in a row, I'm a slow learner, but wasn't going to give up).

Smoke free since 8/13/12.""I read that and wanted to keep smoking just to spite him. He annoyed me so bad and I have no idea why. He just seemed to spout bullshit for the entire book.

That said when I did eventually quit I think I did employ some of his ideas subconsciously. ""Same here, smoker 6 years, read the book and quit. ""Any chance of uploading that PDF to another site? Getting a 404 error when I follow that link, but I've heard of this book many times and would like to give it a shot."Interesting. Saved.I just bought the Kindle Edition. About the cost of a pack of cigarettes. Reading now. Thanks!"Ex-smoker for 10+ years, 1/2 - 1 pack a day...

Yes, me too. I remember when I started listening to this audiobook, I totally didn't believe in it, and I didn't even want to give it a shot. After randomly deciding to give it a try, I just listened to this and was ready to quit. It's very effective because it focuses on the physiological AND psychological traps that can keep one smoking.

At the end of the book, his final words of advice are to never smoke a cigarette ever again. I knew this advice was true, but I wanted to test my will power. After quitting for 10 months, I tried to see if I could be a social smoker again, but I just picked it right back up and became a regular smoker again. I knew I'd still eventually quit because this book equipped me with the mindset needed to quit. Months later when I felt it was time to quit again, I decided I'd quit forever and did so. I haven't smoked for more than two years now and never plan on going back. 

E-cigarettes don't even attract me. "yep. this book is the best."This book changed my life as well. I quit immediately after reading it for the first time. I then read it again while going through the withdrawals. I also bought a copy for my dad and my sister. Literally, the best $10 I've spent. ""Finally finished the book a few months ago having bought it years ago. Stopped on the same day and haven't looked back since. Sounds like some serious mindfcuk but it wasn't, the book just helps you realise why you smoke and why it doesn't make sense to continue.""Quit after smoking for 8 years, with a 2 pack a day habit. I read the paperback book ALL THE WAY TO THE END in one sitting and quit the next day. No withdrawls. No pangs. Never looked back. I've passed the book along to several friends and they have all had similar success. I will actually pay for the book for people on one condition: if they quit, they pay for someone else's book. I know it sounds dumb, but this $12 book changed my life. If you want to quit, you can if you read the entire book.""I've heard of this book multiple times over the last 10 or 15 years. Every time I hear about people claiming it helped them quit smoking, I poo poo the thought, in spite of never having seen it, let alone Reddit.

Just the few comments above mine here (as this will get buried) has prompted me to get serious and read the book. Thanks for this comment.

(*Wish I could tip /u/teenagewelfaremother with some dogecoin in this subreddit*)""I kept setting dates and cutting back and making deals with smoking friends and nothing worked for me.  Then I read ""The Easy Way"" and smoked the entire time I read the book, I had one last cigarette, finished the book and never looked back."THIS is the answer"Two packs a day, twenty years smoking and this book really helped a lot. Smoke-free for three years. ""Chiming in to +1 Allen Carr.
His approach makes you glad to be quitting smoking!
It's essentially a mixture of opening your eyes to all the denial and bullshit that you make yourself believe when you smoke; and helping you go cold turkey without the common pitfalls.

Everyone looking to quit, give it a shot. It was a great help for me!
Smoke free for 3.5 years now, and I'm never going back!"Agreed. Alan Carr's book has some great mental excersizes that help with the overall process of quitting. His book helped me to not only quit but to help me think properly when a craving to light up again hit. "That was how I did it. Carr flipped a switch in my head. 

When I started having a nic fit, that was not my body saying ""I want a cigarette."" My body was saying *""I don't want to want cigarettes anymore.""* 

The easiest way to get rid of that anxiety is just to quit. ""Book didn't work for me. Did the course, was cynical as fuck about it working but it did. Twenty year habit, two hour course, not smoked since. That was 8 years ago."Carr's book made me quit for 2 weeks 5 years ago."Allen Carr's book in a nutshell: ÛÏEvery cigarette you smoke creates the ÛÏneedÛ for the next one, so just stopÛ. Ridiculously simple, but true.""Yep another one for the Allen Carr book - worked on the mental addiction so you never have to worry about cravings or feel like you're missing out and sacrificing something. Changed my life, my husbands, and many others I know."This book made me quit!That book worked for me. Smoked for 10 years and haven't wanted a cigarette since reading it 3 years ago. I don't even see myself as a former smoker. It's really weird to imagine that I even smoked before. "Easyway. All the way. I got halfway through the book and realised I was never going to smoke again. 7 years later, and I still haven't. Read it all the way through, preferably in one go and you won't smoke again. 

I've bought many copies for friends and it's worked for them too. ""I read this book and it did absolutely nothing for me. It was full of info any long term smoker already knows, and it's very patronizing.""3 of my friends tried to quit reading the book, 2 succeeded, 1 didn't. 1 other friend was too afraid to read the book because he didn't want to quit smoking. I quit out of competitiveness with them saying i didn't need a book to quit smoking. In hindsight their quitting attempts were a lot better than mine, but still im smoke free since september 2012""Never smoked but I read the book just to see why it was so successful in helping people quit, I believe it's the most effective method of quitting.

One of the highest voted comments suggests quitting cold turkey, if you really want to stop you can, but I think this book is useful for the people that don't think they want to stop. I think the biggest problem for most people is they don't actually want to stop, they just think they ought to stop. What the book does is explain that you actually want to stop, even though you think you don't""I also found this book powerful. Mind you, I failed several more times before I succeeded after reading it but it put the role of cigarettes in my life into perspective. Cigarettes aren't good or calming; instead, the absence of them is upsetting. I found the idea of being nicotine's bitch unpleasant and unforgettable. "I'll be 4 years in May from that book."This.  I had to read the book twice though. The first time I read it, I KNEW that it was the answer, but I wasn't quite ready yet and a year later I was smoking again.  When I was really, REALLY ready, I got another copy of the book (if you like printed books, get it used for less than $4 on Amazon), I took the book and a pack of cigs and sat in my truck and read almost the whole thing in about 6 hours.  When I was done, I was gratefully, thankfully, painlessly done with cigarettes.  I have not had a single puff in at least 6 years.  

As someone else said, if you want to quit, and you read the whole book, you can quit without pain.  

I was the guy who made everyone else feel better about their smoking habit because I smoked so much, if it worked for me, I guarantee it can work for you. ""Yep, I read that book too and it worked for me as well. I meant to order another book by the same author but ended up with his smoking book instead and figured I may as well read it. No cigarettes since October 31, 2013, and I haven't wanted any. ""I am a professional quitter and hands down, this was by far the easiest way for me. But go to a seminar instead of the book if you can. 5 hours (which you smoke through) and you walk away simply never craving one again. As a smoker, that never made sense till I went. You still go throug minor withdrawals, but they are a cakewalk and short lived compared to the other ways I tried."How could I buy this for my SO without it seeming horrible? "I quit with the assistance of Alan Carr's book in 2007 and never smoked another cigarette. I was a 10+ year pack a day smoker and none of my friends thought I could ever quit. got the book a day after a failed attempt at quitting and I really quit about halfway through reading it (it actually encourages you keep smoking if you still are and to quit when and if you have come to the decision yourself) I did finish the book and proceeded to give a copy to about 6 friends mine who were also smokers. Happy to say 5 of the six are still now non smokers. the 6th has worse drug problems.

The funny thing about reading all of the above posts is how everyone who talks about how great and important will power is in quitting also always mentions how they still miss smoking. Look at the people who quit by understanding that they never needed (what Alan Carr's book shows you) and they never mention or complain about missing smoking. I can 100% honestly tell you that I don't miss it or even really think about it at all after. It was somewhat hard for the first month but now smoking is just something that I realize I started because I was a dumb teenager and stopped because I realized I actually did not need to smoke in order to have fun, go drinking, deal with stress or any of the other things smokers condition themselves into believing that they need cigarettes for.

Some people who quit using a different method have unfairly labeled people who read this book as brainwashed. In reality this book provides a way to un-brainwash yourself. (I love this now dead man)"Yep! This book (in combination with a hypnotherapy session) worked for me! It's been 6 years."My brother recommended this to me, because it helped him quit smoking.  I found that while I was reading the book, the desire to smoke did go down a little, and cigarettes started tasting and smelling funny as I went along.  So, I thought that was neat.  But I still lit up after I was done.  This has however helped me in regards to where I am now, looking at cigarettes the same way I did when I read the book.  Apparently it just took a few years to sink in, I guess."Worked for me as well. It's essentially cold turkey but with a positive spin of telling yourself that you're way better off now - which is true."I was at the point where I was ready to quit, reading this book just gave me the nudge I needed, it is repetitive but that is the trick. I finished my pack half way through the book haven't bought one since, 255 days ago.  I will admit, I did fuck it up one night when I was drunk and forgot I was a non-smoker, it actually was a nice reminder though because I felt like a bag of shit the next day and the next time I got drunk it was a non-issue, I just had to remember that quitting is easy."Me too. Smoked for 20 years."just gonna add to this thread that this book made me quit cold turkey.  After 8 years of smoking, I gave it up just like that.  I had attempted to quit a few times before this but never lasted more than a few days.  ""Another ex-smoker that quit cos of the book reporting in. Quit the day I read it, started again 6 months later, then quit for good 6 months after that. Been smoke free for about 8 years now. It took me a while to really get what the book talks about but it did it's magic in the end.""Me too! Read this book on a whim haven't touched a cigarette in 2 years.  It's worth a try, is all I tell people.""Just throwing my two cents in about this book. I smoked for six years; the day I quit smoking was the day i finished reading this book. I flipped a switch in my brain that changed the way I thought about smoking, and that made it ridiculously easy to quit smoking. I just didn't want to smoke anymore!  ""Would give this a million upvotes.  It helped me quit.  I do think you have to be ready and committed to quit (not just saying ""I'll try.""), but this book really helps seal the mindset needed to STAY quit.""Yep. I was a smoker for 15 years and stopped smoking at page 52. Basically you just need to let the book brainwash you. Thats it. 
""This is how I quit after a pack a day for 7years, everyone who mentions Allen Carr gets an upvote!

we need to upvote this pdf past all of the eCig nonsense above""That's what I used too.  Had smoked for 17 years and read it and quit with  no cravings at all, just a had a few times where I went to grab for a cigarette out of habit and then remembered I no longer smoke.  Will be 3 years in May. ""I've been without a cigarette for almost a year now.  Saw this post. Control-F ""The Easy Way."" 

 You won't understand or believe it until you finish the book.  It's exactly what everyone else is saying. The book makes it ""easy"" to stop.  At least it takes away the need for willpower.  I've quite a handful of times, but this was the first time that it FELT GOOD to quit.

And I think the success rate for those that read the book are around 40% long term.  The national average is somewhere around 4-7%.  ""2 pack a day smoker for 15 years.  Quit the day I finished this book.  It was still a struggle the first few weeks - and there were tears.

I also used Silkquit to track the $$ I wasn't spending and bought myself awesome stuff each week using the amount saved.""I read ""The Easy Way"" as well, and just like you, quit cold turkey. I was actually amazed at how good it felt as I was quitting! I was free from the second I finished the last page of the book.

The only hard part about this is that I cannot or the life of me convince my friends to read the book so that they too can feel free. They are too scared that it will work and they wont be allowed to smoke anymore.""This. That book just did it for me. I was over 2 packs a day and I managed to just stop the minute I finished reading it. Even more importantly, I have had not one single craving, and its been damn near 4 years."That book didn't work at all for me. "Smoked for 7 years, read this book in 3 days and quit smoking. That was nearly 2 years ago now and i've not smoked at all since. Fantastic book.""Nice thing is he encourages you to smoke as you read it so you can focus.

There's a story he tells about making a friend turn a boat around to go back for his smokes then being too ashamed to even smoke one. That really hit home.""This.  Karr's book has changed my life.  I keep several copies around to give to any smoker who shows the slightest interest in giving it all up.

Karr knows it because he lived it."Upvote to you sir. I too used this book. I remember somewhere in the book stating that you should keep smoking while reading it. I took a day and half to read it while smoking and when I was done reading the book I was done with smoking. I smoked from 16 - 32. Quit cold turkey with the help of the book. I am now 42 and have been smoke free for 10 years. I occasionally will still get the urge to light up and I still shove a pen in my mouth like a cigarette while working but I do not smoke.OP. listen to him. I used to smoke around 45 cigs a day. Quit after reading the book. Been a year and a half. "Came here to say this, though didn't follow anything on reddit. This book really doesn't get enough exposure. For me it changed my mindset from quitting, or giving something up, to stopping and gaining my life back. Really that simple."That site doesn't exist."Your link did not take me to any book.  It took me to godaddy.com, where I could buy the domain name.  I will google, though, because I'm intrigued.  I've never heard of this book, and now I want to know.""I'm vaping these days (god I hate that word) but Allen Carr was enormously useful the last time I quit seriously. The key point of the book, for me, was this: The way you feel when hitting that first cigarette after a break or a meal or whatever? That's how non-smokers feel *all the time*. Once you're addicted, getting your fix just brings you back up to ""normal."" He equates it to bashing your head against a brick wall so that it feels good when you stop. "This gets my vote as well. I picked up the physical copy (cause I love having a book in my hand) and I've passed it along to three other people who quick successfully and easily with it."This worked for me too when nothing else did, and I was a stubborn heavy smoker. 

Just read it with an open mind, and allow it to convince you to stop. I actually ended up enjoying being able to resist the cravings, and bizarrely it made quitting a fairly pleasant experience for me."I see this book is available on Amazon for like $10 and you seem to be a fan.  So when you were successful at quitting based on what was in the book did you go back and toss the author a few bucks?  "Interesting that his ""Easy Way to Quit Drinking""   (Or ""Easy Way to Control Your Drinking"" which, oddly, is the same book with an alternate title)   ...     isn't nearly as effective as the Smoking book.""This should be at the top. I still read it every 2/3 years when I feel it's notions are starting to fade a little bit.

It basically helps a smoker to really understand what smoking and it's urges are, and helped to realize how brainwashed I were about it.
""I'm glad it worked for other people, but I really, really, really hated that book. It was awful. It didn't speak to me at all, and I didn't quit with it. When I switched to an e-cig, I immediately stopped smoking. Haven't had a cigarette in over a year and a half, and I've brought the nicotine down consistently (I'm going down to the lowest, 0.6% from a start at 2.4%). ""This book made it so easy to quit. After finishing it I really didn't have any cravings. It was so nice to be able to quit and not feel like I was putting up a ""fight"" every day. I actually didn't want to smoke or feel the need to anymore. It basically de-programs you so that you don't think you need to or want to anymore. Read it!""> http://thepreppersite.com/uploads/Allen_Carr-Easy_Way_To_Stop_Smoking.pdf 

hey the link went down, I'm interested in reading it if you can fix it"This should be above the top rated 'cold turkey' response. It's the best way to quit cold turkey."After trying the patch, gum, etc. This was the only thing that worked. The Easy Way by Allen Carr is an amazing motivational tool. It really breaks down the misconceptions of nicotine brought on by addiction. I quit 4 years ago using this book and still going strong!""Yup, this for me as well. I had only smoked for about 5 years when I quit, but my mother read the book and quit after 25 years of smoking. 
It's not magic though as I have some friends who failed and went back to smoking after reading and quitting. You have to not want to smoke I think to succeed. ""This book was under a pile of stuff in my room, four feet away from me as I read this. If it's as good as everyone says then maybe I'll dig it out but it does seem to have that horrible self-help book quality to it though. 

""Do you want to be the best version of yourself possible, without actually doing anything at all? Then buy my book and all the pain will go away, I promise"""This book changed my life. That was 8 years ago. I've bought this book five times since then to give to people. They have also quit. "Yup, Allen Carr is a genius. I have no willpower, but the way described in this book does not require you to use your willpower at all. It's really extremely easy to quit. Just read the book. It's poorly written, but just get through it.""I came to the thread to say exactly this. 

A thing that helped me a lot with the cravings at the beginning was the advice from the book to look at my watch and realize that time is passing thus the craving will come to an end very soon. Before you know it you are over the hump.

""Ah, read that, didn't do a thing for me.  Vaping for the win.""He quit smoking in middle age, but decades of smoking 5 packs a day was just too much and he died from lung cancer at 72. When he was sick, he said something to the effect of ""It's worth it because of all the lives I helped save.""

His book has saved a lot of lives, possibly including mine. It's not the best-written book in the world, but it was exactly what I needed. 
"This comment is way to far down. Mr.carr has seen me through almost 3 years of a smoke free life. Second that. I'll be 2 years nicotine free in June (smoked for 8 years) and I just skimmed the damn e-book. It reads like self-help foo foo but it helped me reframe nicotine and realize that cigs really did have me by the balls."Finished the book 4 days ago amd havnt smoked in 4 days (never will either, im a non smoker)

You cam get it for free - it doesnt hurt to read it. I didnt really want to quit when I started reading, was mostly just curious - but by the end I threw all mu cigarettes amd lighters away with a smile on my face.

Try it - worse that can happen is you lose a few hours reading a book""Had to re-read the ending a few times. Smoker for 10 years. Quit for 2, had a few month bump in the road, read the book again and it's been almost a year now. No cravings or breakdowns that tend to happen when using other methods. Good luck!!  "Same here. Nobody ever believes me though. My mother and sister read the book also and didn't quit. I gave it to my dentists secretary and she quit :)This book helped me solidify my decision to quit but I won't say it wasn't still difficult at times. It was really hard at first not to think about cigarettes even if I didn't want one. But 2 years later and I rarely think about it. "I needed you to know something... I read this thread and read this book because of your review of it. I have been 10 days without a cigarette, and have zero desire to ever start again. Thank you for your comment. I really never thought I would stop smoking... Really. This changed my life, and I thought you should know. 

"10 years cold turkey thanks to Allen Carr"I wrote a $2000 check to the Westboro Baptist Church and handed it to my closest confidant and said, ""If you even hear about me smoking or using any sort of nicotine, you have to mail this in. In one year, you can return the check to me and I'll reevaluate.""

I failed quitting at least 20 times before this. With this method, it was by far the easiest time I ever had quitting, I had stakes in the game. I couldn't afford to lose. I couldn't lie to this guy and sneak one either, guilt would be my own hangman.

Note: Cravings never go away, they just become easier to ignore. It's been 8 months and the last time I thought about smoking was yesterday. """"God hates fags!""    Fags being british slang for cigarettes.""I've heard this before, where have I heard this before?!""There was just a Radiolab episode about this. But instead of $2000 to Westboro Baptist, it was $5000 to the KKK. Coincidentally, the lady in the story quit too. She couldn't stand the thought of the KKK having her money."That is the best plan ever.They do go away. I quit 4 years ago and I haven't wanted a cigarette for the last 3."Cravings do go away for a lot of people. I haven't have a craving in a year and a half. Maybe a thought here and there, but never a craving. I've been quit two years now and my last real craving was at 4 or 5 months. But I work around it constantly as I work at a bar so I learned to resist cravings pretty quickly

Awesome way to quit though!!! Congrats and keep at it!""The cravings! Yes I haven't had a cigarette in over two years however the cravings still come.  It's very hard to resist for a split second and then it's gone.  I know if I had a smoke I would be instantly hooked again. I had a puff recently, loved it immensely. It felt like hugging an old friend. Was tempted strongly to go to the convenience store and buy a pack. 

They never go away but it gets hella easier to ignore them. It feels great being a non smoker!""I still get cravings 14 years later, well maybe not so much cravings, but whenever I see someone smoking, I think about how nice it would be to have one. I work with smokers, so this is almost a daily occurrence."This is honestly brilliant. I might recommend this to smoker friends.Did you get this idea from Radiolab? Such a sweet episode!"I've read about this tactic in the book, ""Change Anything"".  Good to know that it works in the real world.""Would be a great system if checks weren't only good for 90 days, but that's still more than enough time to kick the habit.""ok, but what if you had failed? or someone else tried the same thing and failed. I heard about an alarm clock app that would do the same thing if you don't get up. It just seems like a bad idea because a lot of people would end up helping fund these evil organizations. 
"Electronic cigarette and Swedish snus."> Swedish snus

This is far too low in the comments.

I quit this way.  I tried a billion other things. It's strong as fuck, and gives you something to do.  Nicotine gum and patches never worked, but I never had a problem giving up cigarettes for snus.  Eventually, I managed to quit snus.

But even if you can't quit snus, it's at least a healthier replacement.  Yes, American Cancer Society and others hold firm that ALL tobacco is equally bad, but they're wrong.  [Swedish Snus has been studied to death.](http://www.pmi.com/eng/our_products/snus/pages/health_effects_of_swedish_snus.aspx) and it's safer.  Harm reduction is good.

Edit: Just a pro tip in case anyone wants to do this, go for the Swedish brands if you can.  The American versions  (e.g. Camel) are of a lesser quality.

"read this as swedish anus."An upvote for Swedish snus.  I smoked a pack a day for around 10 years, bought a can of snus, and had my last cigarette the same day.  No headache, or aggravation, or anything.

I am, however, now addicted to snus.  It's definitely a case of addiction replacement for me.  It's a lot cheaper, though, and certainly much less harmful.""Swedish snus did the trick for me too. I really like nicotine to be honest, and snus is more convenient, better tasting, and less obtrusive to my life. It's the best of all worlds.""Snus was what made it possible for me to go without cigarettes. However it was harder to quit snus. Today I'm nicotine free, mostly thanks to a gradually decreasing my intake and ofcourse the will power."This worked for me as well."Donå«t use snus. Its even harder to quit. Been using snus for 5 years after quitting smoking. Im now on day 6 without snus, and its hell. ""Ctrl+F, snus

I had been a pack-a-day smoker for probably 4-5 years when a friend let me try his snus. The first time it tastes horrible, but very quickly you start enjoying it.

I almost ""accidentally"" quit smoking - while taking snus, my cigarette cravings were minimal and at one point I realised I might as well put in that extra bit of effort and quit smoking completely.

Happy to say I've been smoke free for 17 months.""Serious thread and all, but I could've swore you said Swedish anus"saw swedish sluts"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't quitting cigarettes for snus about the same as quitting them for chewing tobacco?""pretty sure snus is worse.
EDIT: might be thinking of dip""Switching to the E-Cig worked well for me as well as most of my friends.  
  
I decided to try them out when they were still very new. There wasn't a whole lot of variety at the time and the first type I tried didn't satisfy, so I went back to tobacco. But as E-Cigs grew in popularity, better products came out and were largely more satisfying than cigarettes.  
  
I don't know if you could classify this is 100% quitting, but it is definitely a better alternative. A majority of my friends have stepped down their nicotine levels and are at 0mg.  
  
The only thing left to beat is the hand-to-mouth routine. And I think that is the hardest part. "it worked for me too! I actually feel so much better."This. After 20 years, nothing else worked. Went from 24mg to 6mg now going to 3mg then 0mg! Didn't pick up an analog after the first day with a decent PV and good e-liquid! check /r/ecr if you're curious."Gonna have to go through a lot of regressive therapy to get over that oral fixation! Why bother?"A GOOD quality ecigarette/personal vaporiser. Variable wattage, quality clearomiser & a wide variety of juices. ""The good part is very important. Of people I know who started vaping, all but one who got a decent setup is off cigarettes now. I don't know anyone who successfully quit by sticking to those disposable gas station cigalikes. I used one after I decided to make the switch but before my hardware arrived, and it saved me from buying one last pack, but I never would have stuck with those things. ""This (a good personal vaporiser) coupled with the news that my fiance is 7 weeks pregnant was all the incentive I needed.  We found out on the 10th and I haven't had a real cigarette since (34 year old here that hasn't gone that long without a cigarette since I started at age 13.)

I don't think having a child is absolutely required, but a similar kick in the ass may help :)"[deleted][deleted]Brushing my teeth a lot. Made me taste the yuck. Naturally i grew uncomfortable with it."I've never heard of this before, it's clever.""My dentist convincing me I needed to brush my teeth after every time I smoked really helped me too.

After shelling out a couple hundred bucks to have them cleaned, I wasn't going to skip it, and eventually, associating a quick smoke at work with having to run to the bathroom to brush my teeth with a travel toothbrush made it not worth the hassle.

This is slowly happening with me and coffee as well. ""I did something similar. I wanted to quit smoking so I over smoked. I smoked until I didn't want to look at an other cigarette. Instead of smoking when I felt like it, I smoked all the time. I took me two months of chain smoking to quit. Haven't smoked for over a year. 

It's all about associating the smoke with yuck. "[deleted]I like brushing before a cig. Makes the smoke all minty :) will not help me quit. Neither does chewing gum all day. Just makes the cigs taste better.">Naturally i grew ~~un~~comfortable with it.

Naturally that's what would actually happen.""For me the most important thing was to understand that smoking a cigarette does not help with any problem I have, nor does it make any moment any more special than it already is. 

For example, if I'm stressed the smoker-me wanted to have a smoke and thought that it is more difficult to deal with stress after having a smoke. The non-smoking-me understands that the only way to deal with stress is to find the real cause for it and do something about that reason. Smokers tend to give cigarettes more value than they actually have. Mostly it is the ritual, the smoking break, having something to do with your hands, going outside for 5 mins that helps, not the ciggie. 

Also, I ate a tiny bit of nicotine gum blended with normal sugar free gum for the worst moments. I ate in total about 20 pieces. 

I had some cravings for salt liquorice at the time, maybe the taste is a bit similar? For me it helped. ""> For me the most important thing was to understand that smoking a cigarette does not help with any problem I have, nor does it make any moment any more special than it already is.

Exactly this! Getting through the first week was quite difficult, but with ideas like this in mind, it made it a lot easier."Actually nicotine is a pretty great drug and likely did help with problems you had. At the very least you forced yourself to take a break and focus on your breath for a few minutes. That alone does wonders for your stress level."Vaporizer (ecig, 0mg) and eventually I just stopped that too.

Willpower assumes that it's something you *want* to do, but you're willing yourself not to. Once I decided I didn't *want* to be a smoker, it just became about how to quit instead of why.

Although, she doesn't mind the occasional cigar.""This might disagree with a lot of Redditors but I don't think that's a very cool thing to do. You don't mandate things out of your partner or force change on them. I don't care if it's devil smoking, you just don't do that. Live with the person they are or leave them."Me ex boyfriend tried to get me to quit. It didn't work too well."Henpicked much?

Seriously though, how would she react if you had told her she was quitting smoking?

Because the answer to that tells a lot about a relationship.""Vaping made me quit cigs,  worked well 

Is vaping still considered smoking?"Only by those who don't know the difference.Vaping only gets you the nicotine. It's no more smoking than using nicotine gum or patches is.[deleted]Vaping./r/electronic_cigarette"Can't recommend them enough. Been without an analog for two months, and I'm down to juices with 6mg nicotine (started with 18mg) or less. Making the complete switch to 0mg when I'm done with these bottles of 6. 

A couple brick & mortar vape stores opened in my area, and literally every time I've been there, someone age 50+ comes in and asks for help to quit smoking. They always get set up with a nice starter kit and some of the more realistic tobacco flavors. Having a place to go and ask questions and test flavors and get recommendations is obviously very helpful. 

I would include that ecigs aren't always helpful for quitting. Being able to get your nicotine anytime and anywhere can actually worsen a nicotine addiction. You still have to have the desire to stop nicotine intake altogether, or you'll be back on the analogs as soon as you find yourself without a battery or running out of liquids. 

I've had this idea that someone should develop an ecig specifically designed to limit the time and number of inhales and decrease them over a period of a couple weeks. Shouldn't be too difficult to program it, especially now that there are ecigs like the eVic. ""My Dad smoked for 35+ years and finally last year picked up an e-cig, hasn't had a real one since. And this is a man who used to smoke 2 packs a day of Benson & Hedges 100's, and rip off the filters. 

My boyfriend bought them for his parents who were also heavy smokers for christmas. We weren't sure how it was gonna go, but turns out to be working really well for them and they haven't had real cigs now for over a month. Seems to work really well for long time smokers.""This. In a year I've been able to transition from 20 cigarettes a day, to vaping with nicotine, eventually to vaping without any nicotine, and now I'm slowly quitting even that.""These actually just make me wanna smoke the real thing. :( 

"[deleted]Disclaimer- nicotine is still harmful."I read Allen Carrs book about quitting. The argument that did it for me, was that smoking doesn't really make you feel better, it just makes you feel worse when you're not smoking, and then when you smoke you get to feel as good as a non-smoker feels *all the time*.""This is a great realization! And when people say it calms you down, it really doesn't! It actually makes you more jittery, you just feel ""soothed"" and distracted because your nicotine addiction is being taken care of! And even after two weeks you feel so much better! My favorite part was food! You can taste things better as a non smoker! :D"e-cig. almost all my friends who used to smoke switched to e-cigs and eventually quit altogether I found an electronic cigarette that delivered a sufficiently enjoyable experience. It really worked for me."Vaporizers. Hands down. My whole family decided to switch to them as well which helped a lot. Tried quitting before only to start back up because everyone else in the house smoked. Once we all quit, it was easier than anything else ive done. It was basically a social stigma that made me smoke. ""Same here! I vape and started smoking less and less cigs. I have a full pack sitting in my car, and often want one - but they taste so awful at this point that I think I'm done for good. "Warm Turkey"So how's that work? You light yourself on fire instead of the cigarette?

I guess that's technically quitting..."dooooood this is not thanksgivingwhat?Running. I guess any aerobic exercising would do that.This right here. Had been trying to quite for quite a while and finally started running after two days without cigarettes. I'm now a month out without smoking and only crave more running."This **really** needs to be higher up. Sure, E-Cigs may be an easy alternative, but the best alternatives are rarely the easy ones. That's why they're worth it.""Yep, this... and exercise in general. I have a highly addictive personality, so I just replaced cigarettes with running and lifting. Once I built myself up to performing cardio of any significant volume, the thought of sparing any more of my lung capacity to smoke and tar made me ill. 

Now I'm far more addicted to picking up and putting down heavy shit than I ever was to cigarettes."Vapors"Chantix and a personal commitment.  Have to do it for you, not for someone else.""Chantix with no serious commitment for me, other than taking the pill twice a day. Over time I simply didn't need to smoke any more, quit and never looked back."[deleted]"My wife got pregnant, so after smoking for 20 years I tried Chantix. For me it was a miracle. After a week the cigarettes started to taste gross. By two weeks I noticed the cigarette butts in my ashtrays were getting longer, so I was smoking less and less of each cigarette. By three and a half weeks I was about to go out and smoke, then decided not to. That was almost 2 years ago. I still think about smoking. When I'm out drinking at the bars and all my friends go out for a smoke, I miss it a little. But my asthma is non existent now. I only need the inhalers, which I have used constantly since about 20 years old, maybe twice a month. Also I promised myself that if I live until 70, I can start up again(assuming they are still legal)."Chantix worked for me.Didn't Chantix cause like hundreds of suicide attempts or something?"I took Chantix, and it totally worked for me. Smoke free for over a year! now, I only took it for about 3 weeks (instead of 12) because the side effects were gnarly (couldn't sleep, if I could, I had horribly violent dreams). but I really *wanted* to quit - Chantix just gave me the extra push because it made smoking disgusting. ""I tried and failed a couple times with Chantix. I still had to actively choose not to somke often. When drinking this would be very difficult sometimes. This last time, I don't know what was different, but I don't think about smoking ever. I didn't have dreams about smoking, and I don't crave them ever. It's great. I'm at 2 years and 2 months without one.

For me the side effects of Chantix were good. My dreams became really vivid and just awesome. I loved the side effects. 

I highly recommend it. I realize it's not the solution for everybody, but it worked great for me. ""I've been on chantix for 6 years now.  It's supposed to be a couple of month thing but I take one pill every other day or so and I don't even think about cigarettes.  I've talked to my doctor (obv) and he is ok with it.

Side note:  Chantix seems to alleviate my symptoms of addiction and I believe it has been very helpful in me staying sober for the last 6 years.

Side note 2:  I do get some weird full color dreams from time to time, so there's that.""All the horror stories of Chantix aside; that stuff worked great when I was trying to quit.  I actually only took about a month worth of the actual pills and haven't looked back since; its been over 6 years now.

I will admit that I do still get cravings once in awhile; mostly in some social setting like having drinks etc. Haven't given in personally but I can definitely see how some people are strictly 'social smokers'.""I stopped by using Chantix as well (also, reading Alan Carr's book helped a lot).  The first time using Chantix, I was smoking again within a few months - and felt horrible and really ashamed about it.  A few months later I tried again an it worked for good.  Haven't smoked in almost seven years.

Sometimes willpower alone isn't enough.  It is a physical addiction as well as a mental one.""My Doctor looked at me and said, ""Have you ever vomited or had a nightmare?""

Me: ""Yes, I've done both of those things before, probably at different times""

Doctor: ""And did you call me after you had a nightmare or vomited?""

Me: ""Nope.""

Doctor: ""Then here, take Chantix. If you feel nauseous or have a nightmare, then you know you don't have to call me. You'll be fine""

Basically, the side effects of Chantix far outweigh the consequences of smoking. I haven't smoked in over a year. The fear surrounding Chantix is overblown. It's not that bad."My wife quit using Chantix. She also wanted to quit because she was worried about second hand smoke and SIDS with our baby. She is going on 3 years now."I did it with a combination of Chantix and Wellbutrin. The Chantix gave me really crazy dreams and would make me nauseous unless I had a full meal when I took it. I think taking the Wellbutrin did help with that afterward, but I haven't had a cig since 2006, so it worked.""Ex-pharmacy tech here. It seems like when chantix is tolerated, it works really, really well. I think the longest I ever saw someone on it was 3 or 4 months. None relapsed as far as I heard. That said, it seems many people can't tolerate it. I usually suggested to those people to try ecigs. Ecigs cut out all the crap of a real cig and you can ease your nicotine levels down while still satisfying the physical addiction of holding that cancer stick. They also have a better cessation rate than patches or gum. Plus they have cool flavors you can play with. I have friends who had no intention to quit who got into ecigs because of that stuff.""Seriously, Chantix is a miracle drug. After taking it for a week, quitting smoking was actually really easy. I only had one day of physical withdrawal symptoms. I took it for a month and have been a nonsmoker for 6 years now. I'm betting the tobacco industry is very thankful for all of the bad publicity this drug got.""Chantix did it for me too.  Everyone on this thread who quit cold turkey definitely has my respect, but I tried that and just about everything else and just couldn't stop without eventually starting up again.  Chantix basically ruined cigarettes for me for good, which is just what I needed.  it has been a year since I stopped taking it and to this day the idea of smoking a cigarette makes me cringe.  A lot of people have mentioned the side effects...I didn't experience any of that and know that every person is different.  As with any prescription drug you should be careful and closely monitor your physical/mental/emotional state for any changes while you are taking it.  That said, for me Chantix worked wonders and there was no down side at all.""Chantix worked for me.  I picked it up on a recommendation from a pharmacist with no real commitment to quit.  7 days later my desire to smoke was completely gone (and I had been a pack a day smoker for 15 years).  Side effects included vivid dreams (cool, but very disruptive to sleep), and intense road rage.  "Wellbutrin (Bupropion) for me. Prescribed for other reasons but suddenly I realized I didn't need nicotine anymore. After that it was simply a matter of not buying another pack to break the habit."Chantix is amazing. I had some CRAZY dreams, but I actually looked forward to sleeping at night. It was like going to the movies and never knowing what you were going to get. :)

I was reading some message boards / reviews of the drug, and one guy said ""it makes you forget what it was like to smoke"". I 100% agree with this. I see smokers now and it feels like I've never smoked at all. My brain doesn't even remember what it felt like to drag on a cigarette. 

The only issue I have now is sometimes I dream that I smoked a cigarette. The dreams are really vivid. It's kind of disturbing to wake up and think I didn't actually quit. ""Side effects are pretty bad, it's better to quit using another tool IMO.""I was successful on Chantix for a few months with the bizarre dreams, and started again when my wife started again (she used the patch).

I am currently 17 days smoke free on 1/2 dose of Chantix and regular chewing gum for the oral fixation. The 1/2 dose stops the cravings and does not produce the side effects like the full dose did for me.""I'm a biomedical science grad student and grew up hanging out/working in pharmacies. Chantix is awesome on a whole. I sold a ton of it. Now, it gives some people side effects and, for some people, it doesn't work at all. However, it will likely work for the average smoker and it works great. It can really help. If somebody is having real problems quitting and hasn't tried chantix, I would highly recommend asking their doctor for it and be aware of the side effects. ""Worked for me as well. Worst side effect for me was the lucid dreams, and i cant claim them to be a negative.""I'm on week 3 of Chantix right now. The dreams are sooo fucking intense. They aren't bad, just intense. I would take pills just for the dreams""Chantix did the trick for me, too, however I was unable to complete the full 3 month course of medication due to the side effects. 

About 5 weeks in, I started becoming uncharacteristically angry and aggressive. After narrowly avoiding a bar fight (which I started) and kicking the shit out of my kitchen trash can for some reason or another, I decided it would be wise to stop taking the stuff.

I do miss the dreams, though."My stepson smoked all his life.  Then Chantix.  Never smoked again.  Amazing.Me too 4.5 years and counting after 30 years of smoking and wanting to quit for 20 of them."Chantix is the closest thing to magic I've ever experienced. I started taking it, and like 4 hours past my smoke time I was like ""wait...I should have wanted to smoke by now""

beware the side effects. They're all true""I can't fucking believe I had to scroll down this far to find other Chantix quitters.  It'll be 6 months for me in a little over a week, about 4 of which has been off the Chantix.  I don't even have cravings anymore, it's great.""Surprised I had to scroll down so far for Chantix. 

Worked for me, pill did all the work! Thank you drug company! ""After 20 years of smoking, Chantix worked wonders for me. Plus it gave me crazy ass dreams which was kinda fun. ""My Dad was one of the early users of Chantix, and was able to quit after 52 years. He wrote them a letter to thank them, and they ended up sending a film crew down and made him their spokesman for about a year. Look up Chantix Herb, and that's my old man. I haven't tried it myself, but that shit works. ""For me, it was the fact that I paid for Chantix and couldn't use it. I got through the first week fine, but when I got to the ""full dose"" strength, I would feel nauseated within minutes after taking it, and feel absolutely awful for hours on end.  

But, I had already paid the $200 or whatever it was then, so I just forced myself to keep on with the quitting process, because I wasn't willing to throw away $200 like that.  Which is ironic, because I blew $200  every 3-4 months smoking about 2/3 pack a day.  ""This. I tried patches, gum, cold turkey, etc. All several times. Once on Chantix and I haven't smoked in 4 months. The longest stint before that was 3 weeks during my 25 year pack-a-day habit."Chantix worked great for me. I miss the cool dreams. No suicide attempt here."Chantix for six months worked for me. 35 years smoking those damn things, quitting several times along the way. Been three years, never again. Besides a few strange dreams, no side effects for me.""Yep. Champix in Canada. Had awesomely vivid dreams and I got a bit short tempered but it was the EASIEST way for me to quit. And I tried everything. Cold turkey, patches, gum, inhaler, lozenge, Allan Carr, Wellbutrin and finally quit on Champix.
It was so easy. I just started barely smoking and then threw out the remainder of the pack.
Unfortunately, two years later I caved and had a drag after being badgered by co-workers who'd forgot I quit. Now I'm on ADD meds and can't take it. Looks like I'll have to do patches and then cold turkey while in Cuba. I loathe American smokes and I found I don't have cravings if they're all that's available.
Convincing myself that I can NEVER have even a drag is the hard part.""Chantix was a miracle drug for me. I had some of the most vivid dreams that were so real they were scary, but other than that I had no side effects. I have zero urges to smoke and it's been almost two years. It worked so well I scares me to think of what it did to my brain. ""Chantix made me angrier than I've ever been, constantly.   I tried it for a few weeks and I just couldn't continue with it.  ""Wellbutrin did it for me.  Three weeks of pills,  and 14 years later,still no cravings.  ""Pretty much the same for me. I decided I was tired of going to the doc every month coughing up blood. I took Chantix for three weeks and by the end of the first week I wasn't smoking a single one. By the end of the second week, I didn't even enjoy the smell of a nearby cigarette. After three weeks I just stopped taking the pills and moved on with my life. I still have cravings from time to time (Quit 5.5 years ago.) especially if I have a few beers, but I just have to remind myself that it isn't worth it.""Same, Chantix.  After several failures using a variety of other methods (including cold turkey), it was surprisingly easy to quit with Chantix.  I also never took a pill right before bed so I pretty much missed out on the intense dreams.  ""I took Welbutrin. I kept smoking for the first week, and I kid you not after that week, cigarettes tasted disgusting and every time I smoked one I didn't know why I was doing it. (My brain wasn't getting the nicotine so I was smoking without the pleasurable feeling I was used to.) 

Now a days I can be around people that smoke, or even smoke a cigarette myself but I still don't get that same feeling that kept me smoking for so many years."I tried Chantix and it destroyed my will to live."I tried Chantix, but then dreamt of eating a dead baby fetus.....decided cold turkey was the way to go.""Chantix is the only thing that worked for me. It took awhile, a few attempts while on and off of it.. but it worked. getting off the chantix is it's own weirdness, but not hard just weird. It's difficult to describe in vivid details, but with Chantix I slept awesome, had great dreams, and felt generally swell. but when I quit, my sleep got more restless (waking up occasionally, having a little bit more trouble falling asleep), and sometimes when waking I would a bit off, like something was wrong. That abated after a few months though. 

One strange thing I experienced when I first stopped smoking cigarettes on Chantix (though I don't think it is relevant to this).. I felt like I need a ""boost"" every now and then. Cigarettes are a stimulant, though it doesn't feel like it. I would seek just something that would get my heart going for a second or something. Exercise helped. ""Another Chantix vote here. Both my wife and I quit with it. Me before meeting her, so separately. 

I took it before the suicide issues were known. But I had no problems with it. "I would never try chantix after seeing the commercials with 50+ serious side effects. It's fucking ridiculous   "Chantix was very evil for me. Fuck Chantix. 

Edit: sorry if this opinion bothered anyone but Chantix made me extremely nauseous,  I had insomnia,  when I did sleep I had fucked nightmares.  I was miserable on Chantix.  I'm sure it works for some people,  but I've heard nothing but bad about it.  ""I can't speak for myself, so I'll tell my dad's story. He smoked for most of his life, and had a heart attack. The doctor's advised him to quit, and he tried, he really did. Patches didn't work. Gum didn't work. So he always went back to smoking.

Until he needed a heart bypass operation. He had a meeting with the surgeon who told him ""if you don't stop smoking completely in 3 months time I will not do the operation. If you don't have this operation you will not live to see your son grow up. You probably won't see Christmas.""

Worked a treat for him. As I recall, research suggests that gum, patches, etc. all feed the craving, and the most successful quitters were those who went cold turkey. I could probably find a source for that if necessary.""I have ""quit"" before using cold turkey and while I was able to go smoke free for about 3 weeks I ended up caving to the patterns in my head.

For me I always ""caved"" because I was so use to using the cigarette as a way to take a 5 minute break from whatever pissed me off.  When I finally quit for good I had to use the patch.  I followed there system and it worked.

Basically it let me focus on the habit and not the addiction.  Once the habit part was dealt with the going from 12mg/24 hours -> none was very easy. (I think its 12mg for the last step, I can't recall).  
""That sorta thing might work for some, and it is a good thing that it worked for your dad.

I honestly could see myself either finding another surgeon or go so mad that I just wouldn't have the operation.""I am aiming for zero nicotine but if I ever go back to it after that, it will only ever be to ecigs. That is rarely the case with patches/gum, so you will need to wait for proper research before you can update your mental module accurately on this one.

Different things work for different people but nicotine is about as harmful as caffeine for most (not such a good idea long-term for people with heart, kidney or liver disease, or diabetes). If you're going to worry about nicotine addiction you really need to worry about caffeine too and as for alcohol, it's off the scale of harm compared.

ecigs break the MAOI addiction that you get with tobacco, and they provide an enjoyable alternative to smoking. If you don't get why smokers smoke then you won't get it anyway. But ecigs could wipe out tobacco altogether in a generation, and we should want that to happen. Hypothetical fears based on different sources of nicotine which smokers do not enjoy taking aren't a counter-argument.""Glad that worked for him. Didn't work for my Dad, he just started smoking again after the bypass.""I had to quit both coffee, and my 2-3 beer a day habit when I was exposed to some toxic chemicals at work. Eventually, the BP dropped, but the insane craving for those few beers drove me nuts. There was an AA group close by, free coffee, which I shouldn't have been drinking much of, and people whose life sucked much worse than mine when they had to quit. 

I suppose it was like that Fight Club thing. Think your life sucks? Check out these people! Thing was, I used to drink a whole whole hell of a lot more. That step from 9-12 beers a day to 2 or 3 was a hell of a lot easier that going to totally nothing, even if I got sick when I drank just one beer. Ug! 

Anyway, better now, sort of. ;) Took the liver about 6-7 months to fix itself, a very grueling period of sobriety and hating life. So now I can drink 2-3 beers, or 5-6 without my liver melting, but usually don't drink much more than a 12 pack a week. Guess I'm still addicted, but not badly. :D  "[deleted]I quit in 2008 after smoking for 23 years. What did it for me was a huge price increase. Like $1.00 a pack. I got so **pissed off** that I was paying *so much money* to essentially kill myself that I was able to quit cold turkey. Quit in 2004. By then a pack in Sweden was 7 dollars.I quit in early 2003. The money I saved in the following 3 years enabled me to pursue a ÛÏlife goalÛ that I wouldn't otherwise have been able to afford to do.Are you my father?"Truthfully e-cigs I bought them to get a crafty nicotine fix in a non smoking workplace with no desire at all to give up smoking originally. 

I was very skeptical but I thought anything was worth a try to get me through so when my first 510 came in the mail I tried it out, what can I say except it worked and I pretty much gave up smoking right away and I still have an unopened packet.

Don't think I could go back to smoking again and it sickens me to see the campaigns against e-cigs now I think they have lengthened my life and it's downright evil to try and remove them from a society that still has tobacco.""> ... it sickens me to see the campaigns against e-cigs ... it's downright evil to try and remove them from a society ...

I fully agree. When I feel a wave of anger coming over me, I just enjoy the delicious irony that e-cigs have put anti-smoking extremists in bed with Big Tobacco.
"I need an e-cig.throw the unopened packet away!"Alan Carr's easy way to quit smoking. Great book, read it once and have been quit for 4 years."[deleted]Easy way to stop smoking by Allan Carr. I quit twice using this book and so did all my friends. Highly recommend it to any smoker."It worked for my wife and I. I'm not sure how, but it took the stress out of it completely.""I quit smoking about 9 million times before I was successful - that makes me an expert, right? My personal research (focused on former smokers with at least a year of non-smoking under their belts) led me to the solid conclusion that **cold turkey is the method that almost all successful non-smokers use** (95% or so if I remember my stats correctly). Do your own research, define what you think of as success in those searches.

Here are some things that I went through to help me wrapped up as advice:

First, **get comfortable with the idea of being a non-smoker.** Spend some time imagining what it will be like to stop smoking. Daydream about it. Practice turning down cigarettes in your mind. Let it be what you think about in the shower and as you drift to sleep at night. If you meditate - meditate on breathing better, being able to run, having white teeth, being morally superior to your smoking friends, or whatever about being a non-smoker is attractive to you.

Then **commit to being a non-smoker**. Decide that you're going to become that daydream that you're having. That doesn't mean throwing down your pack and trying to see if your will or the drug is stronger. It means knowing balls to bones that this is what you're going to do.

During this time **start cutting out some places that you smoke**. For me I stopped smoking in my car. Then I stopped smoking inside while at home. Then I stopped smoking at work. This was all a process that I went through for months.

**Decide on a date.** Think of it as your new birthday. On your new birthday get rid of all your smoking stuff. Give it away, throw it away, burn it if that means something to you. that means lighters, ash Trays, cigarettes.

**Avoid places where you went to smoke.** That means changes in your life awhile. Plan 6 months or a year. Smoking areas are off limits to you just like bars are off limits to an alcoholic.

When you have those moments where you think you'll have to cave - pray if you're inclined, take a timeout, go to your car and scream for a minute, take a jog, code, eat celery, pick your nose - **do something, anything besides smoke.** The craving will pass. 

**Repeat the daydream in your head, often.** The withdrawal is only temporary. It's like having a bad case of the flu - It will suck, but you'll get over it.

Stay done. Realize that **you can't argue with addiction**. There is no reasonable amount of smoking. There isn't a peaceable middle ground between smoking and not. Stick to it. 

**If you slip up, so what?** Throw that pack away too. Go back to the daydream of being a non-smoker. One slip isn't failure - each time you've quit before has prepared you for this. Put your quitting shoes back on. 

**Look at the benefits of quitting.** Look them up, read about them, think about them, cherish them.

I doubt you'll get this given the thousands of responses, but maybe it will help someone.

Edit: words did and didn't happen."Quitting smoking is easy! I did it 20 times last year."I worked as smoking cessation counselor back in the day.  Some things to keep in mind.

* Most people attempt to quit 7-9 times before being successful (defined as at least 6 months without smoking.  Having failed at quitting several times is actually good--it means you're on the right track of working out when and how to quit.

* there's two aspects to smoking: behavioral and physical.  You can treat the physical with nicotine gum, patches, or gradually reducing your smoke intake before a quit day.  Behavioral also requires strategy--find some thing you can do when you want to smoke. Whenever and however you can change your habits is a big help.

* in the end, it all comes down to gutting it out. There are some tips and tricks that make it a little easier, but it's 99% guts. ""Am I right in saying that even if you're ingesting nicotine, say with gum or patches, for those 6 months, you're still considered ""successful""? I think that's the only reason ""studies"" show that nicotine replacements work."How would one find a smoking cessation counselor?"After reading Allen carrs book and quitting easily without having to try and fail again and use patches or other nicotine replacements, I think these methods are vastly inferior to his. Why make it hard on yourself. The physical part is almost non existent. Its all in our heads. ""Which is exactly why vaping is so successful, since it replaces the behavioral aspect while also providing the physical aspect.""It isn't just nicotine addiction that comes along with smoking, it's habits. Routines. I would have a cigarette before class, during breaks, and after class. I'd have a cigarette after a big meal, with my morning coffee, etc. Start breaking these habits. I would first stop smoking when I was going to/from class. Then gradually break more of these habits as you go along. I also started running to aid in the inevitable weight gain -- it's also gratifying when you can run for a half hour straight without dying from the lack of breath. I hope this helps! I honestly never thought I'd be able to quit and it's been over six months now. You can do it!""These kinds of actions helped me quit the last time. For me if was no more smoking in the car, and then no smoking until all of my work was done. This lead me to realize I viewed smoking as a reward. That's like rewarding yourself by having someone rub your face in asbestos.""This is exactly what I did. Some people aren't able to go this route, but I found that slowly cutting out each smoking habit helped me immensely. I started by not smoking in my car, then not smoking at lunch, and eventually progressed to only smoking 1 cigarette a day. Running helps too! It feels great to progress and be able to breathe while working out.""Also, MAOIs present in tobacco enhance nicotine addiction, too. So, that also comes with smoking."Did you ever end up gaining weight since you decided to run to combat it? This is one of the things I'm worried about. But I do love running!"I just passed my [1000th day without a cigarette](http://www.sigbanners.com/reddit/75.png). I couldn't have done it without vaping. Electronic cigarettes, when given enough power and enough nicotine (if it looks like a cigarette, it's probably too weak on both counts) give you a better 'smoke' than tobacco does, and actually smoking would be a step down on all counts.

*edit: linky""Complete change of environment and habits. I quit my job. I doing so I had the chance to change my entire daily schedule. With no habitual smoking breaks, I dropped it without a problem. It was really just the habit, not the addiction for me. "Ecig"I smoked for about 6 or 7 years and tried cold turkey or limiting myself to only smoking at home and not work. My sister in laws dad was a lifetime smoker and developed lung cancer at the age of 60 and slowly died within two months. She sent me a picture of him in the hospital a week after the diagnosis and that was enough for me. It wasn't the typical ""YOUR LUNGS WILL BE BLACK AND FALL APART IF YOU SMOKE"" bit rather a real world example that hit very close to home.  This was a man that I viewed as a strong leader and now he was barely over 100 pounds and couldn't even lift his head on his own.  I stopped cold turkey that night and haven't looked back. I have a brother who still smokes and at his rate he won't live to see 60, which means he only has 25 years left with us.  I would never want to force my views on anyone and understand that people can do what they want but I would strongly recommend that anyone reading this comment please stop smoking. If not for yourself than at least for your family and friends. ""We have 2 age 70+ guys in our office. One skiid, still goes to the gym and was active and never smoked his entire life. The other has been smoking since he was a teen. The non smoker is as active as a 50 year old.

Listening to the smoker cough up his lungs every 40 minutes is terrible. It is like my uncles last 5 days alive when he came to live with us (lung cancer). My headphones brely drown it out.

Were all gonna be old someday, which old person would u rather be? That and also waking up in the morning with headaches, scratchy throat, and black boogers made me stop"">black boogers

I know what I'm gonna name my band.""Honestly, the idea of dying younger doesn't bother me. It's the idea of having an awful quality of life, maybe having a leg amputated or a lung removed, for 15 years before I die that bothers me."One word E-cigWhen my desire to smoke a cigarette was less than driving out in the middle of a tropical storm to get another pack. Then I realized how much I didn't want a cigarette after the storm cleared. "I heard an interview with a medical researcher who had just released a paper claiming that if you stop smoking at 30 then your prospects of a long life are not significantly changed by the fact that you once smoked. I was 33 at the time and I realised that I had a chance to turn things around, and do it now before it was too late as I was already beyond the mark...

And then a few months later I met my wife to be who was totally anti-smoking. If I had smoked that day when we first met (yes, it was a real Hollywood like love at first sight moment!) she would not have paid me any attention. This removed any risk at all of me reverting to my smoking ways. Yes, I struggled with the want to smoke, but I had found something soooo much better, a woman that loved me and a prospect of a long life. Simples!""I just quit for the second time, and I'm excited to share my story!

Saturday will be the 3-week anniversary of the last time I had cigarette smoke in my lungs, I did it easily with e-cigs.

January 9, 2014 my wife picks me up at work as usual (we are currently sharing one car) and she begins to tell me about her day, including that she had filled the gas tank.  I quickly look around for my cigarettes because she usually picks them up for me when she fuels up.  She sees me looking around and asks ""Aren't you going to go get one of those e-cigs you were talking about?""

D'oh!  I had mentioned the idea of trying one in passing earlier in the week and didn't realize she would have taken the comment to heart.  Reluctantly, I gave in. ""Yeah, I guess...""

So we drive to Vaporz, the nearest vape shop in town.  I knew I wanted a PV (personal vaporizer) over a typical e-cig that you could buy at every convenience store in town, simply because of the success/failure rate of both that I have personally seen from friends, acquaintances, and co-workers that have tried quitting using an electronic substitute.

At the shop, I was greeted by an exuberant hipster-type guy who seemed way too chipper for the attempt at a major life change I was about to make.  After explaining my situation to him, he presented me with this starter kit:

http://i.imgur.com/4FW3izn.jpg

He then asked me how much I smoked.  Admittedly, it wasn't much comparatively to some people... about 1/3 pack a day.  He suggested medium-strength fluid (11mg Nicotine per ml) and asked what flavor I would like to go with my starter kit.

Determined to not set myself up for failure, I asked for the Marlboro flavored fluid.  

When I got home that evening, I had a smoke before I went inside then proceeded to examine my new gadgets.  I filled the tanks on the PVs as he had instructed, attached the batteries, and started puffing.  ""Not too bad."" I thought to myself, and continued to use it the remainder of the evening.

The next morning was the real test.  Major trigger for me is just getting out of bed in the morning.  Nicotine starved, running out to the porch the first thing in the morning to get my fix has been part of my daily ritual for over a decade.  Still determined not to fail, and subsequently losing my previous night's investment (about $50), I fired up the PV and started sucking on it like... well, like something that sucks a lot.  

I wasn't satisfied.

I still had about 5 cigs left in my pack of American Spirits, so I slid one out, stepped outside, and lit up. 

There it was, the *rush*.  The feeling you get when you light that first cig up in the morning, the rush to the head, the burn in the throat, the satisfaction that you and your body just *craves*.  

I butt it out and go inside to a disappointed wife.  I explain to her that there are different nicotine levels in the fluids they sell at the vape shop and that I wanted to return for stronger juice.  She agreed, more eager than I am for me to quit smoking and quit stinking like smoke, ash, and tobacco.  

The happy hipster is there again, and I explain my dilemma.  The nicotine level is too low.  Also the Marlboro flavor has that weird, sweet aftertaste which is what steered me to American Spirits in the first place.  After a short discussion about the strength of the cigs I smoke vs. the amount I smoke, I leave the shop with three new bottles of juice.  Two bottles of Camel tobacco flavor and one bottle of cinnamon, all in 24mg strength.  

At home I empty out and reload my PVs, one with Camel and the other with cinnamon.  I tried the cinnamon one first, it hit my throat like a truck.  It actually *felt* like smoking.  The Camel tasted more like the cigs I'm used to then the old juice did, and didn't have quite as harsh of a ""throat hit"".  

My solution? I mixed the two.  The end result tastes like Hot Tamale candy-flavored cig, which is great since I love cinnamon.  However, I knew the real test would be the next morning.

The next day, sitting at my computer, I fire up the PV (for the most part, it's odorless so my wife approves my use indoors).  The drags are satisfying but didn't quite get as much of that rush as I had hoped.  

Again, I slip out one of the remaining 4 cigs I have, step outside, and light up.  

I'm discouraged and disgusted at this point. I know I won't be able to keep it up. I know I'll regress into smoking full-time. I keep puffing on the cig, waiting to the rush I know will come.

It doesn't.

???

I realize as I'm standing on the porch, looking at my half-smoked cig, that I took my morning hits at my computer... *sitting down*.   Usually, my first smoke will make me dizzy, sometimes to the point of stumbling when I try to walk back inside.  Only after I sit for a bit and when my body is used to having the nicotine flowing around (usually just a minute or two) do I become stable again.  I know sitting with my PV greatly reduced that initial dizziness that I normally get when I'm standing on the porch.  I take my half-smoked cig and snuff it.

Wife is sitting inside, wondering if I wasted more money buying the stronger juice.  She is ecstatic as I grab the remaining 3 1/2 cigs I have and crush them into the garbage can.

I haven't smoked since, and I'm confident that I can vape without wanting to go back to cigarettes indefinitely.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I also want to add that since I've started vaping, I've done some research into the matter and here are some key points that I've learned.

1. Nicotine is *not* a carcinogen.  The 4000+ other chemicals in cigarette smoke is what causes lung cancer, not the nicotine. As a stimulant, nicotine in doses in the amount a regular PV delivers, is roughly the same risk as caffeine.

2. Secondhand vapor from a PV has 1/10 the nicotine levels of secondhand cigarette smoke, 1/7th the particulate matter, and negligible trace amounts of anything else.

3. Vapor dissipates much faster than smoke and is virtually odorless.  I noticed an improvement of my ability to smell and taste after about 3-4 days of vaping.

Additionally, I talked my dad into trying vaping.  I told him to go to a reputable brick-and-mortar (B&M) vape shop and talk to a salesperson so he can see and maybe even try different options.  I think it's better than trying to go it alone via mail-order.  He switched back and forth between cigs and vaping for a several days then quit cigs entirely.  He is about 1 1/2 weeks cigarette free as of today, from a 3 to 3 1/2 pack-a-day smoker.

Hopefully, my story can be helpful and inspiring to you or someone else who reads this. This is why I took the time to write it all out.

[Edit: I also wanted to add that I opted for the starter kit with 2 PVs because I knew if I had downtime waiting for a battery to charge I would be climbing the walls before it was ready to be used again]

**TL;DR:**  Not all e-cigs are created equal. A good vape shop and some common sense decision making can find a satisfying  alternative to smoking."Replying so I can find this again tomorrow."Willpower. I had yet another month where I had still some month left at the end of my money and I said to myself: That's it. I quit. I'm so done with this shit. Never touched a cig again, now 2 months off them."Having a heart attack at age 28. I had two packs on me and gave them to the EMTs. It helped to have a week off of work too. I couldn't function for a few days with the withdrawal."How did you know you were having one? What brought it on?

I'd imagine you would need to be either predisposed or lead a very inactive lifestyle to bring that on, but it is good you quit.""I started smoking at age 13 and stopped smoking at age 42.  I am 46 years old and haven't had one in 4 years.  I got to a point where I knew in my mind that smoking was going to one day kill me quicker then I wanted to die.  You gotta just want to quit, period.  It really is mind over matter and once you get over that hump there's no going back.  

Stop trying to quit if you really don't want to quit.  If you DO want to quit, stop being a pussy and do it and I mean that in a good way."Getting pregnant! This obviously is also an expensive habit though. I quit cold turkey after smoking for 12 years and never touched them again!"Preach! 4 years ago I quit. I still crave on occasion now, but getting hooked again isn't worth buying a whole pack. Besides long life to be around my kid is worth it.

And while I was pregnant, I couldn't stand the smell or sight."Chantix is amazing and effective. "Cold Turkey. I just remember standing outside thinking ""God, this hurts. My lungs literally hurt right now. "" and put it out. Never looked back. I didn't go out for awhile; Almost all of my friends smoked at the time. I just shut myself in for like a month and felt exponentially better every day. Now, even second hand smoke gives me an asthma attack :(""I started a streak of days not smoking and held it in such high regard that I couldn't imagine going back to 0. My buddy read a book, The Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Alan Carr. He quit and buys about $100 of the book every year to give out to anyone who mentions to him theyre trying to quit. My buddy is a good dude.
 ""Eventually, you're going to find that the most effective way to quit is to just stop.

I never tried or bothered to pick a date for my quit. Part of me knew that I had to stop soon before any of the major health effects started taking place. (I was already getting bronchitis virtually every time I'd catch a cold; so that was kind of a warning sign...) Then one morning, I woke up and said to myself, ""Fuck it. Today is just as a good a day as any."" I suppose that helped with any kind of anticipation towards a quit date. Some people like to try to reduce first. Frankly, I think that just starts the pain early before it even takes full force. Here. Let me just stab you in the legs a little bit before I cut them off with this rusty saw. I've always had something of an all or nothing mentality. If you're going to quit, don't bullshit yourself. Just stop. To anyone who is/was one to two pack a day smoker, you know well this concept seems easier said than done. Dig deep.

I think the worse part of quitting was the concept of quitting more-so than just the cravings themselves. Before, my mind would calm down a bit knowing ""Hey. Just an hour or two and then you can get a smoke in to relax a bit."" The realization would set in: ""You're never going to be able to smoke again."" At that moment, my mind would start to freak out. After a few weeks of this, I was beginning to wonder if I was going to end up living out the rest of my life in a constant frustrated agony of good and bad days. Shouldn't this have subsided by now? The cravings don't feel like they've become lesser or weaker at all. Nothing has fuckign changed! How is this better?! All I think about is when next time I'll ever be able to grab a fucking smoke again. If this was my fucking option, maybe I was just better off smoking. Whoever said that the withdrawal only lasts three days needs to be beaten into a bloody pulp.

Those first three weeks were probably the shittiest three weeks of my life; going through chemical and psychological withdrawals. For me, I felt high as hell those first two days. It wasn't a good high either. I'm guessing that was my body relearning how to release glucose on its own again without help. Stinger energy gels became a staple in my diet. I would have made Wilford Brimley cry. After that, it became the psychological craving battle. Frankly, it was hard to distinguish between chemical cravings and psychological ones. The chemical ones were more intense, but the psychological ones were more frequent. Any kind of stimulant only made the cravings more intense. Monster energy drinks became a big no-no. I'm on Concerta for ADHD, and HOLY FUCK did those ever multiply the cravings. Looking back now, I probably should have taken a vacation from those as well. They likely made my withdrawal substantially worse than what most people will ever experience. (If you're on Concerta or Ritalin and you smoke, you probably have some idea of what I'm talking about. Methylphenidate can [usually does] turbocharge any addictive tendencies you may have.)

You want to know when you realize you actually are an addict? When you're trying to quit and you see half of a lit cigarette on the ground that someone tossed away in the street, and picking it up for a few hauls seems like a decent and reasonable idea. It's odd too because you never really feel the moment when you're free. It could take a few days; realistically a few weeks; or possibly a few months. Everyone has a different clock. Then magically, one day you're going to wake up and realize ""Wow... I haven't had a nicotine craving in over a week."" This eventually becomes, ""I don't remember the last time I had a craving."" For a while, the only thing memorable was the infuriating madness of craving just one more burn. Hell, just a drag. One drag won't hurt, right? Yea. Lets fuck up three weeks of torture and start all over again. Seems like a fan-fucking-tastic idea.

Freedom is a great thing. It's not a quick thing, but it does eventually come. That was always my biggest fear. You begin to notice that you're capable of feeling lucid and focused without getting a quick burn in to help you out before hand. Think of it like getting better from being sick. There's no sudden ""AH HA!"" moment. It's a progression. Think back to when you were at your most miserable from something like a hangover or food poisoning. Now think about how you feel at this very moment. When you're feeling that awful, you want nothing more than to just feel NOT miserable. If you're not feeling sick and awful right now, you've won. You've achieved what you wanted some time ago. Take a moment to cherish that feeling. The concept is the same, only now you're directly responsible for the outcome. It's funny too, because victory requires the absence of doing anything.

I've always considered it a decent test of willpower and character. After almost two years, I still look back feeling like I conquered Everest.
""I, I'm so grateful you took the time to type this out. I'm so blown away how incredibly open total strangers can be. This was such a true and inspiring response, and I sincerely thank you for sharing.  I'm proud of your accomplishment and I wish you further success! I'm 18 days cigarette free with only a few cheats. (Which actually weren't even that great, honestly.) Thank you again so, so much for your kindness in sharing such wisdom.  ª´""That was incredibly generous and helpful advice. One of the best on here. I am on day 3 and so far so good, but it's great to hear someone describe the full journey. Thanks.""you need to get a good electronic cigarette, get help from /r/electronic_cigarette . I thought e-cigs didn't work for me too until I visited the subreddit and realized my biggest problem was being too cheap about it. You'll never switch fully to e-cigs with those crappy chinese cigarettes. I've quit lots of times, nicotine patches and toothpicks worked for me for a while but this switch has been the easiest time ""quitting"" ever. I am a pack a day smoker, I spent 2/3 of my 2 week smoking budget on a good e-cig (itaste ep) and found a good juice mix and now I've never been happier.

spending 50 bucks on that setup and I haven't bought a thing for over a month now. Hardest part was breaking my brain of expecting it's normal nicotine delivery system. It also helped that i got a mix with an odor, learned the sensation of smelling something with the puff helped. (I have the light odor of blueberries whenever I take an e-cig puff.). You gotta want to reprogram yourself to not smoke. the first few days will break you when you realize how much better you feel on e-cigs and how much more time you have with e-cig taking 1/4 the time to get you the same amount of nicotine as a single smoke.

4 weeks later. Haven't touched a single cigarette. Loving my mint blueberry-pomegranate e-juice and feeling a bit better every day. I can smell and taste everything and it's all the benefits of quitting without the anger or self loathing.

Seriously, check out /r/electronic_cigarette before dismissing e-cigs entirely. I'm a month in and I don't even have the inkling to go back to smoking. It's great!""I quit smoking cigarettes by smoking pot whenever I craved a smoke. I would get stoned and then want a cig, but I stuck to the technique. It took a couple weeks, but it worked like a charm. It didn't take long before I was just tired of being high all the time. That was 10 years ago, and while I've slipped a few times, I've never smoked more than one here or there. I still occasionally get cravings but they pass pretty quickly - mostly because I'm out of the habit of smoking. Like you said, being in the health care industry, your breaks only happen if you smoke. It's the same in the food service industry. It was a habit I developed and I had to get out of the habit of taking smoke breaks. ""Finally! I was wondering how long it would take to find this answer. I thought I was a freak! 

OK, I am kinda freakish, but I'm not alone!""So let's say you wanted to smoke a cigarette while stoned, you'd just take more puffs?

That sounds crazy harsh. That would have been legitimately painful for me to tolerate, I think.""Goes from smoking a filtered product that doesn't inebriate you to effectively an unfiltered one that does.  

Seems legit. "Me and my wife quit at the same time and nobody wanted to be the one to start back first. "I smoked a pack a day for 5 years. I quit by using Welbutrin. It made the effects of smoking negligible to me. I'd smoke but I didn't get a rush. Nothing at all. I went through withdrawals. I freaked out at work, yelling at a coworker. I was almost sent home for the day. I remember the withdrawals peaking on the third night. I was in a fetal position screaming into the carpet in my living room. Once I hit that hurdle, I kept on with the Welbutrin, but only for a couple weeks because I was warned that Welbutrin itself is addictive. Note that many people will tell you that Welbutrin is a bad drug, but I think they may be confusing its side effects with nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Also, Welbutrin gets a lot of bad press from people who are using it to treat their mental illness, and I don't trust their feedback. So yeah, welbutrin did it for me.


Something to note is that once you do quit, you'll still want to smoke. Like all the time, at first. But if you can sit back and observe the addiction - the urge - for what it is and not act on it, you'll do fine. Next, note that you'll need to readjust your life. Like what do you do right after a meal now that you quit? What do you do when you're just standing around outdoors? (We had no smartphones when I quit) What I'm getting at is that you'll feel oddly uncomfortable with cigarette's absence, but you'll adjust.


One last point. Not smoking makes you more attractive. Also, my wife tells me that when I smoked, I smelled not just like smoke, which is gross unto itself, but I also smelled like shit. I can confirm that smokers actually do smell like smoke and shit. And you don't wanna be the person in the room that smells like smoke and shit.


Good luck to everyone! Fucking win. Don't let that drug ruin you health and life. ""I went on Wellbutrin for anxiety and depression.  I didn't plan on quitting smoking but it happened right away.  I just didn't want to even think about cigarettes.   It's been 8 complete months, not one cigarette.  Now to fix ten years of smokey lungs.  "This was the only way I could quit.  Very effective."Holy shit. I'm taking Welbutrin for other reasons and I had no idea it helped people quit smoking. It's made me nauseous as hell but if it's the reason I haven't craved a cigarette in 2 months, then I'll take the trade off.""I can't take Wellbutrin, it makes me extremely depressed when it wears off which is the exact opposite of it's purpose.""Little known fact- tobacco products contain beta-carbolines which are MAOIs (anti-depressants). I hypothesize that some smokers, myself included, have a harder time withdrawing from the MAOIs than the nicotine.""(must be in a car) Buy a pack of smokes, light up a cig, when youre feeling terrible about how badly its killing you throw the pack out the window.  hour goes by, drive to the gas station buy another pack, light the cig, feel bad, throw pack out window. Hour goes by, you're down 11-12 dollars for two cigs. If you want go buy another pack and, repeat the steps until you're either A. broke  B. Tired of wasting money.

This is how I quit and it works.

The little fuckers work.Could you elaborate? I quit smoking by using the patch 9 years ago.  What was really successful though was just simply getting mad at the cigarettes for controlling my life.  I couldn't stand having to take breaks anymore to feed my stupid habit that was costing me thousands a year. [deleted]The cravings go away. DON'T QUIT BEFORE THE MIRACLE!"1) just quit - don't make a big deal out of it - just do it. i did it by chance.

2) do not count how long you are off the hook. as long as you keep in mind how long you are off, smoking has a too great value for you.

3) the most important one: if you think 'fuck it - i'll smoke one' (and believe me - this moment will come for sure) be aware of yourself and ask yourself - do i really want this? yeah, sure, i'm stressed. but then ask yourself once again - do i REALLY want this?
for me everytime the answer was no. it was really hard the first time, but it became much easier over the time."I agree with everything except #2. I agree with you long term because you'll stop thinking about it after a while anyways.   Keeping track of how long I had quit worked wonders for the first 6 months. To me it felt a lot like tracking lifting gains. "I got the flu, and proceeded to chain smoke until I violently threw up. I can remember that taste 12 years later. I was up to a pack a day after 10 years, and I almost went completely cold turkey after puking.""Quitting cigarettes is easy. Just start smoking cigars instead.

I didn't say it was perfect."There us an awesome community over at /r/cigars. You should go check it out."i tried to quit using the patch, gum, and e-cig. when you do that you are still chemically dependent and pretty much just substituting one habit for another. might as well switch to dip. when you're ready to quit you will. do it cold turkey. i think after 72 hours the nicotine is out of your blood stream and you are no longer chemically dependent and from this point on you are just trying to break habits (after you eat, when you get out of the car, when you get in your car, when you get off of work, etc). you will be amazed how fast your sense of smell and taste comes back. have some of your favorite foods on hand to experience them without the ash tray flavoring. you'll be surprised. do not reward yourself with a cig. for example if you go 24 hours without a cig then don't reward yourself with a cig. if you do that the past 24 hours of suffering were a total waste and you have reintroduced the chemicals into your bloodstream. just constantly remind yourself that i have suffered for this long without a cig and if i smoke one now all that hard work and suffering is for nothing. have lots of treats ready like sunflower seeds and hard candy. i was big on jolly ranchers and ring pops. jan15, 2013 was one year of no smoking for me and i can't tell you how proud of myself i am. good luck!!!    ""I quit cold turkey but here is how I did it. First I bought a new pack of smokes. I sat and chain smoked the whole pack in one sitting. The whole time I told myself how fucking disgusting smoking was and how disgusting I was for smoking. Even though I loved to smoke and I new I was lying to myself. Then from that day on, every time I saw someone smoking or smelled smoke, I would tell myself how gross it was. Soon I started believing my lie and now I find smoking completely disgusting. I have not smoked in almost 2 years. And yes, I can totally feel the difference. It wasn't until a month after I quite did I realize how shitty I felt from smoking and didn't even realize it. Anyway, good luck. If I can quit anyone can. ""I met my wife on an online game and lied telling her I was a nonsmoker.  We became inseparable there and the relationship progressed to an irl meeting.  I had to keep up the image so I used nicotine losenges to get me through that.  Once it became evident that what we felt online matched irl I quit and never looked back.  Married now for 5 years and those were the best two choices I've ever made.

I was 45 when I met her and had smoked since I was 17.""Failed after the patch, gum, Zyban, and more over five years.  I absolutely wanted to quit but it was too hard.  First three days of hell and irritability, then okay for a week, day ten seemed to always get me: I'm doing great I could have just one.  Same around day 30.  After that smooth sailing until you find yourself at the bar or walking outside with a smoker.

Anyway to answer your question, I started jogging while I was still smoking.  Every day in the morning.  I quit after a few months and jogging became immediately and noticeably easier.  I could run without shortness of breath and it felt like a dream.  I started taking my breaks together and going for short runs at work and just sponge bathing myself upon return.  So when the inevitable day 30 came around and my one smoke turned into two packs the shortness of breath came back with a vengeance.  Having tasted life with exercise and month-long clean lungs I had enough conviction to throw out my pack and never look back.  Cold turkey.  That was eight years ago already.  I notice now how well my taste buds and sense of smell work. I love to eat now and almost never get headaches.

I hope you find something that works for you.

As a college dropout who went back to school part time with a young family to care for and a guy who's had surgery a dozen times I can honestly say quitting smoking was by far the most difficult thing I've endured.  I think you're close to quitting.  Asking for help is a huge step.  You're well beyond admitting it's a problem.  Which is nice.  You've eliminated a lot of things that don't work for you so that's progress.

Good luck and don't give up.""Good ol' ass-whoopin! 

Seriously. When my dad found a pack of smokes in my room when I was 17, he came to my school, waited outside until I got out of school, and as I walked out, he showed me the pack of cigarettes and asked, ""What is this?"". Without waiting for an answer, he bitch-slapped the shit out of me in front of everyone and walked away. 

I quit cold-turkey from that day. ""Step by step guide to quit smoking. Tested and worked on myself and four other people.  
  
- You'll need about four days, so take two days off from work/school before or after the weekend.  
- Do not drink alcohol on those days / Do not drink much (or at all) during the first few weeks of not smoking 
- Allow yourself to eat whatever you want on those first four days, so go and buy all your favorite snacks first.  
- Smoke your last cigarette before going to bed and make sure that there are none left in your house. You'll wake up on day 1/4 and never smoke one again.  
- The best way to stop is to do things you usually don't do. Take walks, go jogging, drive somewhere (if you never smoked in your car), go swimming, work out. Eat and drink a lot.  
  
That's basically all there is to it. It's really important that you plan this and take your time off from things for the first few days. If you try to go about your usual daily business but ""just without smoking"" you will most likely fail. Remember, smoking is a habit. You are always smoking in the same situations, like waiting for the bus, having lunch break at work, etc. so you need as many new situations as possible for the transition.  
  
Edit: I smoked for 16 years, two packs a day for the last few years, and quit that way.""I smoked for 15 years. At the height of my addiction, I was smoking two packs a day. I tried quitting 6 times before I was finally successful and it was Nicoderm patches that finally got me through.

Quitting is problematic in two ways: first you have the actual physical addiction. It's a pain in the ass. For me, trying to quit cold turkey (without a nicotine supplement) raised my anxiety levels and would ultimately lead to ridiculous justifications for smoking ""just one cigarette.""

The second problem is the mental addiction. For me (and everyone I know who has quit), this is by FAR the hardest aspect of quitting smoking. When you smoke as much as I did, cigarettes are part of your life. They aren't a thing that you do to relax or for fun (the social smoker excuse), they are a habit so integrally wound into your life that you will have one hell of a hard time breaking it. I had a few triggers that I learned to identify through my failed attempts at quitting smoking. 1) I wanted a cigarette right after every meal. I never found a good solution to this one, although the wave of public smoking bans helped keep me from smoking after meals at restaurants. 2) I like to join other smokers outside for smoke breaks. If you've never been a smoker or if you're just not socially awkward, you probably don't understand this one. But there really is something comforting about smoke break social time. 3) This was the hardest. I liked to smoke when I used my computer. Whether it be gaming or...other activities....I would chain smoke when I was at my computer. When I finally quit smoking, I shut my computer down, thoroughly cleaned my computer desk of all ashes and ash trays, and then covered it with a sheet. I didn't touch my computer for three weeks after that because I knew if I did, that mental addiction would kick in and make me more likely to relapse.  There were other triggers too, those are just the highlights. What you have to do is find ways to break your habits and squash those triggers. It will mean that you have to change other aspects of your life besides just giving up cigarettes. If you really want to quit though, you'll do it. It's worth it. 

I grew up in the south on a tobacco farm. Smoking is a tradition in my family (so is lung cancer). Over the last decade I have watched 90% of my surviving family try to quit smoking cold turkey with no assistance (patches, counselling, etc) Every single one of them has failed. Some of them have failed numerous times. The same can be said for most of my friends who have tried to quit cold turkey without assistance. In fact, I can remember only one friend who was successful, but he had only smoked about a half a pack a day for a year. 

My best advice for you is to seek some type of assistance. For me, the patches helped tremendously. They almost completely staved off the physical addiction. I was able to work on breaking the habit (the mental addiction) without the added anxiety of the physical addiction. If you decide to go with patches, be sure you follow the step down plan completely. Don't tell yourself that you can rush through it to save money. Spend a little extra now and save yourself some money in healthcare costs later. Step down gradually and give yourself time to adjust. Also, you may not want to wear the patches at night. They gave me fucked up dreams and often I found myself unable to sleep well. So i took the patch off at night and applied a fresh one first thing in the morning. Lastly, I know the patches may irritate your skin a bit. They do burn a bit when you first put them on. If you can, work through it. It's worth it.

I also know many people who have gone through extensive counseling and have used medication to quit. Many of them have been successful as well. In fact, if I were quitting today, I would certainly explore that avenue. Smokefree.gov lists counseling with medication as one of the most effective means of smoking cessation (http://smokefree.gov/explore-quit-methods). 

No matter what you decide to do, you have got to start telling yourself right now that you will quit. You don't ""want"" to quit. You ""WILL"" quit. And do not ever fool yourself into thinking that you can have just one cigarette. I don't care if you quit for 4 weeks and decide that one smoke isn't going to kill you. Once you've been addicted, one cigarette will lead to justifications that you can have one cigarette per week. Then it will be one every other day. Then one per day.  After ten years of being smoke free, I absolutely refuse to let myself have a single cigarette. I've wanted them. Even now I find myself craving them occasionally. 

So consider something to help with the physical addiction. Patches, medication, something. I'm not sure if I'd recommend e-cigs because then you don't really break the habit of having a cigarette in hand. I guess they are still slightly better than filling your lungs with smoke though. It's a fucking hard battle, my friend. It's worth it though. Good luck!

Edit: I wrote a book...fuck. 

TLDR - get help (via supplement or medication and counseling). Make yourself quit. "Getting diagnosed with colon cancer."I smoked for 16 years and just quit one year ago.  I know it is for good because I decided in my mind I was no longer a smoker.  Once you decide that way, smoking a cigarette makes you feel kind of guilty instead of relaxed and calmed.

It also helped me to know that cigarette cravings are temporary.  They really are.  You can be sweating out an intense craving, then get a phone call and totally forget about it.  This is fairly unique to cigarettes.  As time goes by the craving will come less and less often.  After a month or so, you will notice cigarette smoke smells much different.  It smells really bad.  Instead of reminding you of smoking a cigarette, it will remind you of how bad cigarettes are, and how much they smell they leave in your hands, clothes, hair and breath.  How impossible it is to hide that smell.  I have a couple of friends that I cannot even ride in their car because the smoke smell is so bad.

During the first month, give yourself lots of stuff to do.  I would go walk up to a convenience store and get a large 44oz Iced tea full of ice (summer).  Something to drink, and lots of ice to chew on afterward.  Also went through a ton of gum and chewed on stuff like toothpicks, straws, and basically anything I could get my hands on.  If you choose a patch or nicotine gum, I think this makes it more difficult because the withdrawal period is prolonged instead of ""getting over it"" quickly.  At least in my experiences I found the gum just reminded me more of cigarettes and didn't give me enough nicotine to get the ""relaxation"" part of a cigarette.  I recommend staying away from smoker friends, particularly if alcohol is involved for the first month. Throw out or give away ALL cigarettes and ashtrays.  Then tell any smoker friends you have you are quitting and to try to not smoke around you (all of my smoker friends were very supportive).

Finally, if you do not regularly go to the gym and workout I would recommend giving it a shot.  This is a great time for change, and surrounding yourself with healthy people is very empowering.

If you are the type of person that is motivated by progress check out this [chart] (http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html).  Everything will get better I promise.  People quit all the time and are successful with the right frame of mind.  I had read about how it was so difficult to quit that I had already decided it was very hard; when I actually did it was easier than my preconceived notions.  I quit a serious alcohol addiction and that was much, much more difficult.  People quit drugs like heroin and meth, and to me I find that inspiring.  If they can do it, you can!  Good Luck!""4 years tomorrow.  You are not gonna want to hear this but for me it was cold turkey.

First, be ready and have some sort of plan.
-You HAVE to want to quit.
-It helps if you need to.
-It will take TIME.
-It helps if can put yourself into a position where you simply can't smoke for a period of time, and and know about it ahead of time.  (the 2nd part is critical)
-Identify your triggers so you have a chance at avoiding them, or being aware that it IS a trigger before it DOES trigger you. (stress, anxiety, other smokers, etc.)
-Identify your habits that are linked to smoking. (Driving, after meals, work breaks, etc.)

I'd wanted to quit for years, and had for months here and there, but kept getting sucked back in.  I have a very addictive personality, so this wasn't a surprise, but felt extremely defeating.  Still, it did arm me with some things that really did help me get close to quitting.  I twas the relapse that was an issue.

I had surgery coming up, so I needed to quit at least for a while anyways.  I did all of the stuff I listed above first, so I had a very clear idea of what I was up against.  I spent a good while trying to break my habits by cutting out one, or part of one until it didn't bother me much.  Start with an ""easy"" one, since it's likely to be 

I would smoke once after I got up, on the way to work, on morning break, lunch, pm break, on my way home, after supper, and some at night.  If I went out, I smoked more.

-I cut out the ""breakfast"" smoke, since it almost reflexive, and it also was when my nicotine levels were lowest.  I figured it would help me get more used to cutting back.
-I cut out the morning drive smoke for similar reasons to the ""breakfast"" smoke.
-I cut out my afternoon break smoke next, since I was jonesing pretty hard by the morning smoke.
...I cut them out like that, so it wasn't typically intolerable.  I got myself down from ~10 to 3 to 5 without too much difficulty.
-I made sure they didn't fall within old routine habits, but the ""Lunch"" smoke was hard.  Driving was hard as well, but my commute is really short.
-Next, I started waiting as long as I could before I NEEDED a smoke.  I did that every single one I had so that it wasn't at all habitual, but more like an as-needed med.  I was very careful to not have any of them become a new routine.

**First big milestone.  I think this is about 2 months in, give or take.  I really don't remember.

-I then decided I would only have 1 per day, with an emergency backup smoke.  I worked in nicotine lozenges, and kept with the mindset of it being medication.  I would still wait as long as possible.  I was stern with myself, so that if I pussed out and had one at 10am, I would not second guess myself and even THINK that i can just have the 2nd one later.  It was really for when I started to get really uncomfortable, crabby, etc.  It had to be that way.
-I quickly moved to only having one emergency smoke available a day.
-I started to purposefully think of smoking as nasty, and would try to put myself in a grouchy mood when smoking, focusing my angst on the smoke.  Seems lame, but it got me through.

**Second big milestone was after two weeks of the lozenge/smoke and then just lozange, I could DEAL with it.  I think I ended up having .5 to 1 smoke a week.  Shortly after that I had surgery, so I COULDN'T smoke for a couple weeks.  The last* one I had was September 14th, 2007.

**First big setback.  I had been on Roxicet, and it messed me up pretty good.  I then had a really hard time after I quit taking it, and was pretty depressed.  I had some bad luck with my car, getting stranded twice when I wasn't supposed to exert myself and yadda yadda.  So I smoked a 1/2 one here... and another one there...  This is why I gave an asterisk to my quit date.  I tried to make them very deliberate, but it's not easy when you just don't care.  Once i was out of my funk, that was that. I'd guess I had 2 to 4 smokes (each smoked twice) over two weeks.

-Once I got my head back together, I realized I really didn't care for the stink on other at work.  I realized I could smell and taste things better.  I didn't feel like shit when I woke up in the mornings.  I started to REALLY feel better.  I had earlier, but not like this.

**Third milestone - I quit DREAMING about smoking.  I didn't have one in my hand, ""dream me"" would be bothered by others smoking.  If I DID have a smoke in my dream, I would wake up PISSED!  Then I'd realize it was just a dream, and be only mildly pissed.

Now I NEVER dream about smoking.  I might have had one dream a couple years ago.  I had a kid a few years back, and there have been random weird moments when I thought, ""Man, I could go for a smoke.""  I never did, and only actually considered it a couple times.  Thing is, I won't touch a cigar or anything.  Any slip can set me back years or get me smoking again.  That helps keep me in check.

One unmentioned bonus somewhere in here is that the smoking policy at work changed.  You couldn't smoke on the grounds, and it's about a mile drive to get out.  That helped at some point, since my break smokes were simply not an option.

I'm sure I missed plenty of details, but there it is."The easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr. "I just focused on how bad each cigarette made me feel. As every smoker does, I tried to ignore the terrible feeling I would get after each cigarette. When I stopped ignoring that feeling, the urge to smoke stopped.""same here. i found myself feeling nauseated after each smoke. if i remembered that feeling when i had a craving, that eventually did the trick"I got pregnant ;)"I read ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" by Alan Carr.

For me, the key is no casual smoking. Also, I would smoke a joint every time I wanted a cigarette. In hindsight, maybe not the best tactic. I still have nightmares where I pick up a cigarette and my sleeping mind is screaming 'noooooo!' I don't know if those will ever stop. My brother quit after reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking."$11 for a pack in Chicago.  WTF!  FU cigarettes! I Quit!"I tried several times to quit and failed until one day when I went out and played racquetball for about two hours. I came home dehydrated and exhausted. I sat down and ate a big meal and then had my traditional post-meal smoke. Not long after, I barfed up a technicolor rainbow. 

After cleaning up my mess, I went to bed. The next morning, over coffee, I went to have my first cig of the day. As soon as I lit it, all I could think of was the smell and taste of vomit. It was disgusting. 

I stubbed it out. And then I thought: This is the perfect time to quit. My brain has a reason to hate cigarettes. 

That was in 1980. It was the last cigarette I ever smoked. ""To be honest, regardless of what medicines or NRTs you try it's 99% willpower.

I gave up smoking probably about 4 or 5 years ago now and I did it using patches. But I had got to a point where I was ready to quit- I LOATHED being a slave to nicotine. I felt utterly controlled by my addiction and I was desperate to be free. But when I tried to quit years previously to that I gave in a day later because I still loved smoking.

If you're not 100% dedicated to quitting, and really have a reason to quit, you'll probably struggle."My old boss told me how he quit. He said you have to have a reason.

I was a pack a day smoker and tried the patch, gum, cold turkey, etc.  Nothing worked.  If I went more than 4 hours without a cig I'd get a lump in my throat from craving it so bad.  I can't explain what was so effective about this book but it made sense to me, and worked for three of my friends as well.  ""Coming up on a year completely smoke free, stopped smoking a pack a day eighteen months ago.

I was starting to feel the physical effects of smoking for so long, I couldn't run down the block without weezing, so that was number two. Finally I read Alan Carr's book ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" and that was really the nail in the coffin for me, smoked one last cigarette and never looked back. But utimatley it was just an utter test of will power every moment of every day for months and months, my brain tried everything to rationalize smoking again and at the end of the day I simply just did not smoke. At this point I honestly do not crave a smoke at all and quitting is my proudest accomplishment. Good luck mate, pm me if you ever need some advice."Vaping."Little bit of background:

I had my first cigarette in 5th grade, had about 1 a week to be ""cool"" up until 6th grade, then started smoking addictively in seventh grade. I got up to a pack a day by the summer following eighth grade. I kept that going until last year, which was my junior year. So I smoked for about 4 years adictively, 7 if you want to count my ""experimental"" phase.

First thing's first, don't expect it to be easy, and don't expect the urge to go away. My first time quitting was my sophomore year, didn't go well at all. I made it about 2 weeks in and I was mad because I was expecting the urge to want a cigarette to go away. That's when I found out that wanting to smoke sticks with you for life, it doesn't just magically go away, just like every other addiction. It gets a lot easier, but certain things will always make you have an extreme craving for a cigarette. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you can quit.

Like I said, my first attempt to quit was failed due to frustration. My second failed attempt was at the end of my sophomore year. I made it about 3 months before summer started. In summer, I found myself getting REALLY bored. One of the things that make me want to smoke is getting REALLY bored, so eventually I broke. Turns out the ""Cold Turkey"" approach just wasn't cutting it.

At the end of my junior year my Mom bought me an e-cigarette (I was 17 at the time, she knew I smoked, and while she didn't like it she knew she wasn't going to be able to stop me, so she did the best she could to help me quit. It also helped that she was also a smoker at the time.) This worked absolute wonders for a few months, but every time I hung out with my pals (Who are all smokers), I'd end up bumming a few off of them.

In the end, I bumped up my nicotine level. It's really trading one addiction for the other. Using 24 mg juice helped me fully quit, although the urge was still there, when I had it I would just bust out my e-cig and hit it constantly. I'm not here to preach about how amazing e-cigs are, because in the end they are still harmful (Putting foreign chemicals into your body), but they are MUCH less harmful than cigarettes. Not to mention a lot more convenient and cheaper (Although FDA taxes are coming very soon, so it will get much more expensive)

After I was able to fully give up the cigarettes for the e-cig, I devised a plan to slowly ween myself off the nicotine. Starting at 24 mg, I decided every 2 weeks I would drop down a level. So on my 3rd week I got 18 mg instead of 24. 2 weeks later, I got 16 instead of 18, so on and so forth. It's worked extremely well, and while I still crave a cigarette due to certain triggers, I can still overcome the urge.

Mainly the key is to have the correct mind set. I read some article on the internet a while ago that after 3 days without a cigarette your physical addiction is gone. I'm not sure how accurate that is, but if it's true that means that you only have a mental addiction after 3 days. This means that any withdrawal symptoms you may be experiencing should go away. I personally didn't have any symptoms other than one hell of a cough, but that subsided rather quickly. The rest is up to you in order to keep under control.

Next time you decide to quit, make sure you know that the urge won't go away. If you expect it to, when it comes back it will catch you off guard. It might take every bit of willpower in your body, but when the urge comes around, do your best to get your mind off of it. Try to avoid smokers for the first bit of time; they are essentially your biggest trigger at first. Know that quitting is a process, not an immediate thing. You won't wake up one day and be all ""I'M CUREDDDDDDDDDDD"" and start dancing like you're some character from Mary Poppins. It simply won't happen, so don't expect it, and don't get discouraged when it doesn't.

I decided to quit when I woke up with a noticeable wheeze one morning a few days before NYE. It's been almost a month since I've smoked - cold turkey, because that's the only way I can break habits - and let me tell you, I'm on the verge of driving a schoolbus full of orphans off a bridge, that's how much I want to smoke. But I feel fresher, fitter, less smelly, my skin is beginning to clear up, my teeth are whiter, and I have more money.

/first reddit post""Basically, I started mentally associating smoking a cigarette with only the negative effects opposed to the short positives.

I would stop buying packs but always ended up bumming cigs from people at work.  My work buddy got fed up one day and said, ""Dude, either buy a new pack or quit.  You're not getting any more cigs from me.""  So I thought okay, I guess I'll see how long I can last without.  For the next few days when I was really jonesing, I would tell myself that I don't want a cig because I am a non-smoker.  I stayed inside every time people went outside to smoke.  After about a week, the hardcore cravings went away.  After a few months, so did the psychological desire.

That was 2008, and I haven't had a cigarette since.  I met my wife a few months later, and she told me she never would have gone out with me had I been a smoker.

Come the 14th, I'll have been six months without a smoke, and I haven't looked back. In college, I tried to quit with the patch, but just ended up smoking on it (and had amazing dreams). I'd tried varenicline twice before, both times at the normal dosing (0.5 mg 1x/day for a week, then 1 mg, then 2 mg), and it ended up the same way both times: horrible nausea and GI issues, then major depressive episodes. Also, being doped up like that felt like a crutch. This time, I had some of it left over and just used an exceedingly small amount to get me through.

 * TELL everyone in advance that you are going to do it on that date.  Now you look like a wimp if you don't make a good effort.  Shame is a great motivator.

 * When the day comes, on the first second of that day if you're still awake, put your last butt out, screw up the packet, and throw that and your lighter/matches in the bin.  Preferably in front of witnesses.  By showing everyone else you mean it, you've also sent a message to your own subconcious.

 * Do NOT use gum or patches.  These things simply maintain your nicotine addiction while letting your lungs clean - you might as well just switch to e-cigarettes.  You want to stop using then grow a pair and  fucking STOP!

 * Remember that every day, even at the height of your addiction, you have managed to go 8 hours without a smoke - you sleep.  That means that that craving you get every few minutes after a half hour is just your pussy brain being a whining bitch.  Tell it to STFU - you have better things to do than standing out in the rain sucking vaporous snake venom into your face.

And two more things to keep in mind throughout, and afterwards:

 1. It gets easier.  After a while, not only do you not want one, you can't even stand the smell of smoke any more.

 2. DO NOT think you're over it, and it's safe to have ""just one"" at a party or something.  You aren't, and it isn't.  You're an alcoholic on the wagon.

I'm still quit.""so much retarded shit in this thread.  the patch, straight up, put it on right around dinner time it goes for 24 hours and you never wake up with cravings, takes 12 weeks and 3 steps and you're off.  The mental addiction gets better after 3-5 days if you can survive those days you already made it, but you have to actually want to quit.  I quit for 2 1/2 years now after 12 years of smoking with just generic walgreens patches.""I have been smoker for 7 years 2 and half packs a day. I gave up smoking for 7 years now. The only thing that worked for me was a lots of water. I mean 3-5 litters a day. It helps flushing your system from nicotine so you don't have long nicotin withdrawal time. 

Sry for my english""Money money money! I'm in Toronto, our sin tax is ridiculously high. Smokes are over 10 a pack! 

I was literally spending over 250 a month on smokes!

I half ass tried to quit a couple times ... Cutting back and whatever. Didn't stick too it...

I managed to do it cold turkey ... That shit is fucking hard the first week. I felt horrible. But it gets easier! 

All you have to do is each day not. Fucking. Smoke! The worst was going out drinking ... I ended up hammered because I needed something to do with my hands so I just kept smashing beers hahahah!

Did I mention the money?! I quit in sept. BOOM $1000 by now!!!""I have been tobacco and nicotine free for six days now after being a heavy smoker for ten years. It doesn't sound like much, but it's a big deal for me, considering I was a half-to-full-pack-a-day smoker for the last two years. I always told myself that quitting cold turkey would be too hard, so I made excuses and never fully gave it up. 
Here's what worked for me. I went out for my birthday last week and got ridiculously wasted. Such was my inebriation that I was totally sick to my stomach for the next two days. I didn't even want a cigarette those two days. By the time I started feeling better, I hadn't smoked in three full days, so I decided to just keep it going. It's still really hard to think about without a craving, but it has gotten easier and easier to resist. I also spent the first week without nicotine trying to fill my time with activities that keep me moving. I started jogging and my breathing is already improved.
Also, telling my friends I was tobacco free helped when I wanted to break down and smoke, but didn't want to ruin the streak I had bragged about to my friends.

TL;DR- I didn't smoke for a few days while sick, decided to keep it going when I felt better. Tell your friends. They will be glad."I've quit a few times. I am recently a non- smoker again and feel great!! This time around I used medication (bupruion) zyban and nicotine patches. I also used the vapor cigarette while doing this for about two weeks then just stopped. I have also chewed on peppercorns and that helped. Bottom line is you won't die from quitting smoking but you may if you continue!! Stay strong!!!"Thank you so much and best of luck to you, too!"trying and failing over and over again. the more you try the easier it getsWill power and Nicorette."That's how I did it. Everyone above is saying ""cold turkey,"" but that didn't work for me. I had to have something. Nicorette, sun flower seeds, and Arrested Development (this was years ago). Also, I moved houses so I had no smoking routines built in. That part was coincidence, but it really did help. ""I can't believe E-cigs aren't in the top few comments. You get the throat hit, an amazing taste, and you can ramp down the nicotine level until you're vaping 0mg. There's also a great community of support at /r/electronic_cigarette ""This is what worked for me: I just stopped smoking one day. Sounds too easy to be true,right? The key to my success was keeping the whole quitting process to myself.  

I smoked for 20 years...quit multiple times, yet I always picked the habit back up. Nothing I did seemed to help me quit smoking.  
One day, while suffering through another cessation, it just dawned on me from out of the blue...I realized the reason I was having such a problem quitting: I was allowing myself to be consumed with the idea of quitting, to the point of constantly thinking about cigarettes. I was broadcasting the fact that I was quitting to my friends and family, with updates, pleas of encouragement, etc...I was constantly thinking about smoking by thinking about NOT smoking...ACTIVELY thinking about it always, until I broke down and smoked, to stop 'torturing' myself; I would beat myself up for cheating, then give up, not willing to further disappoint myself.  

One day, I just decided to stop. No broadcasting it to my loved ones/friends/Facebook. No looking for encouragement...no concentration on the process. I just stopped. Now, I did have the usual 'withdrawal' period, but I suffered it in silence, and surprisingly, it wasn't as bad this time, because I wouldn't allow myself to dwell on it. I took a few days off from work, and went to the Outer Banks/Virginia Beach area...I had never been, and figured a break from the norm would further get me away from my habit triggers. Plus, the excitement of seeing new places kept my mind off of it. A week later, I returned home, feeling refreshed and relaxed....and smoke-free.

I've been smoke free for almost a year. If I have a craving, I will ask a friend for a drag (like once a month), rather than bum one or buying smokes. For me, denying myself that craving would only make me want to smoke more.  

Finally, when you do get to the point where you realize 'Hey, I've been smoke-free for *x* months, Don't make a big deal out of it or congratulate yourself. Just focus on how much better you feel without cigarettes in your life. Good luck!  

Ninja edit: words, and shit.
""I quit by using Swedish Snus. It's an oral tobacco that is spitless. You put it under your upper lip...sort of like the old Ronco Rostisserie Commercials, ""set it and forget it!"". I had tried cold turkey, pills, patches and gum and none of them worked successfully. I researched other methods of quitting and I did not want the ecig because I thought it would just lead me back to smoking ""analogs"". 

I found about harm reduction methods and Swedish Snus came up. The more I found out about it and all of the success stories I heard, the more I was interested in trying it. It took me about 2 weeks to make the switch from cigs to snus. Almost two years later, I have been completely smoke free. While I am still getting nicotine, I am using a product that has been proven to be 95-99% safer than cigs. I suggest if you are having a really hard time...give it a try. 

Hopefully this doesn't get buried because OP /u/barbiesarthritis this was the only thing that worked for me and so many others also. Check some of these links to get some solid information on this product. Also, there are literally hundreds of flavors and strengths to choose from. Just stay away from american snuses like camel, marlboro, skoal snus, etc. You can buy General snus in most convenience stores across the US.

Please check this out!!!! I think this could really help you!! I was in the same boat as you, now thanks to Snus, I am totally smoke free and loving life.
""In Houston, I was only able to find General brand Snus at certain tobacco shops, and one location of Spec's (our big liquor and specialty food store).  I would suggest going to the General website, they have a 'where to buy' page.""[This is the most complete page I have found](http://www.pmi.com/eng/our_products/snus/pages/health_effects_of_swedish_snus.aspx#) discussing Sweedish Snus. It is from Philip Morris International, [but they also produce Swedish snus,](http://www.pmi.com/eng/about_us/company_overview/pages/our_brands.aspx) (look under Smokeless) and are not trying to keep people from buying their product. They cite a great many studies.  
Swedish Snus is a harm reduction product. It does reduce instances of tobacco related lung cancer by a minimum of 90%, but it is not harmless, particularly for pregnant women. It can contribute to heart disease and while it reduces cancer instances by at least 30% for pancreatic cancer, at least 50% and probably more for oral and other gastrointestinal cancer, it still more than doubles the pancreatic cancer rate for people with no tobacco use.   
If you have been smoke free for 2 years, it could not hurt to try to become nicotine free. 

""Been a smoker for only five years. I tried to quit as early as my third year. I thought I can just gradually quit, like 19 sticks tomorrow, then 18 sticks on the second day, then 17 sticks on the third, and so on. and replace the sticks with candies and gums. But it didn't work. I always find myself consuming a few more sticks than what I intended and after some time I officially forgot I'm trying to quit and I'm back smoking a full pack a day again. I tried to quit four times before my fifth year of smoking, but all failed.

Then a little over my fifth year into smoking, I just said to myself ""Fuck it, I don't like the feelings I get from smoking."" I stopped cold turkey. The previous day I smoked more than half pack, the next day I didn't smoked any at all. Withdrawal symptoms were intense though. I feel like I'm losing my mind. ""Go to the store!"" my mind tells me. After a few days, I gave up, and followed what my head is telling me. ""Go to the store,"" it says so I went to the store. I was about to buy a pack when suddenly I realized I'm already several days smoke-free. I bought a softdrink instead.

And that's how it's been. Whenever my mind tells me to go to the store, pressumably to buy cigarettes, I would go but I would buy a softdrink instead. This continued on for the next few months. Eventually I got an addiction for softdrinks and not the cigarettes. When I realized I no longer crave for even a stick of cigarette, it's huge sigh of relief. Yeah, I became a softdrink addict in the process but unlike with cigarettes, I found it easier to quit softdrinks.

Today I'm smoke-free for more than a year now. Whenever I find myself in situations where I would smoke in the past, I'll go to the store and buy a different thing instead.

**TLDR:** Cold Turkey, but getting addicted to softdrinks helped me deal with the withdrawal symptoms. I found it easier to quit my softdrink addiction after that."Marijuana"chantix.  only thing that even came close to getting me off smoking.  but, beware of the side effects.  What keeps me from going back is knowing I'll want to quit eventually, and I never want to experience chantix's side effects again. "I had no issues with Chantix. But it was before a lot of the side effects were known so I wasn't aware I should be having them. "I tried chantix and stopped before I should have. the side effects were brutal. I didn't smoke for 4 months or so, then started again.
Before trying Chantix make sure to consult a doctor and possibly a psy.""You have to want it, and I mean truly want it. It's not enough to just know that you should or wish you could.

I didn't smoke the 'typical' pack a day, more like two packs a week. i have an e-cig but its nicotine content is so low that its more about flavor and the oral satisfaction than about the kick.""Sipping ice water through a straw. That shit really helped for the sensation and oral fixation, and it doesn't cost anything. Well, you pay for the straw.""My boss was a smoker of around 50 years (seriously). He had and emergency open heart surgery after they discovered that his aorta had cracked all over. Mind you smoking has nothing to do with this and is not proved to cause aorta enlargement. His wife then told him he has to quit smoking now, or this is it. He stopped cold turkey and hasn't touched a cigarette in over 2 years now. He still talks about how much he misses it and how he wishes he was smoking right now.""Sigarette smoking weakens the walls of the arteries, so it very likely had to do with 50 yrs of smoking."tell him how he should be really happy about having made the right decision instead of having regrets about it.Fallout 3"100% you have to want it. No amount of cessation aids will get you there alone. 

I didn't smoke regularly, but dipped for 20+ years.  They say quitting dipping is even harder than quitting smoking because of the amount of nicotine.  I tried and failed many times to quit, but kept falling back into the habit.  I hadn't been to the dentist in 15 years because I was afraid what I would hear.

What finally worked for me was a combo of three things:

1- Wanting to.  Really wanting to for my family.

2- I joined an online community of people trying to quit.  Daily roll call, the works.

3- Patches
"did you eventually go to the dentist? what'd they say/find?Nicotine patch and chewing gum. "I quit two years ago, cold turkey.  I decided I should give it a try for my 27th birthday, as a sort of """"gift for myself.""  I continued to look up the changes in my body that would happen after a certain length of time without a cigarette.  For example, within twenty minutes after a cigarette, your pulse rate, temperature and blood pressure will have returned to normal.  This motivated me to keep going.  I had felt health problems coming on more often while I smoked so to know that my body was healing, helped me in successfully quitting.""3 years without a cigarette here:

It was a change of my behavior.  I was deployed and smoked in a pattern.  When I came home, I didn't have the same patterns.  ""I am 35 years old and I started dipping when I was 11.  I quit about 18 months ago.  I quit several times before that, but I would only be able to go about 1-3 months at a time before I started again.

This time, I feel like I have done it.  Believe it or not, helping a friend deal with alcoholism was eye opening for me.  My friend cannot handle Alcohol.  One drink spins into a week long black out bender.  Despite everyone pleading with him and several ""rock bottom"" moments, he would always go right back to it.  In the end, he had to decide for himself that he COULDN'T drink.  Not a single sip.

I'm the same way with tobacco.  I like it.  I enjoy it.  But I don't want it anymore.  So my first step was making that decision.  My next step was sticking to that decision.  That part was the hard part.  I'll tell you my two steps and maybe they will help you...

STEP 1 - Deciding I wanted to quit.  I always knew in the back of my mind that tobacco is like Russian Roulette.  The longer you play, the worse your odds get.  And I had always planned to quit at some point.  Now I have a family with two kids.  One day I had a sore in my lip that I didn't know what it was.  I started to think....""Is this *it*?  ...Do I have mouth cancer?"".  Then I started to think how very stupid I would feel if I had to look my wife and daughters in the eyes and tell them I wouldn't be around much longer because of a stupid habit.  I liked it, but was it worth it?  For me, it was not.  But I had to make that decision on my own.  I had to WANT to quit.  Every other time, I was quitting for other people.

STEP 2 - Sticking to the decision.  Not a single time.....  I quickly realized that one dip turned into two.  Two turned into buying my own can.  Then it's off to the races.  I would convince myself that I could handle just one without starting back up.  And every single time, I was wrong.  So once, I came to the realization that I personally cannot handle dip...I was golden.  That's not to say I don't still have temptation.  But I just have to remember that I have that hard, fast rule.... Not a single time.

BTW, for me personally this included all substitutes.  I tried pouches, I tried Snus, Shredded mint, Shredded beef jerky, even putting gum in my lip.  But it was always a slippery slope and even if they were tobacco free, all of them kept the habit alive.

Now I'm 18 months in and going strong.  But just like they say in AA...you take it one day at a time.  Which basically means you have to stay on guard all the time, every day.  You can't ever consider yourself to have ""crossed the finish line"" and assume that it's all behind you.  If you are like me, you are a tobacco addict.  And even if you don't use tobacco, you are still an addict.  Your body and brain will still respond the same way if you have tobacco after a 10 year absence.  So you have to stay vigilant.

Also, as a footnote... I consider it a challenge.  I imagine it as me vs. the craving.  Can I persevere?  Can I be stronger than the temptation?  ""I won't let this fucker beat me.""  So I hold strong.  Hope that helps.""My daughter.

I started at age 11, when my sister realized I wouldn't be able to tell on her if she got me to start doing it too.  We lived in a small town in Missouri, it was the mid-90's, and there were plenty of older teens & early 20-somethings around who were willing to buy them for us, in addition to that shady convenience store who would sell cigarettes to any little kid who said they were for Mom or Dad.

I quit when I went to boarding school for the last couple years of high school, but started again as soon as I got back home & could actually buy them myself, legally.  I really liked cloves.

I didn't smoke while I was pregnant, at 21 years old, but being around my kid's dad who still smoked, and having a ""smoking room"" in the back of our house, was too much for me to handle & I started again a couple months after she was born.

Tried to quit many times.  Quit cold turkey for a solid week, right before I was assaulted very badly by my daughter's dad.  He went to jail that night, and I discovered a pack of cloves (now banned in the US) in my luggage while packing to leave him.

Several years later, my daughter started coughing.  It was winter & everyone was sick off & on, but this cough just wouldn't ever really go away.  For months, she coughed; sometimes not as bad & sometimes alarmingly bad.  I took her to the doctor several times, but there wasn't anything measurably wrong with her.  She wasn't sick, per se, but she had been recently, so that *might* explain it, kind-of.  Then, the doc had an epiphany.  The cigarette smoke.  She was reacting to it, on me, on my skin & clothes, the upholstery of the car.  I didn't smoke around my daughter, never inside, & not in the car with her.  But the residue coats everything.  The cough wasn't going to go away on its own; she would likely end up developing asthma as a result of the chronic exposure to tobacco smoke residue.  

That made up my mind for me.  I was no longer a smoker.  I took her home, went to the store & bought a bunch of industrial cleaning products. Scrubbed the inside of my car, washed all our clothes & bedding & coats & scarves & couch blankets.  I didn't smoke again, and her cough went away within a week.  That was 2 years ago.

Tl;dr - Smoked from a young age, couldn't kick it until my habit was on the way to giving my child asthma.  Quit cold turkey the day the doctor told me to.  Two years strong."the girl I fancied found cigarettes to be revolting."I smoked for 25 years..   The key is to quit fucking lying to yourself or making lame excuses and just stop smoking.  Yeah, sometimes it sucks, especially during the first month, but you got yourself into a shitty situation, now get yourself out.  

Deciding to actually quit worked best.  I got it in my mind that I'm no longer a smoker and stopped.  No bullshit about 'only if I drink' or 'only socially', or using e-cigarettes.  I stopped smoking (mostly) in certain places, like in the car, certain social situations, before work, etc.  This helped a little, but I found I'd just smoke more during the times I was allowed to smoke.   
So, cold turkey worked best.  I went back to smoking a few times during the first 4 months, but would accept the relapse and try again.  Counting days since my last smoke helped a bit - trying to beat my last record.  Then on my 4th fall I said, 'fuck this - no more'  and it's now been 14+ months.""I only smoked for 10 years but I had the same outlook as you. After my 3rd relapse I was like ""Wait, I'm stronger than this, fuck you nicotine, eat my balls"" and it's been 3 years now. ""Chantix.  Will power.  And spending 30-60 minutes reading and re-reading sections of this every single day - http://whyquit.com/NTAP_large_print_212_pages.pdf 
I'm 2 years smoke free!  Back to running, exercising, playing hockey and tasting and smelling my food!""Each time I failed and bought a pack of cigarettes, I would smoke that cigarette, get my nicotine fix and crush the pack into a tiny ball and throw it into the nearest trash recepticle.

Try that a few times at the cost of cigarettes and you will quit.  If some jerk offers you a cigarette, do the same thing to his pack and people will stop enabling you as well.""I set a date well into the future. I think I decided in December, and selected 4/1 (I know) as my quit date. 

Then I told everyone. I talked about it. A lot. I built up my social obligation to follow through. Meanwhile, I had time for it to start to feel real, to become integrated into my day-to-day life. All this time I smoked as much as I ever did, without worrying about it. 

On 3/31 I bought a pack, invited all my friends to my ""great smoke out"", smoked myself silly. Walked home with my girlfriend at bartime, smoked the last one, and threw it out only half-done. Done. 

My problem was I'd always try to quit on a whim, but I had no investment in it, so as soon as I got a craving I'd say ""fuck it"". No one would know that I'd failed, and I could tell myself that I wasn't all that serious about it in the first place. What really worked for me was creating a commitment device that would significantly raise the price of failure. Also give yourself something to do when the cravings hit - they general don't last that long, but having a plan in place for how to approach them is good; whether that's gum or whatever. 

Now (~7 years later) I'm in the best shape of my life, and I'm able to bum a smoke off a friend from time to time for old-times sake. 

You can do it OP! ""I second setting a date and telling everyone.

Setting  a date allows you to prepare for the smoking cessation. This helps with the psychological aspect of the addiction.  You cannot just up and quit, you MUST prepare for it.

Telling everyone helps create an informal support group.  Your friends and coworkers really do want you to quit.

Several people have said cold turkey is the only way to quit and that is absolutely true.  You cannot ween yourself off cigarettes.""The method isn't the issue, it's how bad you actually want to quit. I'd tried before, but wasn't really into it, so eventually I'd cave. When I quit last year, it was because I was seriously done with it and told myself I wanted to smoke less than I wanted to give in to the craving. Because that's how I truly felt.

I tried the gum, but that gave me bad sores in my mouth, so after a week, I just gave up cold turkey. Used my stubbornness in my favour for a change whenever I got a craving and just kept telling myself I was stronger than that.

tl;dr: It's all on you. good luck.""Last January first I quit...cold.  No patches, no drugs, nothing...just stopped.  First couple of weeks were a bit hard, but I stuck to it.  After that first month, I was home free and haven't had a craving or looked back since.

It's like many things in life...it has to be a lifestyle change.""Smoked for 5 years and one day I decided that I hate feeling like shit all the time so I stopped.  Haven't since and I work in a hookah lounge. I also don't smoke that either. 
""Allan Carrs book, Easy way to quit smoking...I'm not even going to scroll down and see if more people reccomended it. Hopefully ten thousand people do... It really works, if you're also at the point that you really want to quit.

  I smoked a pack a day for thirteen years, and have been off now for two months, with no patches or gum or any substitutes. And Haven't thought of smoking once.""My dad smoked since he was 12. He would stop when my brother and I were born but always started back up. He used the gum, the patch, and always started smoking again. Then a few years ago he took Champix (I'm pretty sure) and he quit. He hates the smell and taste now and has zero urges to smoke. 

He did say it gave him extremely vivid dreams and nightmares which is kinda messed up. "I guess you just need to want it badly enough.  I've been trying to stop buying my nails...  Another difficult habit to shake. :("Same problem with the nail biting. Sucks but I stopped by putting that nasty no bite on my fingers and then nail polish. Now of you're a dude, just put the no bite on like the tip of the nail. You'll taste it and it's ridiculously gross. It'll stop you :) also don't eat any finger foods. Only downside to it""That is more difficult to break out of, because you can't exactly throw your fingers in the bin.""I had a time in my life where i could not afford that many cigarettes so i reduced the amount i smoke until one day i was like ""you are only smoking two cigarettes per day anyway, might aswell quit""""Don't buy cigarettes anymore. Constantly having to bum one will either make you guilty after the tenth time, or people will just stop giving them to you. Whatever amount of money you were about to spend on cigarettes, spend it on someone else and do something good, or buy fast food and create a whole new terrible habit of getting fast good all the time. ""I smoked from age 14-15 to 20. 1-2 packs a day since 2 weeks after i started. I loved smoking. I'm 27 now and haven't smoked for the last 7 years. All the other adults in my immediate family still smoke.

I just looked over at an ashtray one day. I had been particularly lazy about emptying that one so it was way too full. I thought; fuck, you're disgusting. And once i'd had thought that, i knew i couldn't keep going with smoking.

I think if i had been able to see myself as a more moderate smoker, i might've had no problem with it and kept going. I liked the taste, the sensation and the other smokers. But i fucking hate looking at myself and thinking i'm *addicted* to something. *dependent* on something like ciggarettes. Ugh. I don't think there is any better feeling than identifying a part of my life that i think i am addicted to and completely ridding myself of it. 

...


...maybe i am addicted to *that* - god damn!""I decided I didn't want to be a smoker and a father. I switched to ecigs and only ""smoked"" 3 times a day, I planned these times out, and forced myself to adhere to it. That cut down to 2 times and from there I just stopped. It's been almost 2 years.""My then 8 month old daughter. 
Winter 2009, Calgary AB, my day off. I left my daughter on her high-chair and stepped out the back door (I don't smoke indoors) to have a nicotine fix. I drew the blind up so she could see me outside and won't cry. Finished my cigs and tried to open the door but it was frozen shut, (-25å¡C or -13å¡F outside) tried for 5 minutes but feel like a long time and my daughter started crying. When I finally open the door, she was imitating the hand to mouth motion of smoking and at that moment, I know I'm not a good role model for my daughter, also the  wife complains that our daughter smells like an ashtray when she comes from work to kiss her. Listed myself to a Smoking Cessation Class and quit cold turkey before the graduation.""If smoking in your car is something you can't get over either, I suggest talk radio. I just needed something to think about and distract me from wanting a smoke. The only problem is now I still listen to it a year later.""Discovering my wife was pregnant with our first child was what pushed me to really quit for good. I decided I did not want to be the reason he became a smoker when he grew up. I knew so many younger kids when I was in middle school and high school who smoked because their parents smoked. I would like to live long enough to see him grow into an adult as well. It sucked to quit, and every time I see a cigarette on television or see a co worker smoking it makes me want one. I avoid this by avoiding the places where I would normally smoke. If I were you I would just choose to not take a break over hurting your health with cigarettes. In the end you have to really WANT to quit. and its never going to be easy, the cravings won't go away, and you will likely have to give up some other things that were triggers for making you want to smoke.

EDIT: I also quit cold turkey. I would get rid of the electronic cigarette as it is just going to keep you buying the real ones. I had to quit using a very nice hookah that I had bought because it would kickstart my cigarette smoking (not to mention it's super bad for you)""After 15 years of smoking I am now six years without a puff.  If you read through the thread below you will discover there are many methods to quitting (the patch, hypnosis, cold turkey) and everyone of them have one thing in common.
You have to want to quit.  Not cut down, not want to take a break. You have to treat it like a bad relationship and end it.  Don't let it back in your house, your car, and if your friends are hanging out with it...for awhile you can not be friends with them.
Don't go to places where it will be.
Don't think that having just one is alright. 
Don't let it in.
Get rid of everything that reminds you of it.  Throw away the ashtrays, the lighters, the cigarette case someone got you once.
You have to want to quit, you have to want to be a non-smoker.""I had been smoking around three packs a week until I started complaining about pain in my mouth. Turns out my wisdom teeth were coming out and during this time I started smoking less because of the pain. When I went to the dentist I only had enough money to take one out and I was too afraid of dry socket so I just stopped smoking. I still had the urge kind of... but to me it was like a sort of unspoken rule I made myself follow about not smoking during this time. I waited two weeks and then took out another tooth. After that I realized I had gone a month without smoking, which totally took me by surprise! The final nail in the coffin happened one night when I really wanted to try smoking again and I could not stop hacking. I just couldn't smoke anymore. Now it's been 14 weeks and I feel great :) I quit on accident!"Quit cold turkey. For the first couple weeks I used cinnamon sticks to fill the void of a cigarette between my fingers after meals and driving. Driving was hardest. I had no idea what to do without a cigarette. ">""health care-you only get a break if you step outside and light up.""

Firstly, this is a lie you tell yourself. Go take that 20 minute break and do something else.
""I don't smoke but some friends of mine do. One of them just quit cold turkey. She hasn't had a cigarette for about 4 years now and she used to smoke 20 cigarettes a day.

My other friend has switched to ecigs. He doesn't want to quit smoking but he wanted to try something cheaper and a little less toxic so he has gone on the ecigs. Strangely though he now hates the taste of a real cigarette. His smell and taste have improved since he switched to ecigs and now real cigarettes make him feel unwell.""I went to the dentist.  He looked in my mouth, and said ""You're a smoker, aren't you?""  I said ""Yes.""  He said ""You're going to have throat cancer if you don't stop.""

I stopped.  

As Mark Twain once said, ""There are several good defenses against temptation.  Cowardice is the surest.""""Chantix, or whatever it is in the states, Champex or something. Smoked for 10 years, tried patches, gum, mints, nothing worked. One day I decided I'd had enough, got a prescription. How much of it was the drug and how much of it was the want to quit I can't really say, but I am coming up on 4 years smoke free so I can't argue with that.""I quit cold turkey, aided by hallucinogens. I had an epiphany that I did not want to die of lung cancer after smoking nearly 2 packs during the trip. That night was the last I smoked a cigarette and it's been over 6 months.""I switched to American Spirits for a few months. They don't have the additives in them like the other cigs, so you are smoking tobacco for tobacco's sake, not because of some crazy chemical. Then after partying in New Orleans for Mardi Gras and smoking like a chimney I quit cold turkey once I got to midnight of Ash Wednesday. I'm not Catholic but I realized I had been smoking four years so I figured I would quit for at least 40 days of Lent. When lent was over I lit up, said what the fuck am I doing, this tastes like ass and quit for the most part. Ill still smoke on special occasions like a cigar at a wedding or hookah on a friends birthday but otherwise I'm done.""In addition to the cold turkey technique, look at all the negatives of smoking (not like ""I'm getting cancer"",because honestly that won't affect you) but things like: its expensive, it's time consuming, it makes your teeth yellow. Convince yourself that the negatives outweigh any possible positives. This is how I overcome my habits""Most people that smoke don't need convincing to know they should quit. The hardest part is giving up something that they enjoy and usually associate with social situations, such as a smoke break with work colleagues or smoking on the porch with roommates. It's a lifestyle change that few people want to give up.""Cold turkey.  

I just decided I'd had enough one day and never had another one. I didn't even set a date, didn't mark a calendar, I have no idea exactly how many days, weeks or months it's been. I believe I quit in 2002, but it could have been give or take a year.  

No patches, no programs, no hypnosis, no e-cigs (they weren't available). I think I tossed my last half a pack so there wasn't even a ""this is the last one."" I just made the decision and never looked back.  

The NYC smoking ban helped, though. I'll admit that. If everyone was still lighting up at the bar every time I went out with friends, it would have been harder to tell the cravings to take a hike. It's important to change ALL of your habits. Do something else with your breaks. Meditation. Light exercise. Go for a walk. Don't go stand out in the smoking area.""I've never been a smoker, but I knew a guy who had a really cool story about how he quit. He took the last cigarette out of his last pack, and put it in his wallet. He promised himself that if he ever smoked again, even if he was offered a cigarette, that one in his wallet would be the first he'd smoke. He said that let him see it in a new light, and he thought, ""Am I really gonna let this little cigarette beat me? Hell no!"". He hasn't smoked in around 5 years, and still has that cigarette in his wallet.

I'm sure for some people you'd want to get rid of it after a while, when you were sure you're really done smoking for good, but for him I think it was a symbol, proving that he doesn't need to avoid the temptation because he's beaten it.""I am in process of quitting cold turkey right now. Tomorrow will be a month with no cigarettes and it's by far the longest I've gotten while trying to quit. I have a lot of dreams about smoking and there are times when I would do anything for a cigarette but I have friends that refuse to give me one. I talk about it a lot and voice my need for one and that helps. 
I decided to quit because I started dating a non-smoker and I felt bad every time I had a cigarette. I think one of the biggest things was having a good reason to quit. All of my failed attempts were because I didn't have a good reason.
Quitting sucks and has made me feel like shit after 12 years of almost pack-a-day smoking. Whenever I want a cigarette I tell myself that I can start smoking again, feel even worse later, or just die. Smoking will eventually kill me. 
Cold turkey and a good support system is it. Talk about it a lot so you feel accountable if you were to have another cigarette. ""if it comes to it, wait for the inevitable bout of scary, hacking, wake-up-the-neighbors bronchitis! when i got mine this year, i hopped on the train and used the general ickiness of being ill to get through physical withdrawal (was so sick i couldn't smoke in spite of cravings). still hanging on. best of luck to ya.""""Do It For Her""""You have to want to quit. Gum helped a little but for me it was wanting to meet my grandkids some day and the resolve that no matter what I would never smoke another cigarette.  No cheat days, no bullshit lies to myself, very simple,  no cigarettes ever for the rest of my life. ""Did anyone quit smoking and have issues controlling their tempers?  

I quit for about 8 months and started again because I was too scared of myself when I was losing my temper.   I was becoming completely unhinged, and not just a week after quitting, but for 5 or 6 months afterwards.  And it wasn't just being irritable, or being grouchy,  one morning someone honked at me on my way to work and I pulled over the car and just started punching myself in the face.  I was so angry at myself for being a bad driver and a useless person.  

""My problem is that I have the willpower to not smoke at work, with company over, at a non - smokers house, etc, but if I am sitting at home having a drink and relaxing I want a smoke. I average a bit under a pack a week and I know I should quit completely. I just don't want to.

Ecigs are missing something and the gum is a joke. I don't like cigars or even the smell of cigarettes so I always smoke outside with my ""smoking jacket"" on (read: an old suede jacket that is used exclusively for smoke breaks). I have quit cold turkey for over a year a couple times but eventually I have a drink and someone has a smoke and I say screw it. If the want of a smoke ever went away it would be easier, of course, but I have the habit so tied to alcohol that I would have to stop drinking completely to stop smoking completely. I think I am just stuck with this until something in life (like having a child) makes the decision for me or a miracle drug is invented that can wash away the addiction.""If you smoke less then a pack a week and no urge unless you actually see it being smoked, i don't think you really have an addiction to them. i think it may just be a social type thing for you. 
"spite.  I quit to piss someone else off."Smoked for 5 or 6 years.  Had a pack-a-day habit for most of it. I quit cold turkey and haven't had a single puff in over 5 years now.

-Wife and I had to quit together. I couldn't have done it if she was smoking while I tried to quit. It can be cold, but if you want to quit don't be around people who smoke for the first few weeks

-We used nicotine lozenges for 7 weeks. They're one part chemical fix, one part dumbo-feather. I think they helped us.

-I'm a programmer by trade so I made a little program which ran in the task bar which would show me all sorts of stats in real-time if I moused-over it. Stuff like money saved, number of cigarettes not smoked, the amount of time I'd regained by not being outside smoking, etc. I'm certain there are likely a bajjillion phone apps which would do the same thing these days.

-DON'T SUCCUMB TO BRAIN BARGAINS. You brain starts doing that thing were it tried to figure out little loopholes and cheats. All it takes is a small crack in your resolve and everything goes downhill. It isn't going to be ok to just have one. It doesn't matter that it's your birthday or something stressful happened. If you have that one, you'll soon no longer be quitting.

I still miss it. But I don't actually care about it anymore. At a certain point, the cravings become blunt and weak and it makes you feel awesome and powerful to be able to easily shrug them off.  I still occasionally have dreams where I'm smoking and I'm get really pissed at myself for doing so. It's nice to wake up from those and you're still a non-smoker.

Good Luck."Cold turkey worked for me. I made the decision a couple of weeks before my 30th birthday and made that my quit date. I think setting the date in the near future and preparing for it really helped me make it through those first few days. Someone else in this thread suggested that you wait at least 5 minutes before giving in to a craving and then decide if you really want to give in. This was very helpful to me as well. Looking at pictures of young people withering away from cancer was also a powerful deterrent for me. This March will be my 7th anniversary cigarette-free after smoking a pack a day for about 15 years."I moved to San Francisco and had to decide between smoking and food. 


The few times before that, I  had done the cold turkey thing. It's hard, but it's the best way. Every other method is an excuse that prolongs the process. ""What worked for me? I simply told myself that I wasn't going to smoke anymore, no matter how much I wanted another cigarette, I wouldn't give in. the first week or so was excruciating and I slept a lot more than normal to help keep control of the cravings, and I was having all kinds of strange pain in my body, but after that it was a LOT easier.""Willpower. That's the only thing that works. Patches helped me, but in the end it came down to my desire to stop. 15 months smoke free here.""Talking to my (now) fiancee about getting married, traveling together, having children, etc.  

It was a revelation that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her and I realized that I wanted to be in the best shape possible, physically and mentally, so that we could enjoy our time together.""I get frowned at by people when i tell them my success story of quitting cold turkey.  I thought about for a long time and finally came to conclusion, ""Im a Dick."" Things would piss me off and i would think ""I need a cig"" when actually if i just took 5 minutes to chill i would be fine. After that I would mentally reward myself everytime i got through something irritable. So yea realizing I can be a dick and cigs are not really helping was what got me through. I smoked for 15 years mind you. Pack a day for a few of those. Still get the occasional craving but have been going strong for 4 years now. I also have better control over my anger now as a result. Good luck""Cold turkey. Anytime I tried anything with Nicotine in it to try and quit (gum, patches, cutting back, cigars, dip, etc) I would always buy a pack of smokes within a couple days.

I just finished a pack of cigarettes at the end of a day, and just didn't buy one the next day. Every time that I wanted a cigarette, I punched a wall and had a piece of fruit.

I just resigned to the fact that I was gonna be a douche for 2 weeks or so (I found the first two weeks to be the hardest part) and warned everyone around me that I had just quit.

I was working in kitchens when I quit, and so I would just step outside with the smokers and have a piece of hand fruit. I also ate a bag of sunflower seeds a day.

I now dislike the smell of smoke to the degree that it doesn't appeal to me anymore. Plus...I don't have to catch my breath when I wake up anymore :)"Becoming a father. Copenhagen Straight Cut. I hadn't had a cigarette in montghs."DMT. in a very large dose. Preferably taken orally with an MAOI. The experience from this is highly spiritual and puts you in a great position to assess not only your life but your habits. I have used this method only once. Took an oral dose with harmaline, sat on my bed and haven't smoked since. LSD can work very well for this as well. Sorry if this seems  controversial but psychedelics have a huge potential to help with addiction such as smoking. ""I was able to stop while first switching to digital cigarettes, and slowly lowering the nicotine levels, I then found how much addicted to nicotine I have been, since when I reached very low levels I didn't want to use it anymore. It took me about two months and it was almost two years ago. ""Cold turkey is the way to quit, but that only works if you really want to quit. It took about a week for me to smell and taste properly again, and a month or so for the cravings to quit. 

After that first week, you'll find yourself doing laundry or washing a jacket you don't wear often. The smell of it will be enough to hold your resolve. "/r/electronic_cigarette"I just stopped. Then again, I'm not a whiney little bitch. Nicotine has no power over you, just stop. "Not being able to afford cigarettes anymore. "If work is your trigger, then quit on vacation. Studies show quitting while breaking your routine is effective in dissociating your habit from everyday triggers like work or getting in a car. 

I started smoking in high school and started in on a pack a day in college. It was the perfect break from studying and, I thought, gave me more energy. Eventually i got sick of feeling unhealthy and decided to quit. At the same time, I went on vacation with my family. 

Some might say, why would you want to ruin a vacation with nicotine withdrawals? Indeed, I was a grouch the first day, but we were sightseeing and doing so many fun things I wasn't even thinking about it. By the time we got back I had no more physical cravings and 7 days head start on my psychological triggers. 

Now I have smoked again since then, but I never went back to that level of smoking and now I haven't bought a pack in over two years and have only smoked maybe 6 cigs in that time. 

Good luck to you. If vacation isn't an option, find ways to allow yourself to go through the withdrawal process. In the first week, let yourself eat whatever foods you want to and exercise to distract yourself from your cravings. Try to avoid your trigger activities as much as possible. 

Tell your smoking friends that you are trying to quit and to respect your decision. 

If you only get a break to smoke at work, find ways to take other breaks. Maybe you can take a short walk outside (AWAY from the smokers), or go get a treat somewhere.

One other thing I did which I think helped. Put a rubber band on your wrist. Everytime you crave a smoke, snap it as hard as you can bring yourself to do. My friend called this the ""Pavlov doggy method.""   
""One Piece. I shit you not I sat down and marathoned an anime for several days. At first it was rough, but I ended up getting so addicted to OP that it got easier. Thankfully, by the time Sanji was introduced( who is a character who pretty much constantly smokes) I was already pretty much over the habit.

 Of course, it didn't hurt I was broke as fuck and couldn't even afford cigarettes. But, it's more fun to give all the credit to One Piece.""You have to want to quit more than you want to smoke, otherwise you're never gonna make it last.

So the problem is you.

There is no secret pill for motivation.""I quit smoking almost exactly a year ago.  After I quit I went to dip.  After 3 months of dip I quit cold turkey. Haven't had nicotine in 8 months haven't had a cig in a year!
""Find something that you love more than cigarettes and understand your triggers. I smoked for 15 years and was indignant when someone suggested quitting. Then, in my early thirties I got a membership at an MMA gym. I still smoked at first but felt that I couldn't compete, I was sucking wind and a poor sparring partner. It was the most fun that I had had competing since high school sports. I also started spending more evenings at the gym which meant more exercise and less smoking and drinking. I realized that it was just more important to better myself in martial arts than to smoke. For the first time I prioritized something before cigarettes. And if  I as having a rough day (thinking about cigarettes) a noon class and several rounds of burpees quickly killed that feeling. Also, my trigger was alcohol. If I drank I would smoke...but if I drank, I couldn't make class. I just quit it all. And, after a few months, I was able to have some drinks without focusing on cigarettes. ""You have to generally want to quit, no pill, gum or whatever is going to work if you just dont want to quit.  After the final decision was made for me I went got a prescription of Chantix, took that for 1.5 months and havent had a smoke in 2 years (march this year)""A good friend of mine used to be a chain smoker.  He was the kind of smoker you could smell before you saw. He had tried to quit several times, but stress and cravings would always win out.  Last year he downloaded an app on his phone that would record the amount of money you saved and the number of cigarettes you didn't smoke.  In one week, he had saved over $100.  He's been cig free for a year.""I started running. traded one addiction for another.  882 days clear. this wasnt the first time that i tried to quit, but by far the most effective. i tried smoking less, just smoking socially, but picking up running was by far the most effective with helping me deal with going cold turkey.  ""I stopped smoking cigarettes by smoking pot instead. every time i'd want  a cig, i'd spark a bowl or a joint. I stopped smoking cigs in 2005 and haven't gone back. boom.""I smoked for almost 5 years, which is not a lot but Im only in my early 20s. I quit cold turkey and used exercise and candy to beat the cravings. I was always so used to waking up and having a cigarette and a coffee so I switched so getting up and immediately going jogging. Then for the rest of the day every time Id get a craving a pop a couple pieces of candy in my mouth. After about 3 weeks of this I wouldnt even really get cravings anymore and now I dont smoke and exercise a lot.  "[deleted]"When I was in college me and a bunch of friends all ate mushrooms, and this happened to a couple of us as well.  Granted i had only smoked for about a year.  For me it lasted over 2 years until I could drink in a bar.  For some reason I picked it up again then.  If the smoking ban law was in effect back then I may not be a smoker today.""My buddy started an e-cigarette store in New Mexico and when I mentioned I wanted to quit, he sent me about 600.00 worth of stuff so not only myself, but my girlfriend and room mate could quit too.

He also sent about 100 different strength and flavored e-liquids, which is nice.

I am currently using an eGo-Twist 900mah battery and Innokin iClear 16 Clearomizer. I use an e-liquid that is 24mg nicotine strength and in a few days I will step it down to 18mg strength and so on and so forth, until I am using lowest nicotine strength.

The hardest part for me was the ritual of smoking a cigarette. That lasted about a week and I've been pretty good since. I was having serious cravings for an actual cigarette and when I told my buddy he said, ""Well, buy a pack then. Keep using the e-cig, but if you need a cigarette, do it. Eventually you won't want cigarettes anymore"". Which I have found to be true. My room mates and I will split a pack here and there when we really crave it, but the e-liquid tastes so good it makes me not want a cig.

I'm 6 weeks in right now and have smoked for about 17 years. I am thankful for my e-cig and I think this will be the thing that helps me quit. It also really helped that my entire household quit with me as well. You can't quit when someone is still smoking around you, trust. lol.

For those interested, I got my e-cig and liquid from [Betamorph E-cigs](http://www.betamorphecigs.com). My favorite e-liquids are; Aliens Blood, Playa Papaya, Melon Ballz and Cottang. Seriously, give it a try!

Tell Deej, Adam sent you! haha""Smoked a pack a day for 3 years, quit cold turkey in the middle of the day. I still had a pack in my room. Haven't smoked a cigarette in more than two years! ""I smoked for almost ten years. For a few months before I quit I started questioning why I smoked since I noticed I didn't really enjoy it anymore, but I just did it out of pure habit (driving, after meals, breaks at works etc.). 

One day I just decided ""I am not going to have a smoke today"", to see what happened. Nothing happened. So that turned into two days, then a week, and now I don't even think about it.

My wife says she is proud of me for quitting, but really it didn't take much other than actually wanting to quit and sticking to it.

And the idea that most of my friends still smoke and having a beer would make it harder to quit had absolutely no effect on my ability to remain cigarette free. I just decided I didn't want to do it anymore, and boom, that's it.""Gender transition.

Oral estrogens carry a very small risk of deep vein thrombosis, but that risk is greatly amplified by consuming nicotine.

I wasn't worried about the far-off, remote possibility of lung cancer (especially since my family has a history of smokers living to old ages without getting cancer), but DVT was too much of a near-term risk to me, especially since I'm ordering estrogen off the Internet and not under a doctor's care (yay, lack of insurance!).

I switched to an e-cigarette when I decided to transition, and I quit nicotine entirely a little over a week before starting hormomes.""Got healthy overnight in April 2013. Quit smoking (switched to e-cig and quit that 6 months later, now I""m completely smoke and vapor free), started running, cut sugar out of my diet and started exercising. I'm still keeping it up and I couldn't be happier with myself. 

I am thankful for e-cigs, they let me feel the benefits of not smoking before I was ready to fully give up nicotine.

P.S. Down from almost 250lbs to 185lbs.""I just bought an electronic vaporizer last week and it works wonders, for those who have no real strong reason to quit. There are tons of good flavors available and you can choose the level of nicotine you want in the fluid. It's a good start, since vapor isn't harmful to your lungs. I've been using it for a week and I have barely wanted to smoke at all, after being a pack a day smoker. I feel overall healthier, get less winded walking up stairs already, etc. I'd highly recommend it to anyone trying to quit smoking. ""Vaping ! Actually Vaping not E-Cigs. See Link Below:

http://ssvape.com/""I just use e-cigs now. I enjoy using them, and since they're a hell of a lot cheaper and no 4000 chemicals that can mess up your health, I have no intention of quitting it.""Smoked for 10 years. Switched to [snus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus) and managed to quit almost immediately.

Two years later I quit snus, and I've been free of the stuff since around christmas 2011""Started smoking at around 21, after I had already smoked weed for over three years with no asthmatic reactions. Within a month found myself in the hospital due to asthma twice. Redneck logic told me it was the filters. I began smoking Camel non filtered. Worked like a charm. However after about four years new wife did not like smoking. 
Went to dipping for about 3 years, then the 'green smoke' brand of electronic cigarette. 
I'm now three years removed from all forms of nicotine. 
The biggest factor (for getting off the real cigarettes) was being grossed out by the way my breath tasted in the morning. The wife likes to hear it was her. LoL
The biggest factor in getting off all forms of nicotine in General was I began working out. Building muscle and nicotine do not go together.""Cold turkey. Because I realized that smoking came down to a simple yes or no choice. Should I buy smokes? No. Do I need to smoke when I drink? No, although this is a lot easier said than done. Do I want my lungs to heal? Yes.

It's all a choice, you don't have to make the wrong one.""I don't have kids; but after my wife and I got married and were talking about kids, I started to realize that I wanted to spend as much time with her and my future children as I possibly could. I want my kids' kids to be able to remember their grandpa and actually know me as they grow up. ""I wanted to start boxing, lose weight and be healthier. I knew that I couldn't do that and still smoke. The patches were a godsend along with my drive to finally be healthier. I haven't picked up a cigarette since July 2, 2011."you just need a better electric cigarette. the ones from the gas station are garbage. I'll be one year cigarette free in march"Totally this, I quit last february with an eGo which is by no means the best or worst, but once you find one that gives you what you need it's Game Over for smoking.  18 days away from a year without smoking and couldn't be happier.""I quit when I was sick for 2 straight weeks. Didn't feel like smoking when I was sick and decided not to start again when I was feeling better. If you are *ahem* ""lucky"" enough to be that sick for that long, take advantage of it!""I traded cigarettes for E-cigarettes a year ago. I started at a fairly high concentration of nicotine, and slowly removed nicotine as time progressed. I still carry an E-cig, but now there's no nicotine in it, and in general, I only take a drag once or twice a day. YMMV, of course."Got a bj for every cig i skipped"You need a mental click in your brain that makes you realize just how stupid and foolish it is to smoke and then you go cold turkey.

But it took a while for me to get that click.
It so easy to convince yourself that cigarettes aren't that bad.""After smoking for 20 years I was able to stop by doing a few things.  

First I did not use the word ""quit"", from the time we are little out parents told us ""don't be a quitter"", so now you tell your brain that being a quitter for this is OK.  Your brain says, no way I'm not a quitter.  Use the word stop and stopped.  It's OK for your brain to stop anything.

Next I drank a whole lot of water.  I mean a WHOLE LOT.  It really helps to flush your system of the toxins and you will be too busy running to the toilet to reach for a cigarette.

Finally I had worked hard at mental imaging.  Picture in your brain what you look like, if that picture has a cigarette in your hand or mouth work hard at changing it.  Tell yourself that only you can change that picture and that it will look better without that cigarette.  

The best to you and anyone that wants to stop smoking.  There is no luck involved, there is no trying involved, only doing it.  Change the picture in your head, use the right verbiage and drink a WHOLE  LOT of water.  

This worked for me.""Lots of folks responding they quit smoking by switching to e-cigs. Not sure a change in nicotine delivery really qualifies as a quit. 

Me, I had success with the drug Chantix. Made smoking a cigarette about as enjoyable as smoking a carrot. 

I had to learn new habits... Going for a walk to think instead of just stepping outside for a smoke. New ""before bed"" and ""after dinner"" rituals. Elected to no longer go to bars that allowed smoking. 

Been a non smoker five years. Can't imagine letting cigarettes own me again. "Don't know if this is what your looking for but E-cigs worked for me. You can start downgrading nicotine levels until you are completely off of it."Mentally I am unable to quit. My brain will come up with excuses to smoke, and smoke NOW. I'm smoking right now. I smoke when I wake up because I need it. I smoke when I drink coffee. I smoke when I drive. I smoke after every meal. It's like that commercial where the dude puts his pants on backwards because he's so used to smoking. My brain explodes without smoking. I get angry. I throw my pack away, have my girlfriend hide it, then I go buy another pack. Cold turkey makes me bed ridden and feel sick, then the thought of a cigarette cures me. Then I think about it more, and go smoke. A pack a day, everyday. I can't breathe. I don't have health insurance. I use inhalers. Can't work because of the cold weather, no money. Girlfriend buys me cigarettes. I get angry at her. She stops buying me cigarettes. I get angry at her again. She gives me money for cigarettes. Can't pay rent. Can't pay phone bill. Will be homeless, and all I can think about is I must have cigarettes. I've taken pills and tried the gum.

Once you find the right one with the right juice you'll love it. Yes, it's heavy, it looks funny, people call it a dildo, it's going to take some getting used to.

This book teaches you to think about quitting in a completely different way.  He doesn't say anything that hasn't been said before but lays it out in a great way.  I actually heard about the book by browsing a similar reddit topic.  The book is free for download.  Definitely check it out if you serious about quitting!

During this time you literally can't smoke. This way you get a jump on the physical addiction. Then after the cold never smoke again. That's what I did."There's no tricks, secret formulas, or special techniques that are going to help you.

*If you're going to quit smoking, you have to want to quit.* Know why you're quitting, and remind yourself every time you feel the urge to light up. The only thing that will get you through this is the desire to stop and the willpower to do so. You have it in you. You just need to use it.

I'll be a year free in March. It's not easy, but it gets easier. I won't say good luck, because luck won't help you. Only you can help you. ""I started with snus instead, at least healthier and doesn't smell. But if I wanna kick that (and coffee) i guess meth would be the next logical step :/""I was at Marley fest and we had been smoking another herb all day, to the point that my body was saturated with a strange, uneasy feeling(paranoia, maybe just too much smoke/ash in my system). I thought smoking one would calm me down(I was previously a fairly regular smoker) but it sent me into an anxiety attack. I've always had anxiety issues and Nicotine always had a feel-good-but-underlying-bad-feeling given to me. One day my body just wouldn't take it and sent me into an anxious mode for 20 minutes until my friends found me.

I never want to feel like that again. Since then I only smoked one when my friend and I got super drunk, got in a bicker, and racked my nerves. We shared one and have only had one since April. ""Partially it was the realization that I used cigarettes to draw a line around myself that I didn't want people to cross.  It gave me an excuse to duck out of any situation.  For example, if someone was in my personal space I would light a cigarette to step back a bit so as not to blow smoke on them.  

I decided to learn how to have my boundaries respected in a more healthy and direct way.  

I also realized I didn't picture myself as a smoker in 5 years, but I could have said the same thing 5 years before that.  Every cigarette after that was a reason why I wasn't becoming the person I wanted to be.

Does your excuse make sense to you?  Stand up for your right to have occasional breaks.""I'm a serial quitter, I've done this too often to remember. The best way so far has been a combination of Zyban and hookah. Start with Zyban, after a while you can't finish a cigarette it just tastes and feels horrible. Once you've quit and finished the course of Zyban you can smoke the hookah every now and then. It's still smoking but it's far less often and easier to quit, also is a whole lot more inconvenient. Zyban took away my cravings which would normally make me an unpleasant person to be around. Read Allen Carr's book, very insightful and helps with the motivational bit as well. Good luck!""I smoked for almost five years. I picked up the habit after a nasty breakup, and the nicotine did seem to help me calm down and de-stress. Over time my habit grew from a few cigarettes a day to a pack a day. I tried ""quitting"" several times, but that only lasted until I passed the gas station on my way to work. 
I tried the electronic cigarettes, which seemed to work until I ate a nice meal and then I *had* to have one. And let's not forget the ""I'm getting in my car so I have to have one"". 
My mother had a stroke at the age of 41, the Dr said it was due to her smoking, which was over a pack a day. This was three years ago. She uses her electronic cigarette and hasn't smoked since. 
My mother and I decided to quit together, which lasted until I was out of her sight. 
What finally got me to quit was my wife. She told me that she didn't want our children growing up without a father. 

Tldr; smoked for a while, wife finally got me to quit. 
"Started smoking marijuana. A fat sack of weed"I was a smoker for 16 years. Pack a day when I could afford. I went cold turkey. 

How I did it was create something that outweighed the nicotine rush. You need somebody who you trust, somebody who you really cannot and would not lie to. 

Then together go into the supermarket and pick up a can of cat food. Something with liver, something small. 

Then make a pledge, an honest pledge. 
Smoke once and eat the can with only a fork, no heating or adding flavor. This must be done within 12 hours of the ""inhale"". You should video this and send it to your friend. 

I would say that this pledge should only be for 6 months. After that do another or not. 

It works only if it a true pledge. No weaseling out of it. No excuse. Accept the punishment. 

Now, is that one rush worth a can of cat food?""Just learn to vape, hard. Get into mechanical mods and RDA's and blow HUGE clouds. It tastes great and is a ton of fun.

""Ecigs, made it easy to lower nicotine dosages until i was smoking non nicotine, just using it now when i get a strog urge to smoke and it satisfiea that crave and keeps me from using the real stuff, its a good way to move away from it slowly if you have a hard time quitting cold turkey""It's been 21 days since I've smoked a cigarette, which is the longest I've gone in almost 20 years of smoking.  I've tried quitting in the past and always failed miserably within a couple days if not hours.  My job is also a huge trigger.  This time I did a couple things differently that I think have had a big impact on the success I've seen so far.

My advice, ditch the e-cig.  If you want to do nicotine replacement go with patches and gum.  The real insidiousness of smoking is the ritualistic aspect of it.  So many day to day activities end up getting associated with smoking in our brains, things like waking up in the morning, or eating, or drinking coffee.  I think to have any real success you have to break those patterns and an e-cig is too similar to the real thing.  You hold it the same, the delivery system is the same.  It doesn't do anything to beak any of the established smoking patterns and if anything reinforces them.  With patches and gum you can keep your nicotine levels stable enough to mitigate most cravings and you're not perpetuating the smoking rituals.

[Don't tell anyone you're quitting](http://lifehacker.com/5921478/shhh-keeping-quiet-may-help-you-achieve-your-goals).  Seriously.  Pick one or two people to be your support system and only tell them.  I still haven't even told my mother yet and the only thing I could tell her that would make her any happier would be an announcement that she's going to be a grandmother.

Don't make a big deal out of it.  By that I mean don't tie quitting to any kind of anniversary, or birthday, or any significant date.  Think about how many people succeed with New Years Resolutions and avoid that mentality.  Make it low key in your mind.  Don't think about how you can never smoke again forever, break it down to minutes if you have to.  

When my patches showed up in my mailbox ([thanks Quit Line](https://www.quitnow.net)) I put one on and told myself I'd just see how it goes.  I was a total wreck and the very next day went out and bought some 4mg nicotine gum to supplement the patch but I stayed focused on the present and I didn't break.  It does get easier.

If you're going to use gum chew it on a schedule.  Don't wait for a craving because you're just reinforcing the habit that way.  Do some push-ups, or walk around the block instead when you get a tough craving.  It's all about creating new patterns.

7 days ago I ran out of patches.  I considered buying more and stepping them down (was using 21mg) but thought I'd try a day on gum only and evaluate from there.  That first day sucked (not as bad as the first day on the patch, but tough nonetheless) but again I stayed focused on the present and I've since stuck with just the gum.  You can do it."asthma "Allen Carrs easy way to quit smoking, took 3 days to read and once I finished I never smoked again.  Not even once. I quit Sept 22nd 2005 and haven't looked back.

No bollocks, best thing ever.""No one will ever see this, but I must share bc I've never met anyone else who used this method.

Smoked for 12 years (16-28).  I was a pack a day smoker, which would go up to three packs if I was out drinking.  I would smoke the last thing before I slept and before I did anything else in the morning.  Oh, and sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night to smoke.  I Was having racing heart, so I went to a cardiologist.  He told me I was using too much caffeine, nicotine, and that I needed to quit smoking.  My mom had smoked my entire childhood, and kept smoking through her MS diagnosis, multiple bouts of bronchitus, and brain aneurism.  I myself had smoked through bronchitus.  I knew I needed to stop, but had failed multiple times after initial success with the patch, so I took the doc's advice on how to do it.

Every other day, I would smoke one less cigarette.  So day one, I had 20, day three I had 19, until I eventually got down to zero.  The value of this method is that I avoided withdrawal, and was hyper-conscious of every cigarette.  I became aware of how I used cigs to treat myself, to address boredom, to console myself, and for any other imaginable reason.  I also came to see that it really did none of those things.  The best thing it did for me was give me a chance to take a break sometimes.  Something I could do anyway without the smoke.

Also, the difficulty of quitting (both psychologically, and the drawn-out process) made me never want to go through it again.  I think that's the problem with the patch.  Too easy.  If you go through the torment of quitting, you remember it and never want to have to face it again!

Eight years later, and I'm still a nonsmoker.

TL/DR: Smoke one less cigarette every day until you get to zero.
"[This guy!](http://imgur.com/4bhPeaD)"After ten years and dozens of failed attempts at quitting, this system finally worked:

1. Add up all your vices, crutches, or things you otherwise get quick satisfaction from; tobacco, alcohol, coffee, weed, sugar, twitter, whatever.

2. quit all of them at once, for a solid 5 days.

3. lose your shit. have your ego fall apart, have 12 hour long panic attacks, migranes, etc.

4. (optional) on the 6th day, climb a mountain.

5. on the 7th day, bring back all your other vices except cigarettes, and start using an e-cig.

6. over the next few weeks to months, realize that e-cigs are lame and take all the fun out of actually smoking, and finally get off niccotine all together.

If you truly WANT to quit, its not that hard. Whatever you do, don't try the nicotine gum. People get hooked on that worse than cigarettes.""Well, my wife and I basically decided one day we weren't going to buy another pack. It's been about 3 months for me since.

When I first bought my e-cig I would smoke it while playing video games, doing homework, literally everywhere and at all times. This made me rely on nicotine even more and was also expensive

So, buy an electronic cigarette, but keep your same smoking patterns by only having ""e-cig breaks"". Another fun thing that helped was downloading an app that gave me updates on how my health is improving and how much money I am saving.

I see that you picked up real ones again anyway, but it all comes down to self control. Avoid going in to gas stations too, for me that is when I would always pick up a pack, but if I just stayed outside to pay for my gas with a credit card I didn't have the opportunity to go in and buy more of the real cigs. Now I don't touch the real ones and I just puff on light nicotine menthol e-liquid in my car, on the computer at home, on the computer at work, etc. The e-cig really is awesome imho."For me it was just looking at how much I spent on cigarettes every week .

but that aside, i started watching breaking bad last summer shortly after i started vaping, and that made me feel so shitty for smoking. yes, i know walter wasn't a smoker, but still seeing that and imagining me as him and going through that with my family, reassured me that i made the right decision by vaping.

The other thing I did too was instead of taking a 5 minute smoke break, I took a 5 minute walk.  Just set the timer on your phone for 2.5 minutes and walk somewhere.

Apparently they both bind to the same receptors. And it's cheap - a 240 count of 500mg tablets is available from GNC for $18.99 - I guess this is one of the reasons that the doctors and pharmaceutical companies don't push it because they can't make a big markup on it like they do with Nicorette and the patch.

One thing to be careful of is that you need to follow a regimen of starting with a 100mg tablet after each meal for 2 weeks, upping the dosage by 100mg per two weeks until you can switch to the 500mg tablets.

Also, **DO NOT** get the time release type of niacin, as taking it at that level can be stressful for the liver, but if you gradually build up to the right level using the non-time release ones, it isn't a problem.

I had smoked for 16 years and quit right away after getting started with niacin. Then all I needed to do was find something to replace the ritual. I started eating sunflower seeds, which give me something to do with my hands and mouth, and contain health benefits of their own. There are even different flavor ones and low-sodium/low salt versions. YMMV.

That might seem like a dickhead answer but it is the truth. It is also how I quit.

Around 12 years ago my father had major heart surgery and during the prep the doctor told him that he wouldn't be having that surgery if he didn't smoke. He later died from stage 4 lung cancer, obviously smoking exacerbated that situation. After the surgery (a couple years before the death) I decided that I needed to stop before I was in the same situation. 

The next day at work I was having a smoke, stopped, handed the rest of my cigarettes away to another smoker and I haven't bought any since. When I first quit I was very pissy but your addiction to cigarettes is easily overcome by just suffering for a couple weeks while the worst of it passes. 

No gimmick is going to help unless you embrace the mental aspect of quitting. When you think you NEED a cigarette, you don't.

I wish you the best of luck in your quest. I promise you that you will feel better than you have in a long time once you finally stop but doing so is completely about your own willpower.""What helped me quit was changing my lifestyle as a whole. I began dieting and working out at the same time. I also rewarded myself by buying myself a PSP at the time so on my breaks at work I wouldn't go outside.

 "I smoked an entire pack as fast as I could. Now just thinking of cigs makes me sick to my stomach."I've been cigarette free since September 4th 2012. The weekend before was the last of my summer vacation and I went up to see my best friend who was 2 years younger than me, I was 20 at the time, and was into his freshman year at Berkeley. 
         I was at a community college at the time, living at home, and my parents had finally given up on trying to get me to quit. So naturally I had the availability to smoke as much as I wanted, whenever I wanted, wherever I wanted. This kinda took the excitement out of it. Smoking a pack a day for 4 years at that point in time (I had started in high school). So with the excitement gone, I kinda just felt shitty smoking. Woke up every morning with a heavy chest full of phlegm. Couldn't do some of my favorite activities like play basketball and pretty much any physical activity without feeling like I was about to shit my lungs out. 
         With that I also saw my friends condition in Berkeley. He was on his own, two years younger than me getting an education in one of the best schools in the country while I was, at the time, living on my own struggling to get out of community college and start my life. 
         So at 11:48 pm of September 3 I puffed on my last stogie. I started working out, I started taking my school work very seriously, I started playing basketball. I organized my day in a disciplined manner and that semester for the very first Time I got finished with straight As. 
        But the biggest change was the mental aspect of it. I was always happy. You know that feeling when you get angry for whatever reason and calm yourself down with a cigarette? You don't need to do that anymore because you're just always happy. The sun hits your skin, happy. You wake up, happy. You eat, happy. The greatest decision I EVER made was quitting. No patches, no nicotine gum. Quit cold turkey and anytime I needed to smoke, I'd chew on some trident or pop tic tacs. ""I quit after watching my mom die of lung cancer. I know that doesn't help other people quit but think about how many people you know who have or have had cancer. It is super prevalent and it is an awful, dehumanizing way to die.

My outlook is this: If you completely negate tobacco right away, your doomed to fail. Also, having a good E-Cig helps alot too. Using the E-Cig I have now, I started by using both. While using both on and off, I gradually worked away from actual cigarettes to solely using the E-Cig. 

There's really alot more to it though. The liquids you use need to be dependable and to your liking. If you have an e liquid that you THINK you like, find one you DO like. I stayed away from tobacco flavors in favor of the fruit/drink flavors which I think greatly helped me move on. 

The liquids also have a strength factor to them called PG and VG. certain percentages of each can determine the strength of each ""hit"" and can help you move on from the tabacco too. For example, I smoked lights, so 50/50 or 60PG/40VG was as close as I came to simulating the light feeling. If you smoke regulars or methol, you may want to use higher VG for the better ""throat hit"".

Nicotine levels are of course important too. If you buy a E-Cig from a local gas station or wherever, they typically have 12mg per E-Cig which simulates the NIC levels of someone who smokes less than a pack a day. For myself, I smoke AT LEAST a pack a day and found 18MG nicotine fit perfectly. 

I know this is alot of info, and maybe you already know, but it can work with 50% being the equipment/Nicotine juice and the other 50% your own efforts. 2 of my favorite sites are www.myfreedomsmokes.com for the equipment and www.mtbakervapor.com for the juices. 

Feel free to PM me for any other info.""Electronic cigarettes. Pick one up, don't get one of the disposables, spend however much you would on cigs to buy a cool one, get some tasty liquid, making it a committed hobby is what did it for me I think. Check out r/electronic_cigarettes, awesome community that will help you a lot. Good luck, it's a tough habit to kick but it's a great feeling when you do. ""I don't know if you really kicked the habit, since you are still addicted to nicotine. ""This will probably get buried.

My dad got really bad pneumonia when I was 5 and ended up quitting cold turkey.

My mom had to go to the hospital while I was away at school this past year and they were worried something was up with her heart. She finally decided to quit after years of my giving her shit (and her making false promises to my dad such as, ""Oh, if we get a dog, I'll quit!"" - that was when I was 7, she barely made attempts, but various shitty things happened since then and I'm sure with all the stress she had she couldn't yet). She started using e-cigarettes a few years ago before they became ubiquitous in convenience stores and still costed $100+. But as of this month she has gone 9 months without smoking thanks to e-cigarettes.  She started gradually reducing the nicotine level. I'm proud of her. :)""Two things - First was the motivation.  I knew ± should do it for me, my health, the smell on my clothes, etc. But I needed a goal. So I promised my daughter last Valentine's day that I would quit before her fifth birthday in August. A gift for both of us. And I don't break promises to my daughter.

Second was the tool to my success. The electronic cigarette.  Not the crappy get it at the gas station kind (looking at you blu), but a good quality e-liquid vaporizer.   I purchased a kit from an exceptionally helpful local vapor shop.  Two tanks, two batteries, charger, enough heating elements to last a couple months.  With this kit I could use two flavors. One reminiscent of the brand I smoked, one just mint (± like mint).  That way I could ween myself off the tobacco taste, as well as the nicotine.  I was also able to have the vapor shop prepare the e liquid in diminishing strengths to gradually reduce my dependence there as well.  Started at 12mg/ml and dropped the dose by 2mg/ml each time I needed more liquid.  I was off cigarettes within 2 weeks and 8 months later don't vape anymore either.  Gave my kit away to a friend who expressed interest in quitting in hopes they have success with it too.

TL/DR - Make a promise to someone you don't want to disappoint. High quality E-cigs/Vaporizers really do work.

edit - a word""E-Cigs. More importantly, hating the way I felt like I had to have them to go about my day. If I forget my e-cig I don't feel like something is missing from my day like I did with cigarettes.

I haven't had a cigarette in almost a year. "Get a high quality e-cig and very high nicotine level liquid. Then just slowly start to replace 1 or 2 normal cigarettes per day with your e-cig. In no time your body will learn that the e-cig is just as good as the real thing. Then you can slowly reduce nicotine levels."Vaping! I haven't had a cigarette in 3 years. There are definitely pros and cons though, the cons being that I vape a whole lot more than I used to smoke. I did the math and I vape the nicotine equivalent of about 60 cigarettes a day. But I can also run 5 miles without feeling like I'm going to die, so whose really counting nicotine milliliters anyway?""The thing with me is that I absolutely love smoking, yet I wanted to quit so badly. 
I ended up getting an e-cig with a tank that you fill with liquid and a wick that soaks it up. It actually gives me that sensation of smoking with a strong throat hit and huge vapor production, so I still feel like I'm getting my smoking in, just sans the carcinogens. 
It might be correcting error with error, but I haven't had a cigarette in about 6 months and I feel great, so I'm not complaining. 
I tried to initially quit using e-cigs like Blu, but I always ended up going back to cigarettes within a couple of weeks because they just don't give you the right feeling. 
Spend some money on a good e-cig that has a wick if you want to keep your habit without worrying about cancer every time you take a puff. 
Also, visit [r/electronic_cigarette](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/) if you're interested in them. ""If you have an ecig and you're smoking real ones, try a higher nicotine content. For real, don't try to quit on like a 1.6 dose. Get at least a 2.4""e-cigs. started with a lightweight one meant to emulate the look and feel of a real cigarette, and eventually my collector's compulsion, techie mind, and just getting used to it not being ""real"" led me to put together fancier setups. still very addicted to nicotine but fuck it, i'm not getting cancer from it and i have low blood pressure anyway.""I started smoking my best friend's mother's cigarettes when I was 8, by the time I was in high school I was smoking a pack a day. I tried to quit dozens of times, often for periods of up to a year. When I turned 30 I was hospitalized with Pneumonia. It was a very bad case, with IV antibiotics, and that was when I first realized lung disease was no joke. It's not like having a broken bone where you can just ""rest it"", you have to keep breathing 24x7. It hurt, excruciatingly. The worst was trying to sleep and waking in pain having to lift my body to roll over, the sudden exertion and laying on one side felt like a sword piercing through my side. Hiccups, burps, farts sent me through the roof with pain. Those sudden involuntary contractions hurt more than all the others and I had no control over them.
After two weeks in the hospital I was released and  I immediately bought a pack of smokes. I carried them around in my shirt pocket, telling myself to wait. I made up these artificial deadlines, some even just a few seconds long. Every time I wanted a cigarette, I would postpone it until the next  ""deadline"". I was walking to school and I wanted a smoke, so I'd say, OK, but you have to wait until you get to 57th St., if you still want one when you get there, have one. In the five minutes it took to walk to 57th st. the desire had subsided. Eventually it was, wait until dinner, or wait until tomorrow morning, but having the pack nearby gave me a sense of security.
After a month post hospital, without smoking, I tossed the pack I had bought into the nearest bin. That was 25 years ago. Lung disease is no joke, but they don't tell you how painful it is, 24x7. You can't get away from the pain. The sooner you quit, the better. Hate the bastards that manipulated your immature sense of self and lack of self confidence, selling you cigarettes to make you think you look cool, only to hook you on nicotine. Don't pine for it, but hate it and all the motherfuckers who sell it, and other losers who continue to smoke, stay away.""The first time I quit, I was 17. I'd been smoking for a year at two or three singles a day. I got in the car one morning, put a cigarette in my mouth, started to light it, and thought, ""What the fuck am I doing? This is fucking disgusting!"" I threw the cigarette out the window and threw the pack away when I got to school. A year later, I got into college and the stress got to me. I got up to two packs a day for another year. Then about a year and I half ago I started talking to this girl that I really liked. She told me how her dad died of lung cancer and would never date a smoker because she didn't want to go through that again. Understandable. She texted me and asked if I smoked. I looked at the lit cigarette in my hand decided finding out if this girl was worth it was better than slowly killing myself. I ground the half a cigarette out and texted her back to tell her I was quitting. I had my last cigarette a couple of days later. She and I then started dating and are still together. I haven't had a cigarette in almost a year and a half. Though there are times I feel like I could commit murder for a cigarette, I can generally keep my cravings under control with the aid of an ecig.

TLDR: I quit because my now-SO wouldn't date a smoker. I manage cravings with an ecig."Copenhagen. Straight cut. I stopped smoking.  It's the only way to stop smoking."The thought that every cigarette I buy makes those evil motherfuckers who own the companies richer. Every cigarette I smoke, they win.

It was the best motivation I've ever had.""By actually 100% hating cigarettes, spending money on them, and how they made my body feel. Also they raised the price 2 bucks a pack this summer to raise money for the Vikings new stadium, and I hate them so much I decided I'd rather quit right then and there than give the Vikings any of my money. Its been about 8 months now, no regrets. "I got tired of having palpitations every time i smoked"I asked the most beautiful girl I knew at the time, to logically talk me out of it, giving reasons. 
I highly recommend this.""I ran out of cigarettes, didn't want to buy more, said ""fuck it"" and quit. 

To be fair, I kept smoking the occasional pipe and cigar, but sooner or later said ""fuck it"" to that too and decided to spend my money elsewhere, like a motorcycle. Much more enjoyable way to slowly inch my way closer to death."Willpower.Vaping. I have several friends that went from packs a day to nothing once they started vaping. It's worth a shot and doesn't require you to give up on nicotine immediately."I tried every aid out there to help me quit.   Ultimately it was cold turkey, being proud of how far I got and posting to reddit's quit smoking subreddit whenever I struggled.   I think I quit because I decided I needed to seperate myself from the smokers and hang out with people trying to quit."I found it was interfering with my workouts and triathlon training.  When I realized that I quite cold turkey.  Something clicks inside which makes you really want to quit.  You always want to stop but never enough to put up with the pain of quitting.  Once you want to quit more then the struggle of quitting you will.  I should add that it was a horrible experience for me.  I couldn't sleep for 3 days I went from sweats to the chills all night it sucked and I still miss it."My partner telling me they wanted me to be alive to see my children grow up. Three months of patches later, and I was off. Don't get me wrong, I still occasionally crave one like crazy, but you need to want it in the first place, otherwise it won't happen.""Ex-smoker. Smoked from the age of 14 until around 32. 

Gave up twice actually. When I was 19 I gave up smoking for two years, until I was 21. Took it up again because I am an idiot. 

Currently smoke free for 2.5 years. 

Patches, e-cigs, gum...Do not work. They all have nicotine in them, and that is what you are addicted to. 

The best, and only way that you are going to give up smoking is to stop putting cigarettes in your mouth.

There is some good advice in this thread. But really, you have to want it, you have to set it up (e.g., set a day, prepare things to do rather than smoke), and for me personally, put away some time to get through the withdrawal period. 

You are at work, I can appreciate that it is difficult to quit smoking. I faced the same problem. Take three or four days off and lock yourself up at home. Change your schedule. Wake up and go for a walk rather than smoke on those days. Move about. Give yourself time to get over those cravings and without stress. I played Skyrim when I gave up. It gave me an excuse to lock myself up and to have something to do with my hands. 

After three days, the nicotine is out of your system, and the only thing stopping you from continuing to quit, is being able to say to yourself, and to others, ""No, I do not want a smoke"". Do it regularly enough, and you will find that you stop thinking about it, and then you will be a non-smoker. 

Good luck!""I think you have to be ready to quit.  For me, just saying I wanted to quit wasnt enough.  I wasnt ready to quit, cause I still enjoyed it for numerous reasons.  At a certain point, I said I'd had enough, and that was that.  Never smoked again.

Will can go a long way when you want something enough.

It's been nearly 5 months since I ingested nicotine...I never thought a book could help with a decade long, pack-a-day habit, but sure enough.""I don't smoke but my psychology teacher has used this to help people stop smoking. You write down all the times you smoke, buy a pack of cigarettes that you don't like, and smoke anytime during the day except the times that you wrote down. A woman in my class was able to quit smoking this way. ""E-Cigs! I started slowly phasing out cigarette smoking while at the same time introducing E-Cigs (w/ nicotine). Eventually there was a half-way point where I used cigarettes half the time and E-cigs the other half when wanting to smoke (lets say consume nicotine at this point). Eventually I completely phased out cigarettes (although I still had cravings for a cigarette after meals and when drinking alcohol) and would just puff on an E-cig to get that nicotine fix my brain and body were craving for. From this point I was using medium-nicotine and switched to low-nicotine, then to no-nicotine liquids. Then one day I just didn't feel like puffing anymore. 

This took a total of 6 months and I have been nicotine free for the past 4 months. I highly recommend one starts exercising during this time for 3 reasons: 1 is endorphins; 2 is so you can really feel how terrible your breathing is when you're smoking and exercising (and to also note the improvement over time); 3 is you may start to notice weight gain once you stop smoking. 

It's a really tough habit and addiction to kill. I'm 24 years old and spent last year volunteering as a medic overseas. After seeing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), I knew I had to stop. I always thought this stuff would never happen to me and up until I was immersed in the treatment of people (regular people like you and me) suffering from smoking-induced illnesses did I connect the dots and decided to quit. Since that point, I decided I want to be the best I can be, mentally and physically. So I prepared myself for a lifestyle-paradigm shift. I exercise multiple times a week, I'm studying to become a doctor, I'm taking responsibility for my body and my actions. And recently I've begun no-fap. As a 24-year-old, I feel that biological development has brought me to the peak of my growth, and at this stage in life, it's up to me, my actions/decisions, to keep myself developing upward. Because from this point on, if you do not input energy into that upward curve that is you're early life, the curve will start going downhill.

TLDR: Be the best you can be. Nicotine is the most highly psycho-addictive drug known to man and quitting will be hard. It will take much energy, discipline, and will power to overcome this hurdle and with perseverance YOU CAN DO IT!

I'm hooked on them but better than the smoke, tar, and stank from real cigarettes"I had always had no desire to smoke when I was sick. In march last year I had a horrible sinus infection and just couldn't smoke. I took it as a chance to quit because I had no physical desire I only had to get over the habit of having extra breaks at work. I have had only 1 cigarette since last march 15th. To be honest at least once a day I crave one."E-Cigs.  Sure, its is replacing one bad habit with another... but I'm finally at a place where I don't want to vape nearly as much as I used to smoke.  My e-juice is 3% nicotine.  My next order has no nic in the juice at all... because the desire isn't there.  It took about a year to kick the habit, but it was easy.  I never craved a cigarette and weaned myself off nicotine gradually.  

It wasn't embarrassing either.  I was primarily a car-smoker.  When I opened my front doors, the smell wafting out was like a dirty ashtray.  No one was allowed to be a passenger because I didn't want my coworkers to know I smoked.  Now, I get comments that the car smells amazing - like butter pecan or cake batter.  All due to my e-cig.""Just get it in your head that you have quit, not that you're quiting. It's all about will power. Just stop. Worked for me anyway."E cig! Then cut the nicotine on that until zero. Worked for me too! Cigarette free for a over a year but still use the e-cig on low nic level. "I started dipping more.

""I smoked a pack a day for 12 years. I had tried to quit for my wife several times with no luck. I did not want to quit but only tried for her sake. I was on the back porch smoking due to having children in the house. My five year old son came outside and told me "" Dad, when I grow up I am going to be just like you and smoke cigarettes"". I told him that smoking was bad and that is not a good thing to look forward to. I promised him that I was done smoking. That was my last cigarette. I quit cold turkey, because I truly wanted to quit.
I tell everyone that until they want to quit that it is a losing battle.""*Throwaway account from a Cigarette addict for many years.*

I wanted so badly to quit but the addiction was too strong. How bad was it? It was so bad, I'd buy a pack of cigarettes, smoke a 1/4th of one, and then start crying and throw the pack out; I was so angry with myself that I couldn't stop myself. 

What actually worked for me? LSD.

LSD makes you experience everything like it was the first time you did it.

I tried it one time with some friends and it was an incredible experience. During the trip, I saw my cigarettes and decided to smoke one...it was the most disgusting thing I'd ever had in my life.

That experience really stuck with me (I'm not sure if it rewired my brain or what). Ever since then, I've never smoked another cigarette and the thought of smoking one grosses me out.

I read Allen Carr's easy way to quit smoking, quit for like 6 months, and started smoking again. I kept putting off quitting until I finished the book again. then I realized, it's so fucking stupid, the only thing I need is myself, and if I really DO want to quit, I should.

I hated everything about it though. the smell I had. the need to constantly smoke. the money. 

There was about 7 hours of anxiety after quitting, but after that passed I never looked back. I did, however, have 3 weeks of spontaneous anger for no reason after quitting.

Summary: If you want to quit, quit right the fuck now. Sure, you're scared. You're physically addicted! But you don't need it. Any positive attribution you have towards it is warped. Just remember it's causing you those pangs. It's causing the need to smoke. The cigarettes only prolong this feeling. You'll quit eventually, might as well quit now.

What finally got me to quit is my SO getting pregnant. I've always wanted to be a father, and at 33 it was finally gonna happen!

I'm actually pretty surprised I've gotten as far as I have. Esp with how stressful my job is. I do have a cigarette here and there, maybe once or twice a week. Even then, I normally don't finish a full one. And my cravings have cut way down. You have to be self disciplined.  Give it two weeks on the alt smoke vaporizer. Cigarettes will eventually taste disgusting, and you won't care to smoke them.

Good luck. Its definitely not an easy thing to accomplish, in my experience.""I tried quitting a thousand times (a quote I think by Mark Twain). It was true for me. To quit I did it gradually, I started with a pack a day and worked down to a pack a week. This took about 6 months. Then I got it down to a cigarette a day, usually in the morning. Then when I read an article that described why it was so hard to quit I got motivated to run. If I remember the article it was something about how the tar hangs onto your lungs and sits there for a long time. So I thought what if I started running. I started walking at first and took the nicotine patches and put them on and then when I became reliant on them I started cutting them in half and then I was finally able to never touch another cigarette, I've been away from them since 2009. I've ran 1 half marathon and about 20 5 and 10 k runs. I'm healthier now than when I was 30 (I'm 50). You can quit but you have to WANT to quit. Stay away from people who smoke and places where they allow smoke. If you drink caffeine you may have to wing yourself off of this as it sends similar cravings to your brain. Good Luck!!!""sounds like you need a new relaxing social habit for work, beef jerky or jolly ranchers would give ya something to do, spits are good too if you can get outside now and then, looking at sexy pictures now and then helps to alleviate stress and just keep reminding yourself how incredible your going to feel once the first few days are done, the cravings never truly stop but they do become easier every day and one day you'll break down and have one in six months and damn near puke, then your officially done""Booze.  Seriously.  I gave up smoking because it started to get too damn expensive and I found drinking to be a preferable, and cheaper, vice.  

The kicker is that I still socially smoke, but only once every blue moon with purple stars.""I micro-dosed with magic mushrooms twice a week for around a month and it completely got rid of my cravings. Haven''t had a cigarette since. I'm not saying people should go out and try it because I have little to no medical knowledge, but it worked for me"You may not see this.. or maybe you will.. Idk. But what I did was more physical activity and other stuff to take my mind off of the subject of snoking. And also hang out with friends who don't smoke."10 years smoking.. I've quit twice before and caved after 4 months both times... now on my latest attempt at quitting. Tried mid january, but while I still had tobacco products I just couldn't. I had a pouch of rolling tobacco that I tried throwing out, but ended up pulling back out the bin. but that finally went last night and I've told myself I'm not buying any more cigs. I've got patches and the such at work, but there I'm busy and don't notice it as much... its while I'm at home, doing nothing that I get the cravings... e-cigs help a bit, but living in a house with 2 other smokers doesn't help so much

still. today marks 1 day. its 11pm and I'm planning on bed soon. and I looked in the mirror like 15 minutes ago and felt proud of myself... I'm hoping I can get that feeling every day this coming week. I'm leaving this tab open with advice from those whos succeeded and going to peruse it casually when I crave."Keep going! Good luck to you! Stay strong! what about day 2"A bit late to the discussion, but here is how i quit OP.

I was smoking heavily for 5 years, and my family & gf kept telling me to quit. Im telling you, most of the time when people force/keep telling you to quit, it WONT work. 

4 years into smoking, i fell in love with Fitness. I found out that I loved to run/jog leisurely, and i felt like shit every time I ran. I ran out of breath easily, coughed shit up and felt like shit. I then tried to smoke only 1 stick per day on running day, and Walla! I could run better, breathe better.

So for me, i found a new subititue to smoking, that is running. And today would be my 1 year 5 months of not smoking. I wish you luck, and I failed on my 4th attempt to quit, and I kept trying till it worked. 
"Best of luck to stay quit. And thank you!"Cold turkeyed for a week after 6 months of 5 cigarettes a day.
A week later I took up vaping, currently using 11ml liquid.

I used to laugh if someone mentioned me going cold turkey.  

Then I read the book. Amazing.  I'm now on day 14 and feeling great.  I'm the past when trying to quit cold turkey I had shitty mood swings, cold sweats,  insomnia etc etc.  This time,  nothing.  Seriously fucking nothing!

I remember I just did not enjoy my last cigarette of my last pack and I was like fuck it I'm not buying more.  So I didnt.

I think what helped make it so easy for me to quit was me and my roommate both quit like 2 days apart.  So I feel like if I smoke in letting him down and visa versa ""I tried numerous times to quit smoking. When I was finally able to stop I went cold turkey. You have to really decide that you are in a place that you will be able to stop. You have to believe that you will succeed, and you have to have a plan on what you will do when urges come up. You said you work in health care, so when you would normally take the break to smoke instead time that time to have a snack, go take a breather (away from others that are smoking). Just because you are not smoking does not not mean that you are not entitled to take that time to do something else. Don't have cigarettes on you at work and let others know that you are trying to quit so they will  not to give you one if you ask.

I could buy one pack of smokes, or two gallons of milk.  I got the milk, and never bought another pack of cigs again.  I bummed a grand total of twelve cigs over the next two weeks, but by the time I lit up the last one, it tasted so nasty that I handed it back, half-smoked, to the person I'd bummed it from.  Never smoked again.  That was in March, 2005.""Just stop smoking; it's not hard, you just have to have some willpower.""Cold turkey for me. The thing is, I looked at smoking as something I didn't want in my life anymore. So, I looked at myself as someone who really wanted to quit. That was the foundation for staying a non-smoker. 

One other thing, when quitting, please understand that it's hardest in the beginning. Habits are powerful. Because, randomly, out of nowhere, say three days in the urge hits. Power through it. Seriously, it might only last a few minutes. Three weeks in, urge hits, power through (go get a coffee instead....hell, maybe even a beer) and pat yourself on the back remembering how you fought it off that first time. 

Several weeks in, urge hits again and you consider actually going to buy some smokes. Instead, think of the times you were able to resist. Celebrate with more beer and relish how strong you are at resisting while also drinking beer. Start feeling invincible. Then, maybe, come to the realization that it's getting easier. Cigarettes are shit and make you feel like shit. Maybe, then, a moment of clarity. You really, truly don't even want a cigarette. That urge you're feeling is just an artifact of habit, it doesn't even make sense anymore. Go out and party. ""Will power. 

Seriously. You have to actually **want** to quit; there aren't any shortcuts or elixirs.

Specifically, for me, I needed to break it down and examine _what_ it was that I associated with smoking (e.g. drinking, being bored, after meals, etc) and focused on those moments.""FINALLY a real response.

You've got a subconscious program running that you have no control over, it's that simple.  Find someone who works using NLP to help you change the patterns.

I'll use emotional eating as an example to simplify but smoking is no different, I can usually break emotional eating in one or two sessions however smoking does take a bit more work.

Basically as a child, teen or at some point in our lives we seek out food to sooth us.  If we do this often enough the subconscious then associates a craving (ie chocolate) as an appropriate response to a trigger (overwhelment for example).  It then begins to fire off hunger cravings for that particular food when that emotion sets in.  This is a subconscious pattern that you don't know exists and you have no control in consciously changing on your own, similar to anxiety.

With the help of a practitioner that specializes in the subconscious (using NLP - neuro linguistic programming) you can very easily reprogram that behavior.  Before xmas I helped someone change their overeating when feeling overwhelmed to going to their office and writing (which was the new desired state). It took about 40 minutes total.

Smoking is more complex however this is THE big part of the equation most people are missing when it comes to trying to quit smoking.

hope that helps ! ""I've quit 3 times in my life, once for 3 years, once for one year, an now I've gone a month.  Each time for me it was a decision that I'd be better off not smoking than smoking.  It sounds really lame, but that's all it was.  This most recent time, I kept saying...no more after x date, but that day would come and go, and I'd still have a pack, so I'd finish the pack, then end up buying another.  First it was September 1st, then for a trip to Chicago in October, then Thanksgiving, and finally 1/1.  I think the big difference the last time was,  I didn't give myself the chance to finish the pack.  I destroyed any that were still left before I went out that night and that was it.  Not having them around allowed me to be able to not justify finishing the pack, and I've not had any since.""Im such a huge huge lurker, rarely post, but I guess my time has come.

Let me tell you how peaceful it is to just not want a cigarette... ever: very. 

You don't smoke. That shit is for teenagers. ""This is the only thing that's kept me off. I've told all my friends and family that if they see me smoking a cigarette, they can kick me in the balls. 

General stipulations: shisha, cigars, and spliffs with someone else's tobacco are fair game and I can smoke to my hearts content. Those weren't habitual for me and I probably engage in those less than once a month. Cigarettes were my go-to and the hardest for me to give up. 

That's where my friends come in. They would so gleefully tolchock me in the yarbles because I'd asked them to, that I honestly fear ballpain more than the urge to smoke a cigarette. I've now been cigarette free for 732 days and counting, and it's been great.

I grabbed some nicotine gum form walmart when i decided i wanted to stop (always get the most powerful stuff they have in terms of nicotine levels) and picked a date. For the first few days i used the gum, but since it was so powerful i couldnt chew it for long (i smoked a half pack to a pack a day). After about a week the too strong gum made me cringe and i had already made the decision not to smoke any more so i just let it go. 

Just remember it is a behavior you control, even if you brain thinks it is addicted to nicotine. Mentally decide your willpower is stronger than some stupid chemical and never smoke another cigaret again. Once you have decided to really stop (not just ""i should probably quit"") then it is easy to not smoke again, as that is what you told yourself and there are no ways around NEVER AGAIN, even in your own mind. No exceptions, no alternatives, never again. Cold turkey after the first week or so of using too strong nicotine gum and you're golden. 

I still think about how much i enjoyed the social implications and oral fixation when ever i smell them / people talk about them but it is easy to just remember i already had my last cigaret and i simply refuse to go back on that.

I got a Kanger Evod e-cig and had it ready for me for the date of my quit.  I filled it up and did not look back.  It took a couple of days for the e-cig to actually take for me.

This was a big motivator for me, I smoked for about 7 years and quit cold turkey 2 years ago. After 48 hours all I could think about was ""I dont ever want to do that again"" and I would look at my health information ""Alright 4 hours until its been 72 hours and my physical withdrawal will have peaked. Then after a few more days just keep thinking I never want to have to quit again. 

Took about 3 months for me to get to a point where I could go a whole day without thinking of a cigarette. The worst part is I would have dreams that were so lifelike, I would be hanging out with a friend and we would smoke a cig in my dream, I would get so upset with myself I would wake up. Or the random thoughts of ""Dude you  have been doing so well quitting lets celebrate with a cig!"""Hypnotherapy worked best for me.

So what actually worked was me.""That feeling in your lungs, you cant run as fast, you get tired fast and in general, it feels bad

The burning sensation in your mouth while smoking is just worse, what's even worse are the needles that you feel while actually inhaling the smoke and in general, it leaves a bad scent, some really broken teeth and some breathing issues.

If you still want to ""smoke"" just use the E-cig only instead of buying packs of cigarettes, it's by far the only way to stop the bad scents and eventually, quit smoking.""If you made the decision, you're a non-smoker now. Do not think of yourself as a ""smoker trying to quit"". You have been a smoker, you're not a smoker any more. And most importantly, now means *now*. Don't finish your pack. Don't even smoke a 'last cigarette'. 

First thing to do is to throw away what you still have lying around. It's not about finishing what you have and *not buying any more*, it's about *not smoking any more*.

Second thing is to wash your curtains and air out your apartment/house/room. Even if you don't perceive it as such, the stench is there and getting rid of it will help you reduce your cravings.""I'm not sure anyone *truly* quits.

Nicorrette lozenges are nice."I was tired of waking up every morning and hacking up a lung at 25 years old so I woke up one morning and decided that was the day I'd quit. I feel the most important part is really convincing yourself you want to stop. I also believe cold turkey is the best way to do it. One thing that helped me was joining a gym and exercising. I haven't had a cigarette in 10 years."You have to want it more than you want to smoke. I smoked for 15 years and went to an e-cig and then abruptly lost it and continued not smoking from there.

I have to give some credit to the e-cig, but I really wanted to stop smoking more than anything. I just hated everything about it."I quit cold turkey two weeks ago. I had a sinus infection along with a history of sinus problems. I was only smoking three a day though so feeling better is what did it for me.I told every one I knew that I quite. That way they would give me shit if I started again and they wouldn't hold it against me if I was being a dick from the withdraws."I had the ultimate trifecta to help me quit. I was on a vacation with my sister and a good friend over new years. Neither of them smoked which helped because most of my friends at that point did. My friends father had just passed away from lung cancer and he was using part of his inheritance to finance the vacation. So new years eve, I had my last smoke and for the next couple of weeks I was a moody prick, but being away from smokers and being with a friend who'd just lost his father due to smoking, it was much easier to overcome. Probably the best decision i've ever made. Good luck to whoever out there is trying to quit. Just remember that you are only trying to stop yourself from having one cigarette. Just repeat that process every time you want one.  ""Ex-smoker here. I smoked from 15-24 or so and have been largely cigarette free for about 4 years. I used the patch (off brand was cheaper) and it worked. I didn't go through the whole program... Essentially after two weeks I was just done and it didn't seem like I needed it any more. The wife quit too. I'll recommend the patch to anyone. Also, it needs to be a commitment and the right time in your life, but if you need a leg up, I'd suggest patching. ""Not me, but I remember one day at a young age (like 7) I broke my dad's cigarettes in half and threw them away. He asked me if it bothered me that he smoked (never near me, mind you). I said yes and he said ""Ok, I quit"". Sometimes seeing that it really bothers someone you care about helps.""It took me 10 years of trying before I got past 3 months.

Make sure you get a high enough nicotine content in your juice so you don't get the cravings to smoke real cigarettes.  I used to smoke about two packs every three days which worked out to about $100/week.  I bought a lot of juices and hardware so I was fully invested in e-cigs and have never looked back.

First, I stopped smoking in my house--which meant that I would have to go outside to smoke (on rainy or cold days, this was a deterrent). Then, I started leaving my smokes in my car, so I would only smoke when I was going to and from somewhere, or I would go out to my car on breaks at work.

One day, I ran out of smokes, and never bought another. It helps that none of my friends at the time were smokers, which meant I wasn't pressured by the social aspect of smoking.""I quit cold turkey on New Years and after a month, I no longer consider myself a smoker.

During clinical trials of the drug Welbutrin researchers noticed that a large number of participants where spontaneously quitting smoking with zero prompting. They then studied this effect and realized this was a fantastic ""Quit smoking pill"" and started marketing it under the name Zyban.

Ask your doctor to prescribe it as Welbutrin and your insurance will cover it. If you have truly decided to quit it should take less than 30 days. Then it is just a matter of getting through a few months of slowly fading urges until you reach the point were you can't believe you ever smoked in the first place.

At the current cost of Cigarettes, figure out how much you will save in the first six months and then chose a reward to purchase for your success, something you have always wanted but couldn't justify spending the money on. Whenever you start thinking about how long it has been since you had a smoke and how that makes you feel, change the thought to how much closer you are to your reward and how you are going to feel the day you get it.

Also, figure out how many minutes a day you spend outside during work smoking. Come up with a plan to use this time to make yourself a better employee/co-worker. Whenever you get the urge to go take a smoke break remember how you have decided to replace the long term detrimental effects of doing that with the long term beneficial effects of being better at what you do. You will be amazed at how many 5 minute breaks you can think of that achieve this. For example, make a pot of coffee and straighten up the break area or do that small thing that nobody ever does but could really use doing or take a ""joke"" break were you go around telling everyone a cheesy joke that will make them smile.

Good Luck!""Not a smoker but talking with people who quit.

The whole process will take you about one month to complete.

1-  Let's say that you smoke a pack(20) a day. On the first day, buy your usual brand of smokes (do not buy lights if you don't already smoke those), open the pack and remove two cigs. Toss them in the trash, keep them in a box, whatever doesn't matter as long as you will not have easy access to them. Either the next day or two days form then when you buy another pack remove 4 cigs and discard them. Repeat the steps as the days progress buy removing two plus cigs per day until buy the end of the process you buy a pack only to smoke two cigarettes. (BONUS: It will occur to you that you just spent almost $7 pending on where you live for two GD cigs and you will wonder why you even smoke in the first place)

2- This one is simple. Cut back on any alcohol consumption because as you are probably already aware of when you're drinking you're smoking. If you're drinking less then you're less likely to light up another smoke.

3- Probably the most important. If you aren't already, start having sex with a non-smoker. Quitting smoking can really increase the amount of sex you are having and trust me nothing will get you denied faster then when your SO hates that you smell (and taste) like smoke. This can be mutually beneficial too. Get your partner in on providing an incentive not to smoke, I'm not saying trade sex for not smoking but rather that if both you and your SO are non-smokers sex will be much more enjoyable for both of you. (BONUS: It's a proven fact that smoking does hinder your sexual performance, long term smoking does cause the blood vessels in you body to shrink and shrinking blood vessels may lead to shrinking pecker.)""What helped me most was the good old out of sight, out of mind approach. Every now and then I may take a few drags when drunk, but it only serves to remind me of how much I hate the smell and taste. And it only happens when I'm surrounded by other smokers.""First, you have to want to quit. Whatever reason that may be: you don't want to smell like an ashtray anymore, the cute girl in yoga pants on your floor, your wife is pregnant with your child. Without the desire, you'll sabotage your own attempts to quit or backslide quickly.

With the desire, there's plenty of ways to quit.  

For me, Chantix was *incredibly* effective.  It's an expensive prescription, and some people react badly to it, but it blocks nicotine receptors in your brain, so that you don't get the effects when you smoke. Lots of people, within 3-5 days just look at their cigarette, decide it's gross, and put it out.  And they're done. It sounds too simple, but i swear it really was like that.

Full disclosure: a co-worker of mine had bad side effects, it was screwing up his sleep cycle and he was depressed -- really messed with him.  That happens to some people.  I had **super**-vivid dreams (for me, not a bug, a feature) and some stomach issues, but it was so totally worth it.

(~2 years smoke free)""You definitly need to know you want to quit, but I set a date far in the future. Then I proceeded to tell everybody I knew that I was quitting on that date. When that date rolled around I had tonnes of pressure to quit, and had a precise date I could remember to track how long it's been since my last cigarette. I quit September 12, 2012 :D.

All I can remember thinking was ""this time?!? What the hell?!?"" As it turns out this was his 4th battle with cancer... I was completely oblivious to the other 3 and had been smoking in front of this friend for years. Like any friend I asked what I could do to help, I was told that he could no longer watch me smoke because of the battles with cancer that his father had. Since I have received that phone call I haven't smoked a single cigarette.""I was a casual smoker in college and for a while after graduating. I finally decided one day that I didn't want to smoke any more, so I didn't. 

Quitting smoking requires one simple thing: desire. You have to want to quit. ""As an addict, I understood that 1 cigarette was too many and 1,000 never enough.  I didn't enjoy the taste of cigs anymore, didn't enjoy the smell, didn't enjoy the smoke, didn't enjoy the mess, didn't enjoy the hassle, and didn't enjoy the expense.

I got a nicotine patch, and wore it for a week.  During that week I avoided people, places, and situations where smoking occurred.  That helped me break the physical association of smoking in the morning, during breaks, at lunch, on the drive home, after dinner, after sex, ect...  Instead I had sugar free lemon drops and straws to chomp on, you know, to help with the oral fixation. After that week I took the patch off and went through nicotine withdrawal while still avoiding that stuff for a time.  Then I eased myself back into environments where people smoked and choose not to stare at them while smoking and at their cigarettes.  16 years nicotine free now.""I got really sick, the kind of sickness where you lose your cravings for nicotine.  When I realized I could use the sickness to my advantage to get past the first two weeks (honestly the only truly difficult weeks), I also went ahead and scheduled my wisdom teeth removal for around the first day that I should be recovering from my illness.  It worked like a charm, once you make it to the part where your lungs start to clean themselves and you hack stuff up for about a week, then you've gotten past the worst of it.  This is just the method that worked for me, after many years and attempts at quitting this was the plan I devised, I just had to wait for the right sickness to come along.""Woke up on a Saturday morning and went to hang out with friends in a diner.  Smoked A LOT that morning, a lot more than normal.  By about 2pm, I was short of breath, and had a weird stabbing pain in my lung.  Decided that hopefully it was an asthma attack, and if emphysema felt even a little bit like that feeling did...I didn't want it.  Threw my last pack away, went to buy patches and just kept on *not* smoking.  Was a raving bitch for the first month.  S.O. said if I ever started again, I wasn't allowed to quit again.  I was that cranky.  

I work in health care too.  Saved my ass- substitute headphones/ipod and a good walk for your smoke breaks.  

Good luck.  It'll be 10 years this fall for me.  It gets easier the longer you stay smokefree.   ""I used the patch for a week and then just stopped using that too. I've been cigarette free for 32 days. I initially quit because I got bronchitis and then the news that I would have had cancer in a year or two if my doctor hadn't pulled some polyps out of my colon. So, I have the motivation of not wanting to die. It's helpful."I just one day was like - yea I like air... so I stopped"Cold turkey. What really made it happen was tracking the time and number of cigarettes I didn't smoke. There's an app on my phone that placed a huge widget on my homescreen that kept track of that and a lot of other information. It was really motivating to see the numbers increase, and when I thought about smoking I actually thought about how sad I would be when it reset to 0!""I wore the patch for 1 week then just went without. I had a really rough month after that, it was much much harder than I ever thought it would be. I held tight though, and one day i noticed I was no longer obsessing over it and since then it's just been great. I hit one year in November and I never thought I'd be able to do it.

Quitting smoking is a decision, and when you remove nicotine from your system you have to make that same decision a million times a day at first. Then it will be a thousand times a day, and then a hundred times a day and on and on until you no longer think about it at all.""Very much this. There were a few added things I did to help keep the right perspective. I found a website that offered 20 tips, and I remember a few that it listed that actually helped. 

One, take a photo of someone you love and keep it with you. Write on it, ""I'm doing this for me and for you."" Anytime you feel compelled to smoke, take a moment to look at that picture. 

Two, aim for 21 days. Through hell and high waters promise yourself you'll make it the 21 days. It takes up to this long to ultimately break a physical habit. Remember, it's not just quitting nicotine absorption that's happening, there's many things, associations and patterns, you have to flip... like the hand gesture to your face, smoking with a meal, with a coffee, with a beer, on break from work, etc. It takes times to break away from these habits. 

Finally, I proved to myself it was a choice. I had almost a full carton of cigarettes when I quit. I believe people typically give away their leftover cigarettes or quit ""after this pack."" I took the carton and placed it in the trunk of my car, and there it stayed. I knew I could go for it at anytime, but it reinforced many good feelings in me to be the one in control. ""I can... I could... I won't because what I want is so much more...""

I have been smoke free for years now.

Mathematically, aside from the extra years I may potentially live as a result, I have given myself at least one extra hour in every day. Minimum of 12 cigarettes a day, taking approximately 5 minutes each to smoke, is 60 minutes EVERY day. I just didn't want to be that parent staring up at his child from his deathbed 'saying' I wish I had more time with you. I proved that's how I feel. ""Rolled out of bed, stepped outside for my morning fix, and promptly vomited after the first drag. Last time I ever smoked one. """"When the why is powerful enough ... the how is easy"" I got pregnant 9 years ago and quit cold turkey after smoking for almost 15 years. It was ridiculously hard but I knew I had to do it for the baby. 
My why was powerful enough because it was for someone other than myself. 

Find your why and hold onto it. When you feel like you're slipping go back to that why.

My other advice is to replace a habit with a new habit. I,too, used to go outside and light up during breaks. So I had to replace that habit with a new one: I'd make myself a toast in the break room. I was then beginning to look forward to the toast instead of the cigarette. 

Best of luck to you. It's very tough but the light you see on the other side of the tunnel isn't a train, I promise. ""You have to set goals and be serious. 
For me it was fitness.""My dad used to smoke all the time when I was a little kid. When I was 8 years old at soccer practice, he decided to help out with a drill. He got winded very quickly, and, due to many other bad diet and exercise decisions throughout his adult life, had a heart attack right there on the field. After a quadruple bypass heart surgery, he quit absolutely cold turkey right then and there. I haven't seen him smoke in 16 years since....he was very irritable for a while though ""I stopped saying ""I'm trying to quit"" and started saying ""I don't smoke""""Sucks that you're having trouble. After 15 years of smoking, and trying to quit, one thing worked for me when I put the smokes down. Drink an absolute ton of water. It'll fullfill the craving, flush your system, and make you get up to pee every few hours as though you were going out to smoke. I drank a bottle or two an hour for a few weeks. At one point I realized I hadn't thought about smoking in a really long time and felt really great. Not only had I effectively quit, but I also cleansed my system. If you wipe out soda and crap food during these few weeks the side effects could also include weight loss (by a lot), mood changes, better sleep, clearer mind, and improved memory. These will help affirm how shitty cigarettes made you feel and keep you on track indefinitely. Good luck."Non smoking girlfriend and chantix."e-cigs. switched hard to e-cig (you need one which does tons of vape, and you need liquids that feel raspy (at least at first), and refillable tanks), then (SLOWLY!) tricked myself into not knowing how much nictoine was in the tanks I was vaping.
I did that by mixing the liquids myself (not difficult) and varying the doses between *unmarked* cartridges. Also : plenty of flavours to test from, so it never got boring.
I stopped cigarettes in October (partially 4 days back on them around christmas due mostly to peer pressure), and stopped vaping completely in the following february. 

That was 2 years ago. Not one (active) bit of nicotine (or vape) since.
"Decided to just quit. It's hard for a few weeks but literally it was all about making sure I didn't buy a new pack and eventually I just didn't need it anymore."Just allow yourself to be happy without the cigs. Tell yourself ""Oh here are 5 minutes I would have smoked. Maybe I'll just do nothing but feel happy about my life. I'm a great person"" Blah blah blah. Bullshit like that. It works, but it's cheesy. You just gotta believe in it.""I smoked a pack or more a day, every day from the age of 18 until I was 23.  I decided to quit after hearing a recording of me singing.  Here's what I did:

I put a strong rubber band around my wrist.  Every time I thought about smoking, even if I just saw somebody else smoking, I gave myself a snap on the wrist with the rubber band.  Hard enough to leave a welt, but not break the skin.  Before the second week was over, I was able to take off the rubber band.  

From day one of quitting, I made it four years TO THE DAY without having a smoke, or even bad cravings after the first week.  Then I had a terrible day where I found out my intended fiancee was cheating on me, so I broke up with her and met my friend at a bar.  After being there a few minutes together he pulled out a smoke and I asked for one...he looked at me like I was an idiot but like he had no business lecturing me...so he gave me one.  Now I have a smoke once every couple of months when I'm drunk, and I always regret it immediately, and **really** regret it the next day.

This happened to me back in November, if I remember correctly, after starting smoking after a bad breakup after graduating highschool in 2011. I haven't touched but a single cigarette since. "E-Cigs Started with 11MG then went to 6MG then went to 0MG and now i just puff water vapor because I still have the oral fixation "The thing is, is you just have to decide that you want to quit more than you want to smoke. And, just think that the desire for a cigarette goes away whether you smoke one or not, so may as well not. I quit back in '05, and it was the best thing I ever did for myself. Love yourself enough to quit!""I quit 1 month ago. I got pneumonia and could barely function or breathe, so I couldn't smoke for a while anyway. It's super-friggin' cold where I am, so being outside is a stupid idea. I don't want to drive with my windows open, either. I picked up some 4mg nicotine gum to fight the urge. 

The gum has helped me get through the wee hours when I'd really like to light up. It's also helped in the morning. I wanted to quit anyway and the sickness helped me by forcing me to stop for a few days. 

to sum up:

1) Get a bad illness that prevents you from breathing properly
2) Get some 4mg nicotine gum
3) Really want it. Convince yourself that you are sticking it to the man by depriving your government of easy excise taxes
4) Enjoy not having to stop at gas stations or dealing with the anxiety related to waiting to smoke, finding somewhere to smoke, buying cigarettes, etc. 
5) Put the money you'd spend in a pile. For me, it's about $1,000 a year, so I hope to do something with that money next year. 
6) Remind yourself that you'll probably live longer and get more time for fun stuff and to be with people you like. 
7) I've quit more than 5 times, so understand that it won't always take. Cigarettes today have more nicotine, so are harder to quit than ever. Don't get too hard on yourself. 

It's only been a month for me, but I hope that I stay smoke free. It's cool and fun, but it's time to give it up. ""I had quit a few times in the past, but one day something just clicked and I reached a mindset where I was fed up with being a smoker.

I did not want to be that guy who was diagnosed with cancer or some other illness when I was in my mid-30's (my aunt and uncle were/are in their mid-80's).""Visit whyquit.com for FREE help and ideas!!!


""I quit using the step down patch method. The patches were provided by the 1-800-QUITNOW program.

Basically, for about four weeks before quitting I changed up my routines. No smoking in the car, no smoking right after a meal, no smoking right when I woke up. I'd put my cigarettes in the trunk of my car, after a meal I would wash all the dishes or finish whatever I was watching on TV before a smoke, etc. Then, one day I smoked my usual pack and the next day when I woke up, I put a patch on and I haven't smoked in 7 years. Once I had broken up those usual smoking habits and the patch took care of the actual physical craving for nicotine, it was easy. I thought I would never be able to quit, but really, it was one of the easiest things I've ever done.""I just decided to stop.  Cold Turkey.  Threw my last pack away while I was driving across the country and never bought another.  I still want to smoke occasionally, and I can't say I'll never start again, but that's what worked for me.  Haven't had a smoke in around 2 years now. ""I quit on LSD. I'd smoked at least a pack a day for almost ten years, and then I quit unexpectedly during an acid trip one night and never touched another one (that was 14 years ago). ""Electronc cigarettes are the way to go,you get your nicotine and you still feel like you're inhaling something,and they're super tasty 
""Gradual cessation. Went from a pack a day to nothing in a little over three months. Also drank lots of water and exercised. Found the less I smoked the better I did hiking, lifting, etc. Pretty good motivator.

It's really not that hard. As cliche as it sounds, you just have to want it bad enough."I felt like it was my time. I went cold turkey and started drinking lots of water so the addiction that was a cover was a healthy choice and now i drinks water more than ever.Realziing that I actually don't like smoking. I aligned the logical reasons not to smoke with the feeling of not wanting to smoke (I made sure I really didn't enjoy my last few cigarettes) and then I stopped having them. I still have a pack of Marlboro Lights sitting in my dresser from last March.My kids"Identify your primary type of addiction. Is it simply nicotine? Is it the ritual/habitual kind? Is it the social component? Go from there.

I was the habitual type. Tried to quit many times, always failed because i cut out everything, all those little breaks, the coffee with the cigarette or the self-reward after completing a task.

I realized a was missing these things more than the smoking, so like three years ago i just quit the cigarettes, and kept up all the silly habitual things. I won't lie, i partly compensated for it by eating and put on a few kg, but that was still healthier than smoking.

This in turn made me reconsider my eating habits. Now, some three years later, I'm smoke free and down 20kg, happier and fitter than ever.""Electronic cigarette. It made it so easy. Of course, I'm still using nicotine, but it's much healthier and you can taper down the nicotine level over time to zero.""CHANTIX! I smoked about a pack a day for 15 years from age 14 to 29. I tried patches, cold turkey, Alan Carr's book, all sorts of things. Chantix was the only thing that worked for me.

I haven't smoked a cigarette in almost 6 years now. It's absolutely wonderful to be free of it."Due to my lack of willpower....Chantix.  Worked well though.  1 year and counting!"This might be too late to the party, but I recently quit using chewing tobacco. Recently I was using around a can of chew a day, or the nicotine equivalent of 3 and 1/2 packs a day. 

My solution?  Cold turkey. Seriously, if you want to quit, you will. I still have cravings, but giving yourself pep talks about the benefits of quitting help to curb these.""Late to the thread, but personally I am a fan of cold turkey. The first time I did it, I made it seven months without a cigarette, then caved one day. Queue me smoking fairly heavily for the next two months, then once again going cold turkey. I quit the day after Christmas, although occasionally a friend will bum me a cigarette while were hanging out.

I should probably mention, the first time I did this my cravings were pretty minimal. I made it seven months without a single smoke, yet at the moment it has probably been three weeks since I've had a cigarette, and I have been craving one for about a week. Presumably it's because school is stressful, I have it everyday, and lastly because you are never really a nonsmoker. ""My Mum's partner used to smoke until one day when his daughter was about 6 she went over to him in the garden while he was smoking and said ""You know how I never knew my Grandad? If you carry on smoking you might never know your grandchildren"" Then he quit there and then."Getting pregnant. "Understanding that I'm screwing myself by doing it. You see lots of publicity about how smoking is bad for you, and you logically understand and agree, but is not untill you ""intuit"" it that it'll make a difference. Once I understood that, it took a couple of weeks of effort. After the third week it was easier. It took years to me to smell a cigarette and disgust me.""I got really sick, and I needed to have surgery, my doctor told me that if I continued to smoke, I would be at MUCH greater risk for death during surgery and during recovery, so much so that he wouldn't perform my operation unless I hadn't smoked in at least 30 days, there were other doctors who would do the surgery, but he was the best in the field in my state, so it was either quit smoking or find another doctor.  I was feeling like death already, so I just threw them away...figuring it couldn't get worse.  It sucked to stop, but not even close to how bad it was to be suffering as I was with my other medical issues. Thirty days later and a piss test showed that I had actually stopped, I went right in for surgery, and now about a year later I'm still not smoking and I feel much better.  

Being out of work after surgery for 8 weeks helped too, I was hurting pretty bad for the first month and the painkillers I was on reduced my desire to smoke.  By the time I was off them, I had no desire to smoke any more.  ""I just stopped. I didn't enjoy the way they made me feel anymore. 

The hardest part is breaking the habit of going to smoke when you need a break from whatever you're doing. If your mind developed that problem (like most smokers), find something that lasts about the same amount of time but doesn't have negative health effects. When I noticed that feeling at my desk I took a break to do stretches and minor physical activity. By replacing an old habit with something that made me feel better and more focused, I had no desire to smoke again.

Idle hands and an idle mind will be your biggest obstacle to staying quit.""Oh yeah, and about it being the only way to get breaks... Use the lack of nicotine anger. Seriously, make the first person who criticizes you for not working feel the wrath of your withdrawal. If you are ""trying to quit"" and someone comments negatively on your new healthy break, make them feel terrible for supporting unhealthy habits. If you make them the bad guy they'll back off, and you now have a verbal contract to quit smoking or otherwise be a huge ass for putting a person in their place (correctly) but being too much of a hypocrite to follow through.
""First off, you have to actually care about your health: that's really all it takes. If you don't really care about dying prematurely, then nothing will get you to quit *because you don't want to*. Until you actually decide that you want to live as long as possible, & not die from a heart attack (leading cause of death for cigarette smokers), or lung cancer (2nd leading cause of death for cigarette smokers), or some other cancer, then why would you quit? I quit because I got a re-occurring sore on my lip & I thought, ""this drug isn't worth my lip... losing my lip to cancer isn't worth it"". It's pretty crappy drug, so I used patches to stop withdrawals, & then I just weaned myself off. edit: Cigarette smokers die 10 years earlier than non-smokers... ~400,000 Americans annually. "asthma"Didn't have time to read all the comments so if this is a repeat, sorry. 

I quit cold turkey after trying patches and pills. The thing that really helped me do this was I continued to go out on smoke breaks but I just didn't smoke.  It will take a few days to break the physical addiction but after that it's all about just saying no. 

Good luck!""Gum, no. Patches, no. Hypnosis worked for a bit. Nothing was even remotely successful compared to the day I finally made up my mind that I was never smoking one again and quit cold turkey. My heart wasn't in it the first 7 tries I guess.""I stopped smoking. Same with my wife.

You want to stop? Then just stop. Don't buy them, and don't bum them. If you can't hang around people while they're smoking, don't hang out during smoke breaks with smokers.

The key was just not to do it. Everyone makes a bigger deal of it than it really is, and that makes people think it's ok to fail at quitting. It's not that hard, just do it, and quit bitching about it.

*prepares for the downvote brigade of ""you just don't understand"" even though my wife and I quit cold turkey the same way.*"Playing rugby and chewing tobacco"I figured out my triggers and quit them one by one in a process that took almost three years. For the last year I smoked two a day. Lunch and dinner. 

In the end I quit them both at the same time and haven't had one since. It's been so many years that I don't know how long it's been. 

Good luck. ""I picked a long weekend, threw away ashtrays,lighters etc and quit cold turkey. The first few days suck, but once you make it to day 4 you're home free. You'll continue to have cravings from time to time, but they subside after a few minutes. 

source- former smoker of 20 years""It took me two years to go from ""I'm a smoker so what"" to quitting.  First I had to change my frame of mind from being a smoker to not wanting to be a smoker. Then over the course of two years I moved to the lightest cigarettes I could find and tried repeatedly to quit.  I knew I never really quit in my current situation. The habit of going on break - cigarette, done with work - cigarette, cup of coffee -cigarette, beer - cigarette, finished eating - cigarette etc. was too overwhelming for me to give up. I could do without one it two for a while but eventually one of the habits would get me going again.  

Everyone has to quit cold turkey at some point. Eventually one has to say ""never again"".  What got me there and was the major turning point was moving to another city.  I knew I was moving for a few months before so during those months I tried as hard as I could to taper my smoking off as much as possible. When I got to my new life, though the temptation was high, I never smoked again.  For me the association of a new life in a new city helped the most to break the habits. Being able to pick a hard divide as to when I was no longer a smoker and plan for it is what got me over.  

Seven years and I've even had a cigarette or two since but never came close to starting again. ""Shattered my leg while still living at home. Mom wouldn't let me smoke in the house, too much of a hassle to make it downstairs and outside. Plus I was high on painkillers so that helped with the cravings."Lung cancer"Got a chest infection after smoking excessively over Xmas...had one more cigarette the next day that ended in spending the 4 days nearly coughing up my liver.Safe to say I'm 31 days clear but this was borne out of necessity and not wanting to quit...but have realised, experiencing such an incident can help you realise the dangers of not quitting...hopefully bullet dodged...

Edit:Cold Turkey!! Only answer...""Cold turkey. Also it moved to a new city at the time, so there weren't any places that I was in the habit of smoking at""I found it easy to stop smoking once I moved to Africa because not a lot of people smoke here... Though I doubt it would be your cheapest option. I would say just go cold turkey. 

I found out through my mother that my Uncle stopped smoking because he was hypnotised to thinking every cigarette was a cock and that every time he put one in his mouth he was supposedly sucking cock. It worked.""I quit a 10 year 1/2-1 pack a day habit about 15 years ago.  I did a lot of research on symptoms and effects of physical withdrawal from nicotine, so I knew and could identify the physical aspects of withdrawal - and I interpreted those physical signs as ""It's WORKING!!!, I'm detoxing from cigarettes!! Yay!!!""  Because being positive never hurts, right?  :)  

Then, AT THE SAME TIME, I based on my research experience, I employed a combination of avoiding trigger locations (so don't go to, look at, walk by, think about the location where you typically smoke at work) and adding a competing response:  In my case, it was drinking a Clearly Canadian (which were delicious, RIP Clearly Canadian).  NOTE:  your competing response should be something you LIKE.  I've heard of people doing weird stuff like wearing a rubber band around their wrist then snapping themselves whenever they thought about smoking.  That's insane.  Stopping smoking is hard enough, you should at least be nice to yourself.  :)  Good luck!!

Edit:  I did not wait until withdrawals had passed to employ the competing response/trigger avoidance.  Those went into effect Day 1
"I set a date. Decided that was going to be the last day. I worked my way into quitting but limiting the amount I was allowed to have each day. I was at a pack a day. Then I limited myself to half a pack a day for 4 days. then it was 6 a day for 3 days. then 3 a day. then at the date. none. and thats that. "I tried only once, and I've been smoke free for about 4-5 years.  It's been long enough that I don't really keep track of anniversaries.  Here are several tricks that worked for me.

1. **Set a quit date.** When I decided to quit, I didn't do it that day.  I did it a few weeks later.  This is a time-tested trick, because it helps you prepare yourself, and come to terms with saying goodbye to something that's felt like (but not really been) a friend for years.

2. **Visualize cigarettes as a slave driver.** It really helped my motivation to quit, to *really* recognize that I was addicted to nicotine.  This meant paying attention to everything I did in the name of smoking that wasn't good for me; it included throwing away $6 every day, smoking even when my throat was hurting, and going out into the bitter cold when it was nice and warm inside.  I started to think of it cracking a whip at me, saying shit like ""What do you mean, it's cold outside?  Bitch, I *own* you.  *wha-pish!*""

3. **Do it with a buddy.** I quit at the same time as my girlfriend.  It was her idea, really, and she'd been doing it for about 20 years, compared to 5-6 years for me.  Nobody wants to the pussy who quits quitting first.

4. **Go on vacation when you quit, preferably as far away from society as you can get.** This is probably the biggest help, and works on many levels.  We smoke when we're stressed, and there are so many triggers to smoke in our daily lives; getting away from that reduces temptation.  We also turn into irritable assholes when we quit, and getting away from society means you don't take other people down with you when you're in your hole.  Finally, if you're camping in the middle of the woods, it's hopefully a long, long way to the nearest gas station.  They say cravings only last for a few minutes at a time when you get them, and if it takes you well over a few minutes to get to a pack, chances are good you'll talk yourself out of it by the time you get there.

5. **Never, ever, EVER smoke again.** This may sound stupid, but a lot of people fail a quit attempt because they're not planning on quitting forever.  It's easier to think about quitting if, somewhere in the back of your mind, you're thinking about someday in the future where you haven't had a cigarette in three months, and say, ""hey, I quit! This means I can have a cigarette *every once in a while* but I won't keep smoking.""  That's lying to yourself and exactly how you get back into the cycle.  It hurts a lot more to quit *properly*, but that's the only way you're going to do it.  NEVER. SMOKE. AGAIN.

Good luck, OP!""I had smoked for almost 9 years, Marlboro reds for most that time. With the help of my SO, and a visit to the doctor, I took chantix. With that, I told myself ""I'm done, no more"". I have been quit for over a year as of January 17th. ""My then girlriend, now fiancee, soon to be wife refused to have sex with me when I smoked.  That was the end of that.""I switched to a decent vaporizer. (Fancy e-cig) initially I smoked cigarettes and vaped about 1/2 and 1/2. Switched to e-cig exclusively with a high nicotine level. 24mgs kept reducing the level of nicotine over time until I got to 0mg. 

Now, I do occasionally use my vaporizer. Pretty much when being social around smokers. Just to prevent the urges. Especially when drinking. ""In true reddit fashion, this isn't the story of how I quit, but how my dad got my grandma to quit. When my dad was a boy, he hated the way my grandma smoked all the time. what he did was my uncle and him bought some small firecracker like twig from a convenience stores to put inside her cigarettes. So once in a while my grandma would try to take a cigarette and the thing would blow up in her face.


After months of trying to get through a carton without blowing one up she finally quit because she rather have peace and quiet without one then to live in fear with one constantly blowing up in her face.

""I quit with Chantix after 35 years of smoking. Had a great councelor form the American Cancer Society that helped me along the way. It was suggested that before my quit day that I switch brands entirely, from Camel lights to generic menthol cigs. They were horrible and took the fun out of smoking. By the time my quit day arrived I was ready to put those nasty tasting cigs down, proud to say its been 6 years and still not smoking. I still do get a crave from time to time, but you have to be strong and the urge does pass. To all trying to quit, good luck, you can do this.
This whole thing of taste and smell is true, it returns after about 2 weeks smoke free. I can now smell a cig a mile away and so thankful I was able to kick the habit...""Nicorette 4mg cinnamon gum, have not smoked in over 5 years, have zero desire to light up one, however can not stop chewing gum. Instead of searching for cigarette butts, I find myself occasionally re-chewing old gum. Still a lot better than smoking, but yikes the cost.""I smoked for 11 years, started at 13. And the secret to my success was whenever I wanted a cigarette, i didn't have one, and the next time I wanted one, I just didn't have one.

Stop looking for some magical fucking cure to a habit, the only thing that can stop you from doing it, is you wanting to stop doing it."The idea of quitting was far worsr than actually quiting.  Its all a head game.  You just have to get through 4 days and your golden.   Also I used the patches. It was a good deterrent because if you smoked while wearing a patch you got sick"For my dad, it was waking up next to an oxygen tank after a heart attack. He said at that point it was incredibly easy. ""Make the decision to never smoke again. It doesn't work if you just tell yourself to reduce the amount of cigarettes day by day, or just smoke one more and quit after that (or after the current package).

The problem with quitting is not the physical withdrawal. The symptoms only last for 72 hours max. I stopped smoking for more than 72 hours several times, it's not that hard, but after a week or so I always got to the point where I said ""I'll just smoke one"", and so started again. Only when I decided to not do it, come what will, it worked.""Going broke.  Weed or Cig money?  There was no choice, and I've never gone back on that decision.""I tried cold turkey, oral sprays, e-cigs, I tried reading Allen Carrs book but NONE of it worked.

One day I woke up, after a night of drinking and in which I had smoked maybe 40 cigarettes the day before and I just stopped, then and there. I knew I didn't want another one, ever. Since then I have had 1 and 1/2 smokes, while drinking, and only ever use nicotine replacement when drinking (maybe once every 2 months and I don't even crave a smoke, just the nicotine spray!).

I also was SURE that I couldn't drink without smoking (at the time I was an Irish pub manager and was drinking maybe 3 or 4 nights a week), but after that morning I just knew I couldn't smoke anymore. I continued drinking and having a good time, but smoking just wasn't part of my life anymore. 

I can easily say it was the most positive thing I have done in my life.""Re-reading this makes it sound like I have an alcohol problem, but I don't. I was running a pub so it was a big part of my life, and now I rarely drink at all.

anyway....""I used an ecig. Had my wife buy the liquid stuff for it and varied the amount of nicotine with eventually one having no nicotine. When I realised I couldn't tell tue difference I was able to quit. It is still hard though, even smoking the ecig I would crave a real cig. It was just easier to have holding something in your hand when easing off. Its not just the nicotine, you get stuck in the whole routine and movement of smoking. Had lots of those ""I dont know what to do with my hands"" moments. It is still tempting to smoke even after over a year and a hakf almost. Especially when around smokers (though the smell does turn me off of it a bit more thsn I ever remembered)

My wife would probably divorce me if I started smoking again so that helps stay off I guess. "Having a child and realizing I don't want him to associate stale cigarette smell with daddy. I know you already have an ecig... but that was what worked for me. Smoked the ecig for about two months and then it crapped out. So instead of buying another one. I decided that was it. Haven't smoked in 1.5 years. I get the work thing though. I work at a different job now than when I started smoking and no one here smokes. And the stress level is way lower. That made it much easier."My daughter being born. I did it cold turkey and it was difficult but not as bad as I thought it would be. I have a really stressful job but once I got past a few months of not smoking the pain of puffing hurt more than it was worth. I still have cravings, espcially after big meals or really stressful days at work but I generally just try to think about my daughter and how I want to be around for her, her kids and her kids' kid's. ""i used the patch. You have to want to do it, though. I was told at 26 (being THEN of average stature) that I was heading for a heart attack, having experiencing a lot of chest pains. Pretty big motivator, there.""Winter break started, my parwnts and sister all hate smoking so I had to sneak out to smoke. With the cold weather. I just couldn't justify going out. Same thing with my girlfriend, and I couldn't buy them in Mexico (no cash). By the time break was over I hadn't smoked a cig in around 6 weeks.""Zyban.  But I was taking it as Wellbutrin the antidepressant.  At the time I was in group therapy and everyone smoked.  Out of the blue one day (literally I guess haha) my friend was like c'mon we're going outside for a  smoke .... and I said nope, don't feel like it.  Gave my pack away and never picked one up again.  Lasted through sobriety/relapses/ all kinds of stints on drugs.  Just stopped Wellbutrin last year and no desire to start cigs.  I've never heard a similar story but it was miraculous for me.""Im a smoker of 5 years. My last cigarette was on 12/24/13. I tried quitting a few times before but always seemed to relapse. This time I felt different about quitting. Those other few times I was quitting for someone else, parents hated it, girlfriend hated it. But this time I hated it. Felt like shit all the time, coughed out phlegm the size of a softball regularly. So I said fuck it I'm done. A few months prior to quitting I started to save every empty pack of smokes. And just looking at all those boxes, ~ 50 of them, really inspired me to stop. In short do it for you, and find something to hold on to, to remind yourself why your quitting. I wish the best for you."My aunt quit cold turkey. She hasn't gone back in 6 years"I'd say try Chantix but be in the mindset of truly quitting for good. You can continue smoking while taking it but you won't get any nicotine from it since it blocks it. So after a a couple weeks of not getting that ""fix"" it will drive you to just not have one completely and from there it gets easier. My boyfriend quit using Chantix and has been free for a year now! :] Just like you he tired numerous times to quit until he friend told him about Chantix and how it helped him. Worth a try and hope it helps!
"Cold Turkey and a refusal to entertain any of the bullshit excuses I'd made for my addiction"Don't feel defeated if you break and have a drag every once in a while. Just because you did steal a drag or bum a smoke, every few weeks or whatever it may be, it doesn't mean you aren't in a lot better of a position you were in before. I will steal a drag here or there from my friends when I drink- and I don't consider it cheating, because it has kept me from being a regular smoker. I also no longer crave cigarettes, and wouldn't even want to have an entire one to myself anymore. I know that cold turkey is probably the best solution, but it just may not work for everyone. A lot of my friends smoke, and a drag here or there allows me to me to still enjoy the social aspect of it. You can't get down on yourself for having a bit of one, when you normally ( or at least I normally) would have had far too many cigs on a drinking night. With that being said, I had also made the unforced decision to stop. I have tried in the past before, and this time just felt more natural. The problem is, I have always really enjoyed smoking, and now it is something that I dont really want to be part of my life anymore. 
Anyways, I wish you the best of luck. I hope you can find your solution!"combination of actually wanting to quit and a MASSIVE chest infectionNegative association.

Monday night at the gym (with all the new years people still milling about.. but their numbers are dwindling).. I was listening to two men talk about their New Years resolutions. One guy was already a semi-regular face to the gym (the smoker).. the other guy was new to the gym. 

Both guys talked about the changes they were making, and the smoker said that a girl he sees in the lobby of his building asked him if he stopped smoking because she always saw him out front when she went to get coffee.. but he was smoking, she's not a smoker. 
(at this point I just jumped into the conversation with these guys, to no longer eavesdrop like a lunatic)
He told a story about how she wanted to come say hello to him, but as much as she wanted to talk to him, she never approached him outside or got in the elevator with him because he stunk like smoke. Plus she said that she wasnt sure they were compatible because he was a smoker - and presumably, made a ton of other stupid choices in life too.  So this guy is telling us about a girl who wanted to approach him, but because he was a smoker, and stunk.. she didn't. I gathered that they are dating now, because he stopped smoking, and he said that being single for so long, and seeing that smoking gave him not a single benefit in life.. but instead opened new doors.. he quit. I'm straight but he's a good looking guy, and I can absolutely see how smoking would ruin his overall look. 

He also mentioned that how there were many times when friends and family talked to him about smoking, and he hadnt an real excuse to quit. Instead he said that he was really juvenile in his mindset with his ""I can do what I want"" attitude that he said .. came from smoking. He said he was a man with a kids rebellious attitude and he was ashamed of that.

At that point, the other guy started making Cartman voices of ""I do what I want"".. and the tone of the conversation changed..haha. The biggest takeaway from all that for me was hearing an ex smoker admit to smoking (at least one reason) because of ""you cant tell me what I shouldnt do""

You get the point.. I'm rambling now. 
""There is no try. Just decide youre done and then dont do it. Youll feel terrible for a while but at least youll live longer. Also, maybe tell a doctor and get some Wellbutrin. "I just threw it all away and just kinda stopped. I don't know how or why it worked. "I quit cold turkey, smoked a pack a day for six years (and I started when I was 19 - stupid...).

Quitting was a combination of two things: 

One day at university I got a _really_ good whiff of some people coming in from a smoke break. I thought ""holy shit, that's what I smell like to everyone else around me"". When you're _in_ it, you don't smell it as much.

The second thing was laws that forced me to go outside to smoke when it was -10 in the winter cold. I got tired of that shit and decided I'd rather stay inside and not spend $50 a week on cigs anymore and not stink or freeze."Many days not lighthing up a smoke. "Okay, first of all, this *works.* I am not fucking with you at all. I used this method myself and I have not had a cigarette in over three years now. Moreover, I can still be around smokers and not be tortured by the reminder nor made sick by the smell. Honestly, it's all good. I didn't use punishments or any of the conditioning methods because I was worried about the long-term effects of fucking with behavior modification.

So, here it is:

*Be an asshole.*

I'm 100% serious. It's a simple technique that will get you through the hard shit. 

You're going to be a dick anyway because of withdrawal. So instead of fighting it and stressing yourself out more, *embrace it.* 

There is some nuance to this that you'll have to navigate a bit. Obviously, you can't just crank up the dickitude to eleven and start peeing on the menu outside Jack In The Box. What you *can* do is relieve some stress by venting to some very supportive friends who can be amused to see an uncharacteristically aggressive you.^1

Also, you'll need some structure to avoid going insane. Let's face it, there are some terrifying consequences going at this without a plan. You don't want to become an asshole permanently, do you? 

So!

Step One: Tell your friends and co-workers that you're about to be an asshole.

This is vital. They need to know what's up and why ahead of time so they can a) enjoy the show and b) be supportive. It's also important to approach this step very carefully. Don't just say ""I'm going to quit smoking and it's going to make me a raging tool so you're all going to have to deal with me.""

Apologize preemptively instead. 

Example: ""Look, I am so sorry to do this to you guys but I've decided to quit smoking. It's something I'd like for myself. I really need your help on this because I'm afraid I'm going to be short with people and rude and obnoxious for a few days until the nicotine is out of my system and I want to say I'm sorry before it even happens. I promise I'll make it up to you when it's all over. I'll get you some lunch!""

A couple points on step one. First, be sincere in your apology. Sincerity is important. Empathize with what these folks are about to go through. Put yourself in their position and imagine someone is telling you the same thing. Second: promises of small presents or food have to be fulfilled later so keep track of that shit. It's necessary to the program to get out of asshole phase as quickly as possible, not to mention it's the right thing to do.

Step Two: Give away your cigarettes.

Don't throw them away, give them away to a smoker! It's silly to be wasteful. As soon as you've notified everybody you can think of that you're going to be a colossal fuck-head for a little while, stop with the cigarettes right then and there. Don't make a big deal about the last cigarette ever. Just stop. The sooner you get this shit over with, the better. Which means the sooner you stop, the sooner it will end.

Step Three: Be A Fucking Asshole.

This is going to suck. You're not going to like how withdrawal feels. You're going to want to punch a baby. And that's okay! Not baby punching, don't do that, but don't punish yourself for thought-crime that you can't control. You're allowed to think about the punchibility of the faces of infants.

Luckily, in Step One, you've shored up a lot of support with folks that know what you're going through, even if they're not smokers themselves. They know that it's making your uncomfortable and they know the manifestation of that discomfort. 

When you are in the company of these supportive heroes, remember to vent *to* them, not *at* them. That is to say, complain about whatever tiny things happen to be pushing you over the edge at the given moment but don't blame them or yell at them. Try to get them to understand, instead. They won't, but it's better this way.

Example of correct assholishness: ""Jesus Fucking Christ why can't they make these goddamn motherfucking cups just a TINY BIT leakproof? LOOK AT THIS SHIT. I got drips on my desk like I'm a fucking toddler. FUCK.""

Example of incorrect assholishness: ""You guys switched my fucking cup, didn't you. I have enough shit to deal with right now and you fuckers gave me the leaky one. I know somebody did because I never had fucking drips on my fucking desk before fucking this fucking morning. Fuck you.""

Also, be in mind not to take out too much aggression on people not in your circle of heroes, so to speak. If you haven't let them in on your plan, you don't get to be a dick to them. You can talk about them later or scream in your car with the windows down but don't go ape-shit at the poor sales associate at WalMart because they don't have those seasonal poptarts you liked. 

Also, be aware of people trying to take advantage of you while you're in asshole phase. Some people are *real* assholes. Every day of their lives. And some of them never smoked a day in their life, that's just how they are. These people might try to provoke you or aggravate you into saying something stupid and then punish you for it. You can prepare for such people by avoiding them when possible and bitching about them later when you can't. Being aware of them is usually enough to neutralize their threat.

Step Four: The Comedown

Okay! You're over the worst of it. It's been a few days to a week and now when you're being a dick, it's just you being a dick and not the chemical reactions inside you *making* you a dick. So you're going to find that you can stop being a dick more easily. Suddenly, you have a lot more control than you did before. 

This is the point where it all makes sense.

Unfortunately, the transition between the two states is murky and confusing. The control comes and goes. You can't quite figure out where you begin and the addiction ends for a day or so. And that's okay, too. Just keep plugging away and take out some stress by venting to your heroes same as usual until you're ready. When you feel like yourself again, you're going to think you're done.

You're going to be around a smoker and suddenly you're okay. Suddenly you don't need it. It's all good.

But you're not done yet.

Step Five: Keeping promises

Buy your co-workers some pizzas. Give a gift-certificate to a particular person that you screamed to a little too loudly. Personalize these gifts. You weren't in a fugue state the whole time, you're going to remember it all. Apologize, apologize, apologize. 

Make an effort to be conspicuously nice and kind and friendly. Let the world know it's over.

And get yourself a little something, too.

Because you fucking did it.

And now, maybe you have some special insight into the worst of your own behavior, a measuring stick by which your future actions can always be compared. You're going to have a handle on things better than most, I'd think. And you'll be better for it.

Good luck.

^1. This plan doesn't work if you're already an asshole."Cold turkey is the best. Ive recently used a good quality e cig and am down to about .4% nicotine and dropping (by cutting .8 with 0.0)"Edit: Ex- ~~smokers~~ dippers, how did you quit...?""Just don't fucking smoke. So what if it ""sucks"" for a couple weeks after you stop. Guess what else sucks? All the disease and bullshit that you cause to yourself because you're inhaling  fucking smoke. Whenever I hear someone complain about how hard it is to quit it makes them sound incredibly childish. Don't be a pussy. Suck it up  and quit, your body and everyone around you will thank you.""I realised just how much I stunk from smoking cigarettes. It really reeks.

Quit cold turkey, going from a pack a day. ""I might be late to the party, but here goes:

**Complete lifestyle change.** You smoke because it's habit. The best way to break any habit is to change the conditions surrounding that habit.

Sleep on the right side of the bed? Switch to the left. Drink coffee every morning? Switch to orange juice. Drive to work on highway 123? Take 456 instead. Always have a smoke during your break at work? Play Candy Crush instead.

When every small part of your life has been adjusted ever so slightly, your routines and habits become a bit more malleable and it because a lot easier to quit smoking.

Of course, when you do this, the worst thing you can do is continue smoking throughout. You MUST do it cold turkey. If you keep smoking, the trick won't work nearly as well the next time you try quitting.

Worked for me, hope it works for you!

Edit: formatting""What finally worked for me was to give in, go get a pack of cigarettes, take one out of the pack and smoke it, then crush the rest of the pack.  I was too poor to keep smoking like this so I was able to quit.""I took a smoking cessation class at a local teaching hospital, and that--along with an understanding partner--did the trick for me. I enjoyed learning about the nuts and bolts about addiction, and about tobacco and nicotine. It was nice, for example, to know that each craving would get weaker and weaker. It was nice to be able to taste lettuce. And it honestly made a difference to me to hear that the nicotine in once cigarette takes your body a week to metabolize, which is why people's level of nicotine builds up and up.

Finally, I totally feel you with the work break thing. Take a break anyway, you can still go outside for some fresh air. Just, you know, don't go where the smokers go!"I started doing martial arts every day. I figured if there was something that I wanted more than smoking that I would feel like shit doing if I did smoke I wouldn't be able to smoke for long before kicking it. Took about a month of getting my ass kicked before I have it up. I was going about four hours a day though so it wouldn't have worked if I didn't throw myself in head first. "I just had my two year anniversary of quitting smoking.  I finally quit by seeing a hypnotist.  I was slightly skeptical at first, but I went the the same hypnotist that helped my aunt quite 15 years earlier and my mom quite 10 years ago, so I knew her reputation and I knew it could work.  After the hypnotist session it was still a battle of will to not smoke, but it worked!""

I tried everything. I and my GF quit on the way home after taking care of a very nice man with are nasty illness from smoking.   I don't think I really wanted to quit before then. Once I really did it was pretty strait forward.  

I also work in health filed. I started just telling people I needed a break and guess what they covered me. Strange isn't it. Just don't go around the smokers on a break if you can.    ""Smoked for 28 years tried to quit many, many times.  What finally worked was Chantix and Nicotine gum at the same time.  Also played a lot of violent video games for the first few weeks. 
"I smoked a pack a day for 15 years. I was tired of smoking and wanted to quit. I got Chantix and it worked perfectly for me. April will be 3 years smoke free! The most important part is I wanted to quit. If you don't want to you're not going to."When my newly pregnant wife came to me and said..... 

""I don't want you to die of cancer or emphysema and have our child watch you go through that""...... 

I said, ""ok, it's time"".  I had been a pack a day smoker for 10 years at that point.

I pretty much quit cold turkey.  My doctor gave me a months worth of Welbutrin to help with any anxiety.  

There is no magic bullet.  You need to just want to quit.  I've never met a person who used the patch or e-cigarette and stop smoking.  They all go back to regular cigarettes.

You literally just have to stop and then fight the urge.  Eventually you body with withdraw from the nicotine and then things get a bit easier each week once that happens.  

It's been almost 10 years since I quit and I find smoking absolutely fucking disgusting.  To this day I have no idea how my wife could stand to kiss me when I would smoke?  I couldn't imagine how that could have tasted.  "I actually used weed to help me quit smoking tobacco.  "Ecigs. Started a year ago. the cheapo gas station things that look like cigarettes were total crap, so I moved up to the slightly more advanced vapor devices, and then analog ciagrets were this highly disgusting thing, a cigarette compared to an evapor device is like eating poop compared to a Brazilian steak house. I quit within 4 days of starting. 

Its been a year, I have not touched a cigarette, and the vapor/ecig has helped me ween down the nicotine without snapping someones head off while i'm driving.""Non disposable, nicotine E-Cigs. I bought one after new years because i wanted to cut down. after 4 weeks i barely have a craving. same thing happened to two of my friends. (i know it says you've tried them, but for others searching for help, they worked for me.)
"I wanted to quit before I developed cancer or any long term ailments and just did it without announcing it to the world like a self righteous douche..cigarettes that is. All it took was me waking up in a panic with my throat closed. I couldn't breathe for almost 30 minutes. It took something physically happening. I tried plenty of things as well. Cold turkey though."I am one month off cigs.. I had a really bad asthma attack and chest infection at new years and decided enough was enough. I just threw my cigarettes away and got an e-cig... make sure you stick with it, vape often and have a high nicotine content to start.. I have had my share of bad days but stuck with it regardless. Make sure you have people around you who will stop you.. it helps. Quitting really does suck but when you realise that you are not coughing anymore, can breathe easier and last longer at the gym or exercising in general, it is worth it! You can do this!! ""You have to want to, meaning for yourself, not just bc you know that rationally it's bad for you. I mean hate it, hate yourself for it, be terrified of dying an agonizing death from lung cancer, etc. When I was a teen/young adult, I didn't get it. I knew it was bad bc, well, science and facts, but I felt no consequences personally- yet. It didn't effect my health, I worked with & hung out with mostly smokers, and I just enjoyed smoking. After about 7-8 years of it, I started coughing every morning, experienced shortness of breath, and was around more non-smokers which made me more aware of how I smelled. Something I did to fit in socially was now ostracizing me. I started dating a non-smoker who never made me feel bad about smoking, but served as a reflection of how self-conscious I was about it myself, which I had never been shown until then. I was paranoid about how I smelled, tasted, looked smoking, aware of how out of breath I was just walking stairs. I realized I didn't enjoy it anymore. I hated it and hated myself for it. Once I experienced that level of self-loathing, cigarettes became the enemy and I quit cold turkey. I have one every few months or so when I'm tempted at a bar with friends, but it basically serves as a reminder of how much I don't wanna start smoking again. "Pneumonia "E-Cig.. works well enough to satisfy the initial craving, but sucks so  much that you get the point where you realize it's not worth carrying around with you.""VAPING
No question about it. I have tried quitting many times. I simply could not do it. I loathed smoking. I smoked for 20 years, and have been cigarette free for a year now.

Edit: I see all these posts about Will Power, and Cold Turkey. I soo wish that was me. If it were not for vaping, i'd still be smoking and hating it."This wont be the most popular post but I tried getting my mom to stop by resricting her from buying cigarettes. Her argument for continuing was that cancer wouldent come back to her. I even tried telling The gas stations to not sell to her. Needless to say it did NOT work. "Cold turkey worked for me. I smoked for 25 years and tried to quit with gum, patches etc over the years with no success. One day I just had enough and made my brain think that it was an awful habit that I hated. I barely had any withdrawl symptoms once I made up my mind that I was never putting another cig in my mouth. Within a couple of weeks I was able to be around other people smoking and not care. I've been smoke-free for nearly six years and have no interest in ever starting again.""No one tried Swedish Snus (rhymes with loose and goose)? There are quite a few studies detailing that Swedish Snus is a lot more effective than say, nicotine gum or patches. This is because it offers a higher amount of nicotine and is a hell of a lot cheaper. Also, it is pasteurized, so virtually no carcinogens. Please note, I'm talking about real SWEDISH SNUS (Like General and Thunder), not the fake American garbage.""You need to give yourself a reason not to smoke. For me, I replaced smoking with exercise. I started training mixed martial arts and entering grappling tournaments. I used a nicotine patch for the first 7 days then completely took my body off nicotine and didn't look back. I got so addicted to exercise that now I couldn't imagine myself smoking again because it would slow me down in the gym. All of the times I tried to quit and then failed was because the only change I made in my lifestyle/routine was taking out the cigs. I still drove the same way to work, still had the same daily routine, still had my morning coffee. I didn't change anything but smoking so everything I did made me want to smoke because smoking was associated with everything I did. I had to change my entire lifestyle. After I made changes though I was able to stay not smoking. Also, get an app that tracks the amount of money you save and look at it daily. I quit smoking 343 days ago and I have saved 2,613.34. "My mom used to smoke a pack a day when she was younger. She watched her dad go through terminal lung cancer. She quit the day he was diagnosed and never looked back. She also said she'd kick my ass if she ever saw me with a cig. Never touched em"I have been off cigarettes for 8 months so far. This is my 3rd attempt going cold turkey. This has always been the best method for me and what I have had the most success with, both previous attempts I was smoke free for about year respectively. I am 7months into this so far, I have changed my habits drastically this time around because I had a scare where I couldn't breathe well in the morning and I had a pain in my left lower lobe. I stopped hanging out with smokers, I took up distance running, quit booze and coffee, and learned a controlled breathing technique to destress. Keeping busy is the best way if your to busy thinking about other stuff you are to busy to smoke. Its a dedicated lifestyle change you have to realize that you have to change the way you do and view this so that you are in control not your cigarette.""I was sick of smoking, the smell, the money spent, the potential deadly illness looming over me with every cough, so I set a date and time (October 18th 2005 at 8.p.m.) had my last cigarette, put it out and went cold turkey. It worked.""Chantix. Though I stopped taking it when I started having all of the horrible side-affects they talk about (~2 months). By that time I had enough time behind me of not smoking that I didnt want to turn back. Its hard but a year later, Im happy I did it. "My dad quit from the moment he found out that he was going to have lung cancer if he continued to smoke. He was pretty lucky he found out early. I think he hasn't smoked since 2005.Nicotine poisoning helpsI watched my father in law struggle for breath with emphysema for years before he died.  It was horrible.  "I tapered off, over the course of several years.  Mostly, one day I realized that I was more out of breath and sick more often than I should be.  I cut way back, smoking less and less often.  I only smoked outside, refusing to smoke in my home or in my car.

Eventually, I had dropped down to smoking so rarely (a pack a week) that I found I could go days without having one.  I kept it at that level for several years, only smoking socially, and then only with certain friends.  

One day, I just decided to stop altogether, and had zero issues.  Just stopped buying, and stopped asking to bum a smoke.  I have not smoked since.""I thought about dying before my husband and him having to live without me. I couldn't do that to him.

I'm aware something else could always happen, but if I died of something that I could have prevented - I don't think I could forgive myself.

I just quit straight up. I had an e-cig for when I went out with people who didn't smoke, it made things a bit more pleasant for them. I bought nicotine gum in preparation, but I ended up only using two pieces. I chewed a lot of regular gum (those ziplock baggy refills for those big plastic gum containers are a godsend), I walked a lot, I had to change a lot of habits. But I did it.

I'm not going to lie, I still crave them sometimes. My muscles tense up when I smell the smoke when I'm out and about. When I watch tv and someone is smoking, I fight the familiar feeling of wanting to light up too. I just remember the promise I made to myself. I remember the days I've gone without, and that if I smoke I'm back to day one.""My wife and I both quit at the same time by getting sick at about the same time. I got sick, bronchial then she got the same a few days later --- we were both sick for a couple of weeks and didn't smoke during that time; it really got us over the hump... that was about 2.5 yrs ago .. haven't went back ... its great!"I liked my bike (bicycle not motorcycle) more than I liked smoking. Only Allen Carr"My girlfriend. She never asked me to stop or gave me a hard time about it but she hated that I did.

I figured I could carry on being a dick or man up and improve my relationship, my health, my financial situation and my hygiene. No brainer""It wad a few things. My grandma died when I was probably around 15 due to lung cancer and complications from smoking. I started smoking at the age of 14, both my parents smoked. A few years later my dad finally quit. Then my grandpa started getting sick and he moved in with my parents. The doctors said he had the worst case of emphysema they had ever seen. During this time my mom was told she should be using oxygen while she slept. The one day I will never forget is when my dad told me (while crying) that he was scared he was going to outlive both me and my mom because if our heavy smoking.

I had tried to quit several times before that but I guess I didn't want it that bad. 6yrs ago I decided I was done and I just quit. It helped that you couldn't smoke inside places like bars anymore. It also helped that a pack of smokes were over $5 a pack. 

My grandpa died last year partially due to complications from smoking for 50+ yrs. I'm still trying to convince my mom to quit, but I don't think that will happen. I didn't use the gum or patches, I just slept a lot and ate.

It's awesome to not wake up coughing stuff up. My sense of smell is better and everything tastes ten times better. Plus, I don't smell stale smoke all the time.""I quit by accident.  A month long bout of bronchitis worked for me.  It hurt to breath, smoking was out of the question.  By the time i was healthy again I was no longer a smoker.  Pretty amazing actually.  ""[Bupropion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion), an antidepressant also used as a smoking cessation aid. I was taking it for depression, but it made smoking less pleasurable and reduced cravings until I finished a pack and couldn't be bothered to get more.""i started recording how much money i was spending on smokes.  after a month i went online and looked at what i could have bought that month instead of smoking.

good luck, quitting smoking was what made me REALLY understand ""there is no try, only do""""Changing my viewpoint from ""quitting smoking"" to ""not starting smoking"".""I just decided to quit, and i finally did it.  It's only been a week and a half right now so i decided i would go to VaporPhoxxe and get an e-cig and some Juice.  Its not what you would think of a normal e-cig.  Its more like a hookah.


You can get whatever you want for the nicotine amount.  I got 0 because i just wanted something for when my friends went outside to smoke.  Other than that i just stopped.


Will power and actually wanting to quit is all you really need!"you gotta want to quit and plus you gotta stay away from other smokers. i think that's the biggest factor. it's very difficult to quit when you still hang out with smokers. "I heard a guy on CBC radio saying that quitting smoking is like being voluntarily sick -- really sick, like with the flu -- for nine days. After nine days, you start feeling better. I've been sick for nine days, so I decided I could do that. Every day, several times every day, I would tell myself ""Only eight days...only seven days...."" 

At the end of nine days, I did feel better. I'd coughed up a boatload of crap, and I looked forward to better and better lung function. 

Through all of it, for a year or more, I would do deep breathing exercises. I felt like that deep breathing was something I did when I smoked, so I continued with that part of the habit. 

Finally, when I felt a terrible urge to smoke, I would tell myself that if I still felt that way in ten minutes, I could, honest to god, go ahead and have a cigarette. A few minutes of deep breathing, and in ten minutes, I genuinely didn't crave a cigarette any more. Repeat 27 times a day. It never failed me. After ten minutes, I no longer craved a cigarette. 

Once the worst of it was over, I realized that it was so hard, I probably couldn't ever do it again. So I never, ever touched a cigarette again. That was over 20 years ago. I had smoked for 16 years and was up to about a pack a day. 

I had a boss who smoked about ten years later, and he liked to take me with him on his smoke breaks so we could chat. I loved standing down- wind of him, because I did, and still do, love the smell of cigarettes. Weird, I know. 

No gum. No patch. No hypnosis. No e-cigarette. Just preparing myself to be sick for nine days, deep breathing, and promising myself a cigarette in ten minutes if I really wanted one. 

However you do it, good luck!"I got the flu for the first time ever. It's been almost 6 years now and I had been smoking for over 10 years. I remember being so sick and not being able to move or hardly breathe because I was coughing so much. The thought of getting up and smoking (we smoked outside) just didn't appeal to me so I quit. "1) wait until you get ill and have no desire to smoke
2) use the time you didn't smoke (2-3 days) as a kickstarter
3) profit""I had wanted to quit for several years, but I have bipolar and severe anxiety and I couldn't figure out how to quit without it being so stressful that I end up in a mental hospital. So I kept smoking, and I smoked a pack a day and I did it for 27 years. Last year I started going to the gym (I have lost 150 pounds and am on a quest for perfect health) and I got a free lesson with the trainer and I LOVED IT SO MUCH and I went to my parents (I live with them, they control my money) and I told them I wanted a personal trainer but it is $120 a month and my parents told me if I can find the money in my personal budget, then I can keep going to the trainer and wouldn't you know it, SMOKING FUCKING CIGS cost $120 a month and I sat there and I contemplated it, and I realized that if I had a CONCRETE REASON to quit smoking, something nearly TANGIBLE I could do it and so that day, I made the choice, and I chose my trainer instead. I quit smoking a couple of days later when my carton ran out. I just decided it was time to stop, and I did.

LET ME TELL YOU IT SUCKED BIG TIME - quitting cold turkey is HORRIBLE and the nicotine withdrawals were AWFUL - I got physically sick (I ended up with bronchitis), I gained 15 pounds nearly overnight, I got HORRIBLE insomnia, I became SO ANGRY and I came about THIS CLOSE to listening to my shrink and checking myself in to the psych hospital for a couple of weeks and do it under heavy drugs, BUT I PERSEVERED and I managed it and it has been SEVENTY-THREE days now and I am NEVER going back. NEVER.

It can be done! Even someone liked me who smoked for 27 years, from the time I was 12 years old. I have not known how to be an adult without smoking. I had to dump a WHOLE LOT of bad habits and overall the entire process has made me healthier.

Working out REALLY HELPED - I poured myself into the gym and hydrated really well and exercised every day and the physical addiction went away after about 10 days, and then all I was left was the psychological addiction, which was tougher.

The day I quit smoking, I arranged for a full detail of my car and a complete interior shampooing, and that removed the smoke smell from my car so I didn't have to drive and smell it. I also stayed away from smokers for about a month.

Good luck! You can do it!"[deleted]"While certainly better for you, you have *not* quit ""smoking""."I never had to have a cigarette. I smoked communally and bought only 10 or so packs ever myself. I just decided to stop smoking when I drank.

Perseverance that I never STOPPED trying to quit even when I failed, and having a supporting caring friend (Now girlfriend) who was threatening to stop talking to me if I didn't. 

I quit smoking 1 year ago now. So just don't give up, if you stumble and fall, pick yourself up again and try again. Have a support for yourself, maybe quit with someone else too. My mom quit when she found out I had quit and she hasn't had any since either.""I've already seen this a few times in here, but I made the decision that I wasn't going to let anything stop me from quitting. It's been 6 years since I quit.

At work, I'd go out for break like I was going to smoke, but took a 10 minute walk instead. Just something to get my mind off work and smoking. 

I had a couple slip ups here and there when I was drunk, but once I made up my mind to stop, I never bought another pack and roughed it out. After a couple months, smoking starts to taste terrible and make you nauseas and you can't remember why you started in the first place.

I woke up and took an shower and realized there was this terrible smell, and I couldn't figure out what it was. I realized it was my clothes and they smelled horrible. I did my laundry and never smoked again.  That will be 6 years ago this March.  My fiancÌ© also used Chantix. She's been smoke free for 1 year and 8 months."I don't buy packs of cigs anymore. It has worked so far. If you tell yourself no it's pretty damn easy. "I got really sick. I figured I was going to quit anyway, might as well stop while I'm sick so I can get over it faster. ""Not ideal, but I got bronchitis and was so sick that I couldn't inhale smoke for a week and a half. After that it was smooth sailing. I had wanted to quit, so that bout of bronchitis was a blessing in disguise.""Moving to New York. $12 a pack here. I can't afford that shit.

Edit: Also, I quit cold turkey.""E-cigs did. Still get nicotine, without all the carcinogens. It's not nicotine free, but I sure sleep and breathe a lot better.""Big smoker since  the  13 yo,  the  last year  my wife tell me i have to quit it or lost her, so i  take  her, one month later she is pregnant... that pregnacy test make me rethink all my life... i want to be there with muy daughter in  her graduation,her wedding... dunno  just be there... and that was more powerful that nothing in the  world""I tried to quit multiple times, my trigger was also work.  I would smoke during breaks at work but never on weekends or in the evenings.  I smoked about a pack a week for 6-7 years.  I decided to quit when I had kids, because I want to be around when they're old. 

Ive quit for 2 years now, and I used the Nicorette Quickmist spray.  

Unfortunately I am now addicted to the spray! but at least it doesn't have all the horrible parts of smoking and is just nicotine, which according to the internet is not that bad for you.

In Canada you get free smoking secession(?) classes, which I took, and were very helpful.  Ask your doctor about them, they are really eye opening.

The Nicorette spray is really great.  Patches take hours to work, Drugs like Champex fuck with your head, Gum and Lozenges take upwards of an hour to be really effective.  The spray works in 60s.  It destroys cravings.  

TL:DR Use this it's awesome, and really helped me; [QUICKMIST](http://www.nicorette.ca/products/quickmist)"I used electronic one it helped I had a mix of nicotine and nicotine free things for it and mixed them up so I didn't know when it was real or not that helped but the only thing that made me quit properly was getting pregnant "Chantix was the first step for me.   But I used it and went back to smoking previously so it was Chantix and the decision that I couldn't even have one cigarette.  Not one while drinking, or when I've had a bad day, or when I extra stressed.   With me, one leads to a pack, which leads to two packs a day.""I quit cold turkey about three or four times.  Never tried patches or gums or any other substitutes.

Didn't stick until my doctor told me about Allen Carr's book.  I read a review on it, and that was enough.  Paraphrasing - Smoking doesn't alleviate stress, it alleviates the stress of nicotine withdrawal.

As for OP's job - only getting a break if you need to smoke...  Every time you need to, step outside for a ""fresh air break"".  Your employer can't stop those breaks if they're giving smokers smoke breaks.""There's no tricks OP, it's just will power. My cousin decided that one day he wasn't going to smoke anymore and hasn't ever since. That's it. No patch, no e cigs, no books. Just straight up stepping up and quitting. That's it. It's all will power OP, and I believe in you. All you have to do is not buy another pack""I smoked way, way too many cigarettes while... quite inebriated... at a Major Lazer concert, felt absolutely disgusting the next day, haven't touched a cig since.""Motivation. Pregnancy, to be precise.

It only takes a couple of weeks. You can do it.""Wanting to quit + Chantix.

The way they help you quit is by letting you taper off at your own pace, e-liquid comes in varying nicotine strengths (24, 12, 6 and 0 mg usually) and when you order juice you just lower the concentration a tiny amount every time. Many people don't notice the lack of nicotine until they're at 0mg. The nice thing about it is that there's a substantial throat hit, and the act of inhaling and exhaling helps a lot of people, I'm late for class right now and typing on my mobile but give /r/ecig a look through there's a lot of resources on the sidebar if your interested.""Has anyone ever tried smoking but it just doesnt work for them? I've bought packs but to be honest it just never got to me, maybe I smoke too much weed to enjoy it but I cant even smoke a cig stoned its just too much work to me, I'll maybe smoke a cig while drinking with friends.""Actually wanting to quit for health reasons. 

I realized, wow, Im gonna make my health 10X worse 10X faster if I kept inhaling tar into my lungs. ""I tried the gum, patches, inhaler and just about everything but the pills.  Absolutely nothing worked for me. 

I smoked nearly 2 packs a day for over 20 years.  What did it in the end, was simply NOT SMOKING.  Every little bit of nicotine you introduce into your system is a step backwards.  Every ""stop smoking"" aid that includes nicotine will make it **harder** for you to quit.

Any aid you use including pills will not prepare you for life without cigarettes and nicotine.  The only thing that will prepare you properly, is simply not consuming any form of nicotine. 

Nicotine is the reason you are addicted, and you need to train your body to survive without it.  People that tell you it's over after a few days, or a few weeks have never quit a serious smoking habit.

For me, it took 2 to 3 months before I started feeling normal.  During that time, I had everything from congestion, cough, black shit coming out of my lungs, to diarrhea.  My body hated me so much, that I'll never touch another cigarette simply so I **never have to go through the withdrawl again.**

So man/woman up, stop smoking the damn things completely.  Don't look for a crutch that will help you.  Learn to live your life without them, and when you do quit?  You'll stay quit with no relapses. 

It will be 3 years for me as of March 1st, 2014.  Zero relapses.  "I quit out of spite cold turkey because all my friends were doing it and stayed because I forgot what pineapple smelled and tasted like. mmmmmm!"I grabbed my pack, looked at it, said ""Naw"", and haven't touched it since.""I tried quitting cold turkey a few times, and something always drew me back into smoking. Boredom, stress, depression, being drunk, etc.

Late last year I decided to invest a little money in an e-cig setup. I started with a $15 tankomizer kit with 24mg/ml nicotine juice. I've upgraded my setup a little to a pyrex/stainless steel tank with a bigger battery, and lowered my nicotine level to 16mg/ml.

I've smoked one or two cigarettes since switching over, and they just seem gross to me now. I'm effectively lowering my nicotine consumption, and saving a LOT of money. My lung capacity has improved, I feel like I have more energy, and I don't stink like an ashtray.

If quitting cold turkey works for you, more power to you. But a lot of people aren't as strong-willed as you are. If you've tried quitting and failed, do the research and see if an e-cig could help you.""Not me, but friends and family have gone to this man in Massachusetts:

He went to hospital for a few days with something called [Pleurisy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurisy), and was in so much pain that no matter how much morphine he was given he was still buckling over and crying out. 3 weeks later and can still hardly breath without being in pain and is loaded up on meds. He still smokes his E-cigarette, but that's still better than the real thing and sort of fair enough seeing as he's been smoking heavily since he was 16 (he's 60 now). That pain (or fear of it?) is something that you could use as motivation. He had a heart attack two years ago and said the pain there was like nothing compared to the pain he had recently.""I accidentally found the best way, but it involves spending your free time in a much different way. I used to smoke mostly out of boredom because my life allowed for it. Then I began running, swimming, and calisthenics. I wanted to be able to run 10 miles at a time, swim 1-5 miles whenever I felt like it, and did hundreds of push-ups, pull-ups, and sit-ups per day (stayed away from the weights pretty much). Slowly, I just stopped craving cigarettes more and more, and eventually just lost my appetite for them. It was almost like smoking quit me. And this was *after* being a smoker for 10 years.

I smoked Marlboro Reds for 18 years.  Spent $30 for a months supply of the pills.  After they ran out, I didn't buy any more smokes.  Almost 2 years without them.  I was dating a smoker when I quit, she could smoke around me and I had NO desire.  Loved my experience with that drug, although I have heard tons of horror stories.""Smoked for seven years, quit cold turkey after my little sister started having breathing problems. She was having an allergic reaction to being around cigarette smoke. I decided that I cared more about my family than the stress release that came with smoking. Decided to address my stress and anxiety in other ways than smoking, went to therapy and got on medication. Went to non-smoking bars and restaurants. When friends got up to go smoke outside, I did NOT walk outside. You walk outside, especially when you're drinking and you will smoke. Stay at the table, even if it means sitting alone. 

Also, don't hang out with friends who won't support your decision to stop smoking. I knew a guy who would ask if I wanted one every five minutes even though he knew I was trying to quit. Screw those people, they want you to fail because they aren't willing to try. If you hang out with smokers, make it clear that you are an ex-smoker and do not want to be offered cigarettes. When you stop at a gas station, pay at the pump. Do not go inside. 

Basically, I had to change a lot of daily habits and go out of my way to avoid places I'd be tempted to smoke or buy cigarettes. But after five years of not smoking, it is so worth it. ""tl:dr- Cold Turkey and Fear

I went on the patch, had a bunch of phone calls back and forth and I'm now smoke free for 1 year and 30 weeks.

I had started working out and running more and was tired of coughing and being out of breath.  I also found that gum and sunflower seeds helped with the really bad cravings"Quitting smoking was a mental behavior that I took on. I committed myself to hating it, as well as I identified cravings as cravings. When you're smoking or trying to quit, you convince yourself that you actually want to smoke. I paid attention to the thought process and eliminated it.""I decided to quit, it is not as hard as people say it is.""Once a week, I smoke a cigar. No inhaling though!""I'm 19 now and smoked 20 a day for the last 5 years (bad, believe me I know) and I recently stopped using an eCig. After a day or 2 using it I had absolutely no craving to smoke. I've now stopped for around 2 months and I hardly used the eCig anymore. It was the best thing I ever did.""Realize that only the first 3 days are physiological and the everything after that is psychological. After you get over the physiological hump, manage your anxiety and stress levels. This is what will trigger you. Also when you drink don't get buzzed. Just have a drink, then maybe another in a few hours. You can start to drink more when you can trust yourself not to smoke."i used ecigs. i was a 30+ a day smoker and bought a ego brand ecig as a bit of a gag. i started using it and just enjoyed the flavor then i would go outside to smoke a cig. the thing is i found after using my ecig ciggarettes tasted awful. i continued anyway till one day i realised i had only smoked 5 cigs a day at that point i just desided to stop buying cigarettes and use my ecig instead. while on the ecig i just changed my nicotine levels lower and lower just as an experiment and found i didnt get huge cravings cause i will had the hand to mouth habbit of vaping. down to 5mg nicotine level now which is next to nothing really depending on how often you vape."A desire to quit that coincided with a bad case of pneumonia.

I recently quit because of the weather here in Chicago. I went though a pack of cigarette in the last 2 weeks because it was to cold to go outside to smoke! Maybe go somewhere that it is -40F outside and try to smoke outside...ya..you will quit."I used the patch.  It took about three tries.  The e-cog thing looks, to me anyway, like it reinforces all the triggers that make you want to smoke for real.  With the patch, you're not nix-fitting, and all the other cues to smoke are eliminated.  I tried the gum, but it didn't work.  And, if you're going to use an aid to quit, follow the directions *to the letter*.  And don't worry about getting addicted to patches or gum, they are both better then smoking.""Easy way to quit smoking by alan carr!

No substantial side-effects for me, although I have read that others were not as fortunate.

tl;dr asthma""It sounds stupid, but I read that Alan Carr book. I think there were a couple of things that particularly resonated with me - realizing that there is no ""one cigarette"" for you as an addict, getting to know the ""boredom-emptyness"" trigger and realizing that the you don't actually lose anything , but smoking itself is like walking in shoes several sizes too small just to take them off for a short moment of satisfaction. ""I know it sounds stupid after trying everything even hypnosis, reading this book by Allen Carr called The Easy Way to Quit Smoking was life changing. It really was easy.

"Stopping"Chantix, coupled with surgery to remove my Gall Bladder, coupled with anti-depressants.

I'm not sure why, but during recovery of my surgery I did not crave a smoke at all.  It was weird, because since I was recovering at my parent's house, and I *never* smoked around them, so I had a sort of learned response.

I had just gone on anti-depressants, so the ""what's the point of quitting, I'm going to die anyway so might as well"" wasn't really at the front of my mind and I wasn't always in a bad mood.

The Chantix helped a lot, and I got fortunate in not having a lot of the side effects that were reported with it.

So...most likely I attribute quitting to a combination of the three.  Note I had tried several times before; quit by location, quit by time, cold turkey, patches, etc etc.  I think that I finally quit my seventh time?  So it takes a lot of time.

Sometimes mindfulness helped if I ever did have cravings.  Chantix I think allowed me to help out with that.

In short op, it's not easy or fun, but keep at it, it took me many times to finally give it up.  You just have to find the right combination of situations/quitting aids/mindset that's right for you.  

For the record, I also decided I wanted to quit years before I actually did it successfully.

Sleeping was hard the first few weeks, but once you get over that, the differences in almost everything are amazing. Also, I live in Canada and cigarettes are around $12 a pack... that was a huge disincentive as well. Hope this helps."ChantexChantix. I quit for a year.

But recently I quit smoking cigarettes and that was a combination of having a child and motivation one thing I found helpful was to be far away from anyone that smoked that I knew every time I was around them when I attempted to quit I would start up again. If you truly and honesty want to quit cold turkey than it's all self motivation and outing yourself I.

I did have one slip after I'd quit carrying that open pack with me. I was at a friend's house. They were out, but I grabbed a butt out of the ashtray and lit it up. It was horrible. After that, I told myself I didn't want what a cigarette would taste like now, I wanted what it used to taste like before I'd quit. I know that sounds weird, but it really did work in my head.

To stop smoking I took up chewing. For me, it was easier to quit chewing than smoking. Now I used Sunflower seeds to quit chewing.  Now sunflower seeds in your cheek feels a like chewing from there it was easy. Now the problem with quitting smoking is I associated lots of social activities with smoking.

One day i got very drunk with some friends and decided to smoke a cig. About 2 months later i was back to close to a pack a day. After a couple of years I realized that i had to quit. If I didn't it wold be the early death of me. I also knew that i could never casually smoke again. I bought the patch and havent smoked in over 3 years. If you really want to quit, the patch works great but you really have to want to stop smoking."The flu. Four days of feeling like total shit helped me quit both smoking and drinking. Best thing to ever happen to me."This is going to sound like I'm being a smart ass but this is truly what worked for me: I stopped buying cigarettes.  After numerous attempts using numerous methods including gums, patches, etc. I just ran out of smokes one day and was too damn lazy to go buy more.  Days passed, then a week, then two and that was that.  I can't really explain it, it just worked."My new gf. Sex or smoke. Wasn't that hard. No patches or anything. :)"Not me, my best friend took chantix and has had great success with it. Also, he was very dedicated to the cause, and the insane nightmares are kinda fun to talk about, both of us being metal heads and crave all things darks and brutals. ""Smoking ULTRA LIGHTS (camel) right before I quit. Truth is, my friend said that was how he quit so I did that too. Now I know it was me that just wanted to quit. I quit because I wanted to. ""I switched to e-cigs for about a week and then I was gonna go camping. I got some mushrooms and a fresh e cig and showed up at the camp site. People kept askin me to bum cigarettes and I just felt so lame with my e cig that it helped me disconnect from it. I started trippin and lost track of how fast I was smokin that e cig that when I ran out 2 hours later, no one had cigs and I just like got over it. Woke up the next day and haven't looked back. (You gotta want to quit though)

""Nicotine gum.  I made quitting smoking a huge thing in my mind.  But using nicotine gum, and following the directions, it was actually pretty easy.""I quit pretty much cold turkey, but I used those flavored toothpicks to curb the mental habit. So, whenever I had a craving for a cigarette, I would go outside and ""have a toothpick"" and basically chew on it until it was unchewable. 

I think the thing I liked most about smoking was they break it allows you from whatever you're doing. And this way, I still get a break, but no cigarettes are smoked.""Most important thing is you have to really want to quit, along with realizing that you're going to lose those breaks. I used the patch, with many failed attempts. The toughest part for me was getting off the patch completely. So I went to a hypnotist while I was on the last step of the patch, took it off before the session and haven't smoked in 4 years. I hate the fact that smokers get breaks, but it's just something in life you gotta deal with.""Quitters, Inc.""I asked my girlfriend if she wanted me to quit, she said yes so I did. I switched to nicorette sticks, which really worked! However, I did put on a lot of weight.

If you really want to quit, just do it. It might seem hard at the start, but after a few weeks/months the cravings get less strong and you start to feel better and forget about cigarettes... until you have a beer or five.""Chantix. I took it for 3 weeks. To this day cig smoke makes me nausious.

Edit: 4 years no cigs"I wanted to be able to workout more without getting exhausted to quickly. I also hated the way i smelled and my family didn't really like it either.  So i just stopped. Just refused to smoke."I didn't try to quit, rather just paid close attention during the entire process. Buying the pack, feeling the craving, lighting up, taking the first draw, putting out the butt, feeling the after effects. Just being aware of the whole experience. After a couple of months, it just fell away. I'd smoked for 15 years and tried to quit numerous times before that.""My boyfriend and I were moving in together which meant I was going to be spending a lot more time with his beautiful 2 1/2 year old daughter. I never smoked around her and decided the day I moved in that I never wanted her to see me smoke. So I quit. 

It was the first time it wasn't difficult for me because I had a solid reason and I was dating a man that didn't smoke. No temptations. ""I haven't touched a cig for over 12 years. I stopped the second I found out I had a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in your lung).  I know this is not the route for everyone, but it sure was a wake up call for me. I didn't really have any cravings because after the PE, cigs actually scared me for awhile. "You really have to want it.  Also the patch and freezies helped me a lot.  Change up your routine at break time."I'm pretty sure the high dose of DMT I did put things into perspective. I quit cold turkey and didn't look back. After the 4th day, I had no cravings. It could've been that I started taking phenylpiracetam, too.."Nicotene gum.  I quit smoking 5 years ago.  I still chew the gum everyday and my body is very happy with this alternative.  "I used the patch, then lot's of willpower. the patch helps you get over the physical addiction, but in the end you need to really accept what it means to quit something you enjoy forever."Cold turkey + lots of coffeeE-cigarette and then weaning myself off that. "Cold turkey, instigated by a severe case of flu. Stopped when I got sick and just committed to not start again. I had smoked for years up to that point. ""After nearly 40 yrs of smoking a dozen failed attempts to quit, I finally made it! I used the patch but stayed on Step#1 for 3 months before switching to Step#2 and so on. Finally knew I was doing well when I forgot to put one on and managed to get through the day. My advice is to stay busy and keep trying...5 attempts is a great start! I'll admit, sometimes I miss smoking.... but not the smell of cigarettes!""Electronic cigarettes have saved my life. I knew that I wanted to quit but could never get over the fear of never having that crutch again. Browsing /r/electronic_cigarette helped to make the move to ecigs. It's been all roses from that point. Over three months with barely any cravings. Lowering nicotine concentration with every purchase of liquids (at 6 mg now). 

I was skeptical but it has really worked. Every crave I had was satisfied with a few hits. It's gotten to the point now where using the ecig is almost just a hobby rather than a necessity to keep me sane. Worth a try. 

/r/electronic_cigarette is a great place to get information and help picking a great starter kit with delicious juices. Good luck!""You have to WANT to quit. Not, I want to quit, but I'm addicted. I kicked the 10 year habbit on Aug 30th, 2013. Been going strong since. Not even 6 months yet, but I just wanted to breathe normally. I wanted to taste things again, I didn't want to cough crap up every morning. I didn't want to smell like cigs anymore.  I wanted my stamina and lungs back. You just have to WANT these things, more than you want a cig. You really just need to make it black and white. You are either a smoker, or you are not. Just keep telling yourself you are a non-smoker whenever the feeling arises."Ice cream. Lots and lots of ice cream. Nicorette really helped me stop. Just the disgusting taste was enough to get my my mind of smoking whenever I had a craving + deciding to stop was a home run for me. 3+ years smoke free."wellbutrin.  it is a nicotine receptor blocker, so it blocks nicotine in your brain.  it made it so smoking had no ""high"".  smoking a cigarette would just make my breath and clothes stink.  After a couple of weeks, I stopped smoking.  I was never a heavy smoker.  I smoked when drinking for a few years, but I smoked about 4 a day after I got divorced.  I tried to quit, but never could until I got on wellbutrin for anxiety/depression.""I manned the fuck up and stopped acting like a little bitch who can't quit rolled up plant leaf.

Two years clear after simply stopping; then I realised I actually really enjoyed it and could die at any moment from literally anything and thought fuck it I want to enjoy my life not live fearing everything so I smoked again, mind you I was on 25 a day and I smoke about 5-10 a day now after a two year hiatus and typically miss days because I just don't feel like it. 
""I am an example of the two aspects, behavioral vs. physical as mentioned by /u/gnujack . 

I used nicotine patches to focus myself on the behavior first and not make myself crazy all at once. Luckily I had the luxury of working at a company where I (out of 10 people) was the only addicted smoker. So my smoke breaks were an easy thing to kick when no people were asking me. It was an easy change to go for coffee or get some water or even go do something else in another room. Now for my personal life my GF smoked as much as I did, but we quit at the same time, so she wasn't pushing for it either. Now I think of it is also possible that I didn't smoke to not be the first one to back out.

So after about a month of patches I felt that I left the daily behavior and no longer felt the need to smoke on given times. During this time I was also slowly lowering the dosage of nicotine patches so when I finally thought I kicked the behavior it was time to stop using patches. Now the downside to this was that I started replacing the urge for nicotine with food, sugar and coffee, so new addictions came to light. Also: food tastes better so that's not helping either. Gained about 20k in a year because of that. But the good news is that for 2 years now I never really felt the need to smoke because I was no longer used to be smoking. That is if I'm not totally drunk....that still happens and then I smoke one or two and cough for the rest of the week.

tl;dr: change behavior while using nicotine patches, then kick nicotine desire with food""Honestly, you have to just be ready. I tried to quit a million times but the day I quit, I wasn't even trying. I just smelled someone smoking and it repulsed me. I never smoked again after that. It was just time. I know that's probably not what you wanted to hear but what I'm saying is there will come a time when your body will just be ready. ""You have to be **ready** to quit on your own. You can never just do it because it is beneficial to others or because someone else who lives with you is quitting. It has to be on your terms or you will not get through it.

I know this sounds difficult. But you will reach your moment if you already know you plan to quit.

Example: my brother quit because he got pneumonia, which forced him to stop smoking anyway. When he got better, he decided he didn't need them anymore.

Another one: My sister just kind of quit because she didn't want to rely on it anymore. Hard to explain to those who haven't quit before. But she just decided she couldn't afford the addiction and got patches. She pushed herself off over time.

My mom still can't find her niche to quit. But she wants to, therefore she will when the time comes.""I have the e-cig, but the proper one with liquids and not the one with cartridges as they're really poor. I find that I couldn't financially justify the price of a packet of 20 (around 7gbp) any more. I had been smoking for 10 years, 20 a day and this e cig has been incredible. 13gbp every 2 weeks. I don't smell. I can taste everything better. I have more money.

Still a slave to nicotine don't get me wrong, but a much lower amount (equivalent to 2 cigarettes worth a day) but everything else is just....better.

With the Ecig you have to learn how to inhale properly, when to take it etc. Also the top part is important. I didn't like the first one so I changed it. Quality really matters with the parts. 

The liquids matter too. If you skimp on price you get lower quality. Find a flavour you like and stick to it. I never smoked menthol but now I use that flavour exclusively. It allows me to associate a nice taste with the action and it allows me to also know if it's good quality by the smell.

Hope you manage it! PM me for any advice.""I didn't tell anyone. Just decided I'd see how long I could go without. As the days went by the triggers got easier and there was no pressure because nobody knew I was ""quitting"" but me. I told myself it was just an experiment.  I stayed in mostly, watched films, kept busy. Avoided other smokers for a few weeks. 
Five years later the experiment is still going... "10 year smoker here. I just stopped. Never went back again. Don't don't even have cravings. It's been 5 years since. "This web page:

[Bryan wanted you to know](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/BryanLeeCurtis.html)""I just quit. You have to want it. What helps is talking about it with as many people as possible and referring to yourself as a non smoker, rather than telling everyone you're trying to quit. 

This way you keep re - affirming to yourself that you in fact do not smoke, which will help you quit!""I wanted to quit.. This coupled with the new taxes imposed in new York state on cigarettes in 2010,  (almost $10 per pack)... I just refused to pay that so I quit cold turkey... I was smoking 2 packs a day. That's around $400 per month.. After I quit I used the money I saved and bought a brand new 2010 Camaro SS..  It's so much more fun than smoking. "Willpower"I decided to quit. 

The cost of cigarettes became too expensive. Once packs became $10+, it became obvious what a waste it was.

Nicotine chewing gum, but only because it's so fucking disgusting. Nicorette was so vile, that it was almost like taking ibogaine. After using it for a few days, it became clear that I didn't need nicotine any more."Cigarrettes. Really stops me craving."It's seriously all about your will to quit.  You have to want to.  Once you've made the ultimate decision to quit, and you can follow through, you'll be able to take those breaks and not have a smoke....Just don't tell your company you quit.

edit:  I always told myself I wouldn't smoke for 10 years.....13 years later I made the decision to quit.  I occasionally have one when I have a few drinks, but I usually regret it and get rid of it.  Haven't had a smoke because I ""need"" one in a few years and I feel great.  It's mind of matter (as cheesy as it sounds it's true).""this is my second attempt at quitting. the first one was in Jan 2012. got back smoking because I was really depressed during finals and had to pull all nighter. that was around June. I'm trying again now, haven't smoked cigarettes since Dec and still trying to keep it that way. 

the key is to let your mind think how much money you've burn by smoking cigs when you can actually use it for something else. simple as that. it works for me so far.""I quit cold turkey.

The final straw for me was while I was driving down the road, listening to a piece on NPR about lung cancer and smoking a cigarette.  The report droned on about the benefits of quitting, etc. I knew those, but damn I loved my cigarettes.

I was at a red light and the piece said something about ""those that smoke have a 65% greater chance of developing lung cancer than non-smokers.""  

I thought to myself, self, while it's true I may get cancer anyway and I may not be able to control that, I can certainly control the increase in chances by NOT smoking.

I took a drag, through my cigarette out the window (litterbug, I know) and then never smoked again. 

I hated quitting, but I haven't smoked in over 2 years and it was the best decision I ever made.

TL/DR: You need to pick the right time for you and be serious about it or you'll never actually quit.  Your inspiration has to be yours and yours alone.

Good luck to you!""I was never a heavy smoker (a pack would last a relatively long time for me), but I was accustomed to the taste, the rush and the ritual of smoking a cigarette enough that I guess I was kinda sorta a light smoker. But after I discovered weed, which not only tasted better but also transported me to a magical dimension, tobacco suddenly started to taste absolutely awful again, and I simply lost all desire to smoke cigarettes.

Then again, my biochemistry is not the same as a heavy smoker with a difficult addiction, and heavy smokers might be predisposed to go overboard with weed as well, so this is absolutely not a magic bullet solution to cigarette addiction. It's just something that happened to wean me off it.""I suddenly had the though ""this can kill you."" And it hit me like a truck. 

Soon after I gave someone I knew my newly bought packs of cigs and I threw my snus right out the window driving home from work. I haven not looked back since and have been spreading the benefits of quitting to my friends like wildfire. So far 4 close friends of mine was able to see how possible it was, and also joined the non-smokers club with me. 

The simple trick is...to NEVER have another tobacco product EVER. No hookah, no chew, no one hits, NOTHING EVER. You have to treat ""never using a tobacco product"" like the fucking bible to a christian fundamentalist. You have to want to quit, and that's easy to do...just surf the web on how bad it is for you and how likely you are to die and smell like shit from them. 

The sense of accomplishment you get from quitting is amazing. You'll know what I'm talking about when you redditers get there.

Good luck. ""**Goddamn fucking Polar Vortex.** I had no desire to go outside and deal with that shit just for a cigarette.

So it's been like.. 10 whole days, so I'm a little hesitant to tell people because I've ""quit"" so many times before (for a year once, even!) BUT I'm in the process of training for my first 5k and I can see my distance and time improving every day and I know it's because I can actually breathe now so it's a great motivator to keep running and not pick up smoking again. 

""""The Cold-Turkey, Severe Bronchitis, Cough 'Til You Puke"" method.  I had a severe case of bronchitis one year and although I tried, I just couldn't smoke because it would irritate my bronchial tract to the point of literally coughing until I puked.   I had that for about 2 weeks.  And since I had already been without a cigarette for about a week and a half, I figured I could go a full two weeks.   Two weeks turned into a month, which turned into a year, which turned into 6 years.  

Now I can't stand being around a smoker... and this is coming from someone who smoked 1-2 packs of Camels a day for 10 years. 

What I did was just keep busy... I smoked due to nervousness, or boredom, and also took any opportunity to take a break at work.  I chainsmoked like a freight train when I was home and gaming on the computer.    I needed to do constantly be doing something with my hands/mouth, to replace what I would be doing with a cigarette.  So I munched on a hell of a lot of hard candies or chewing gum.   I also chewed tobacco/dipped for a while to take the edge off (which I wouldn't recommend because it was harder to quit that than it was smoking.)   It sucked the first 6 months, but I toughed it through, and now I can't even stand cigarette smoke, and ask myself why the hell I ever smoked them.  But that's how I did it.   Not sure if that helps or not, but that's my experience.  ""I decided to quit, it's just a mental click i guess. You just have think : 'okay, i'll quit NOW'. i did that, threw my cigarettes& lighter away and stopped. 
""Two things, seperately.  One is ecigs.  Best thing I've ever decided.  They taste good (actually good, not like the way you enjoy cigarettes or scotch kind of good), they're cheap, use it in your house without stinking up the place.  Amazing stuff.

The second thing though, is what really let me quit.  I finally decided I wanted to.  All the times before that I had tried, I felt like I was being pressured into it for health reasons, or because my parents wanted me to, or whatever.  In the end, I decided it was cold out, it's expensive, so fuck it.

For the record, in my area, a two pack-a-day smoker spends $5,000/year on cigarettes alone."electronic cigarette "e-cigs.  haven't touched a cig in 6 months, and the thought of them just absolutely repulses me now.

I am on the lowest level of nicotine juice, and i don't get anywhere near the withdrawal symptoms i used to get with the cigs.

I have tried the patch, gum, chantix, cold turkey, xanax, etc.  they might work in the short term but i always fell back.  i don't see that happening now.""E-cig plus the introduction of fitness at a gym. The e-cig was rough, but after a few days I was all about it, and then the gym just made me not want to smoke at all, so quitting just sort of happened.
"Started heroin.    "Cold Turkey. Had a big birthday and decided enough was enough. After 1 month  I fasted for 3 days and lost the extra weight. Feel awesome now and quality of life is better. Remember it is an artificial need, you can tough it out if you really want it."The only way really is to make sure that u want to quit befor u even start trying #hasstopped"Don't quit. Stop.

For me, one of the biggest problems I had with quitting was that I would nic-fit and smoke again at some point. Then my brain would say something to the effect of: ""you're already a failure, you might as well smoke another.""

I found that I had to choose to stop smoking instead of quitting. Then I could choose, as an adult, to occasionally enjoy a cigarette and it didn't disrupt the cognitive story that I had stopped smoking.

The process of cutting back took some willpower for me though. I started setting little goals like: I want a cigarette now, but I'm going to wait 10 min/20 min/30 min before I actually smoke it. This helped me get a grip on controlling my habit. Not only was I stopping to think about every cigarette I smoked but I was reinforcing that I wanted to stop smoking with every cigarette. I did this for 2 weeks or so, but I found that I was smoking a LOT less at the end of it. I went to like 5 cigs a day from almost a pack a day.

My next big challenge was that first cigarette. I was smoking as soon as I got in my car in the morning on my way to work. Then I would crave a cig at regular intervals through the day, and would end up smoking 5, even with waiting, and couldn't cut back further. So, I started waiting for my first cig. First I waited till I got to the first intersection, then it was the second intersection, then the third, and so on, until I was waiting to smoke until I got to work.

Once there, I could distract myself with doing stuff, so I started setting time goals. I'm not smoking before 9am/10am/11am and so on. By the time I got to the evening, I started leaving my cigs at home. After all, not only am I not smoking, but I don't even need them as temptation.

It took me almost two months but little goals helped a lot. Today, I smoke one cig a day because my girlfriend still smokes and I like to enjoy one with her in the evening. But, I've changed my mentality and thought process to something more manageable. Now, I'm a non-smoker who enjoys a cigarette sometimes.

Three weeks of one cig a day and I don't even crave a cig during the day any more.

tl;dr - set lots of daily SMART goals: Specific. Measurable. Achievable. Realistic. Time-Bound. Make sure your daily goal has all these qualities.

Don't overreach. Smoking is addiction which is just as much mental as physical. Telling yourself you quit is opening yourself to failure. Working to stop is about proving to yourself that you're the one in control, not the cigs. 

Good luck, and let me know if there's anything I can do to help, its tough to wrap your brain around, but once you do, you'll feel fantastic.

Edit: words""I once got really disgustingly drunk, had a cigarette, and vomited the contents of my stomach up in its entirety. 

Now when I smoke I vomit. Can't even help it. Even second hand smoke makes me shudder ""My mom quite cold turkey when she was told she had emphysema.  Dad talked her into getting a second opinion and it turned out it was her asthema flaring up due to the smoking.  She hasn't touched a cigerette in 30 years.

I quick using a e-cigerette.  I was tired of feeling like shit all the time and spending three to four hundred dollars a month on cigerettes (wife quit also).  I haven't had a cigerette in 4 months and I only use the e-cigerette about once or twice a day.""I had been smoking for 5 years, 2-3 packs a week. When I started dating my wife and things began to move in a serious direction we talked about having kids eventually. I thought to myself, I don't want to be a smoker when I have children. So i quit, but I did use the lozenges. The lozenges actually helped with cravings and after I was able to be on my own without smokes orthe lozenges (1 month), I never wanted to start that habit again. I think its because the lozenges taste like what ass smells like (I don't like the taste of ass). ""To be honest, they just stopped importing my brand.  That said, I was never a pack-a-day kinda guy.  In the thick of job stress, I might have gone through two packs per week of Sampoerna Extras -- a clove-tobacco blend that I found enjoyable on every level..  They were just the thing for making a long drive more pleasant or getting that last burst of clear-headedness at the end of a long night.  However, I was already down to two packs per month, having no regular income at the time.  When Indonesian kretek-style products were swept up in the ban on ""candy"" cigarettes, I saw that as an opportunity to quit entirely.  

Nowadays, I wouldn't go back even if my favorite blend were easy to get, since I'm a heart failure patient and extremely vulnerable to smoking-related health complications.  However, the thing that did the trick for me was losing my favorite brand -- I bought a carton when I heard about the ban, and (except for two packs during a long strange trip in 2008) I haven't bought a cigarette since.  In fact, I think the last time I bummed one at a social gathering was in 2010, three years before I found out I had a failing heart.""Like others in this thread have said, you just have to do it cold turkey with willpower. Constantly remind yourself how stupid smoking is. It helped me that I got bronchitis from it and decided that bronchitis was worse than all the happiness that smoking brought me."Heart attack @ 38 worked for me.  It's been almost 6 months.  I still want one right now.  "Smoked for at least 5 years and smoked quite a lot (min. 1 pack a day).
One day I made a bicycle tour with my girlfriend and after the first hill I noticed my lungs burning and my heart beating like no tomorrow. This opened my eyes, I got afraid about the diseases you can get from smoking (cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc.).
I then decided to quit smoking immediately. I forced my Girlfriend to quit smoking too. Since then we never touched a cigarette again, this is about 8 years ago. I regret every cigarette I smoked so badly to this day. It was one of the worst things I have ever done to my body. When you realize this, quitting becomes easy... just stop!""Resolve.  No, not the carpet cleaner.  

You have to actually, truly want to quit.  If you do, then you will.  At the time my son was born I smoked a pack to a pack-and-a-half a day.  I had for a decade.  After I looked at him and held him, I knew I didn't want that shit around him.  I didn't want the disgusting smell clinging to his perfect little body or saturating his clothes.  I didn't want anything happening to me that would keep me from protecting him.  I especially didn't want to jeopardize his health without him having a say in the matter.  After we got home from the hospital I dropped half a pack of smokes in the trash and never looked back.  In that moment my mind simply said ""Nope.""  

Some people are better at controlling themselves than others.  It takes willpower.  I have that in spades.  You obviously don't.  All I can say is that I don't think you actually want to quit.  You just like the idea of quitting.  ""They key for me was pretty simple, I had to actually want to quit.  

It wasn't someone else making me quit or just telling myself I had to quit, I had to actually want to quit.  Once you quit, don't let yourself fall back into the habit, don't do the ""just one cigarette"" trick, quit and never go back.

I quit in 1979 and haven't smoked since.  It did take three tries.""Just before you light up that cigarette (literally) put it into your pocket and walk back inside. Like others have pointed out,you have to want to quite more than you want that smoke. Cognitively, just keep reminding yourself why you're quitting. Let this work as your trigger. Finally, think of the consequences of not quitting: painful death, rotting teeth, non-productive use of time etc""
Everyone seems to think cold turkey is the best. I never found it worked and honestly it's just so much strain and stress I don't know why you would do it.

I quit using the patch after trying literally everything else. The patch is by far the easiest way to quit. Yes it takes longer than cold turkey but required far less willpower.""I started smoking e-cigarettes. As I progressed I began filling them with liquid with less and less nicotine content. I think it worked because not only are you weaning yourself off you, don't smell it and want one, and it also fulfills the oral sensation of smoking. Give it a try. ""Everyone's body is different. For me,  I wasn't actually addicted in the general sense. I did enjoy it, and did feel relaxed whenever I felt stressed compared to when I didn't smoke a particular day. 

I gradually started to dislike the taste and I fixated on that which, I guess, conditioned me to eventually develop an aversion to it. 

The tipping point was while I was developing this aversion my brother showed me a video where someone simulated what kind of tar buildup is in your lungs after 300 cigarettes. Even though I was a casual smoker I knew I was smoking more than 300 a year. And what I saw completely changed me.

To OP, I really hope you get to your goal of quitting. You'll have your health AND more money in your wallet :) ""My father quit by just wanting to stop but I wonder...


is there any science to support if it is easier for men to quit smoking than women? Specifically with the ""i just dont want to smoke anymore"" method?""I stopped going inside of gas stations. I realized that 90% of the time when I had quit for a few days/weeks that I'd wind up with a pack of smokes somehow. And then I realized most of the times were when I went into a gas station to buy a drink or beer and would sit there waiting in line staring at the cigarette boxes.
""Count the hours, in which you did not smoke, the first few days are hard in generell but after you have like 2000hours of non smoking it isn't worth another cigarett anymore. What can also help you is to play around with a pencil so your hands have something to do. All in all it's just another habit. And don't say I stop in 2 weeks, stop now!"Actually wanting to quit for myself.I got sick and had a horrible cough snd sore throat. I kept smoking throughout it and my asthma started acting up. Tried smoking and started to dry heave. I've hated it ever since. Smoked for 3 years roughly. "I wanted a way to smoke in Ralph Wilson Stadium during Bills game. Got an ecig. Accidentally quit smoking completely in a couple of weeks.

These are life changing products. I absolutely can not recommend them any higher. Tried everything, then this was just... I can't even explain it. It's the best thing to happen to my health since I stupidly started smoking. My senses are back, my skin looks better and so do my teeth. I can breath again. 

Come check out reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette ""Was offered a job where smoking (any tobacco) is prohibited, and testing positive for nicotine (along with any other banned substance) will be grounds for immediately firing.  Quitting had been off/on my mind for years.  Tried a few times in various other ways (gum, patch, Rx drugs, cold turkey) but the desire to STAY QUIT from smoking was always weaker than the desire to start back up. However, with my job offering me about a 40% raise over my previous salary... it was a very strong motivator.  Health? Nah.. don't really care.  Smell better?  Eh... I was a smoker, couldn't smell much.  Gobs more money and an easier job?  Yep.  That did it.""I just stoped smoking one day, had two weeks of hard work after that but it was well worth it.""Bad shroom trip. 

""I wanted to quit for a long time. I got some medicine to help, but while taking it I had a realization. The only thing separating us from animals, is the ability to control our habits. After that, it was really easy. I get the urge occasionally but I just remember all the bad things, the smell, the taste, that morning cough and I lose interest."I just had enough. Cannot tell why but I don't want to smoke any more. I miss the feeling of the 'kick' sometimes but I really don't want to do it any more. I feel terrible when thinking about the actual process. Over years I could not resist the desire now it's disgusting to me. As said I don't know why and therefore it will probably not help others -.- (and I hope it stays the way)"Cold turkey, just cut it off completely and start exchanging the habit for something else. Also think about your health and family, support is the best type of help. If you have friends who smoke, don't be around them as much because they might push you to smoke. ""Switching to electronic cigarettes, and reducing the nicotine content gradually. Started at 18mg, then 11mg, then 8, then 5, then 3 then no nicotine. Within 3 months I was puffing nothing but flavoured vapor and I literally started to forget to smoke, so I stopped using it all together. Haven't had a puff nor craving since."Electronic cigarettes. I began because I was curious about them and didn't even want to quit at the begining. Now I'm a year tobacco free and I trade a deadly habit for a very addictive hobby that made me start learning about electricity among other things.Willpower. It's sad most people don't have it."I used gum for a short time but what i found really helpful was the thought that ""I've made
It this long, if i was to start smoking again what a waste of all that time and effort.""  It's been 10 months and alot of rough times, why negate all the work I've put in now?""E-cigarettes are ineffective and dangerous, I'll tell you that much!"I have a friend who stopped cold turkey a year ago. He had done it since he was fifteen starting with dip and smoked about three years later. Just decided he was done with it and gave em up at 22."Cold turkey, it's sucks but it what worked for me. One day I just decided that I didn't want to do it any more and I never smoke another one again. It sucked for a few weeks but when I realized how much better I felt and how much longer I could live it was worth it. Make a commitment and stick to it, no matter what!""Tenacity. You just have to try and try again. What finally got me was a case of bronchitis bad enough that I couldn't smoke for about two weeks, which helped get me over the hump, but there just had to  eventually be a day where you decide that you aren't ever going to smoke again, and then you stick to it.""This is likely to get totally buried but - I stopped one cigarette at a time. First I gave up the first smoke of the day, the one on the way to work. A few days later, the one at 10am. Then the lunchtime one. Etc.

Nicotine addiction wasn't a big deal for me, but habit was. Breaking the habit was the challenge, so I broke it step by step. Worked for me. Took about a month to stop completely. A few months after that (and still now, years later) the smell of cigarettes totally disgusts me. No way am I ever going back.

It should be noted that I didn't tell my boss I'd stopped smoking and I kept taking cigarette breaks because they did wonders for my productivity.

Giving up was the best thing I ever did. If I could go back in time and give myself a ny one piece of advice it would be a close call between ""Jenny and Sarah were totally up for a threesome at that Halloween party"" and ""don't start smoking you dumbass""""Didn't start. Bam.

Seriously though, good luck OP. Get that fucking monkey off your back!"What's currently working is that it's usually negative 5 outside and I refuse to smoke in my homeE cigs!"You are the only one who can quit.    You have to make the decision and then you will.   If you can not quit, then you have not made the decision.
Works the same for any addiction.  All the therapy, rehabs, nic patches, appetite suppressors, surgeries in the world will have ZERO effect until you make the decision and mean it.
It is not easy to hear but it is the truth and always has been.""It's simple, you make a decision and follow through with it. It will be hard, but you must fuck off your rationalisations. I'll add, you'll do 1 of 2 things. 1) replace the addiction with something else 2) get horribly depressed because whatever you were distracted from, what ever helpless self destructiveness you occupied with it starts to come through. This is why you fuck up. But, just make the decision and embrace the difficulty.""Not me - my mother

She ran out of fags on day and decided she just couldn't be bothered to get more there was no point in it. So for a few weeks she used an e-cig and had a few puffs on that once or twice a day and eventually stopped. Its the mindset of you not needing one but taking it slow and withdrawing that way.

No idea if this would help or if it will vary but worth a shot! Good luck!""Allen Carr's EasyWay (the book). Just stopped from one day to the next, without a slow period, without reducing gradually, etc. After 15 years of smoking. Started when I was 14. Smoked one to two packs of John Player Special or Benson&Hedges a day.

I'm not usually one for self-help, cultish kind of things. But the book actually worked for me. Even though I was aware of the approach it uses (a bit similar to brainwashing).""Pretend you're smoking, but bring your phone and play games on it or call someone. Give yourself those breaks if you need them.  Don't take breaks with other smokers unless you have your e-cig ready to go.  You have to start saying no to yourself.

I know it's not working for you, but the e-cig really worked for me.  It got me through that whole nicotine withdrawal phase without caving.  I know it's a bitch to make sure it's charged and ready to go and stuff, so maybe try to get another charger and bottle of liquid to keep at work so it's always on you. 

The e-cig ended up being just easy enough to use that it was there when I had cravings, but just annoying enough to avoid using constantly.  Now, I think I use mine 4 days out of the month.  I was 1/2 pack per day for 10 yrs with many failed quit attempts before that."I smoked a pack a day for 4 or 5 years. Then I tripped on mushrooms and cigarettes became extremely unappealing. Haven't had another cigarette since (8+ years ago)."What kind of ecig are you using? [Tasty Vapor](http://www.tastyvapor.us/) sells an awesome liquid called Atomic Cinnacide (think Fireball candies) and it actually gives a throat hit because of the spice, it has a thick consistency vape, and you can adjust the nicotine levels. Buy the highest nicotine level, start with that, and buy one of their doubler bottles (same flavor but with no nicotine). Over time keep cutting the nicotine levels and you should be golden. Didn't work for me, but it worked for about 6 of my friends. ""Had wisdom teeth removed.   Lots of pain killers and the fear of dry socket.  

Best thing i ever did.   Now if I can lose this weight....""I got the flu. Smoking was nearly impossible, and I didn't smoke for about a week and a half because of it. 

Then, I told everyone. *Everyone*. Kept the pressure on. 

I haven't smoked in about 2 years :)""Stop buying them and force yourself to bum. If you break down, try to buy only a single or buy a pack and give all but one away.""I smoked for about 12 years, smoking a pack a day at the end. I quit the day that my wife moved in. She wasn't going to put up with any shit and that made the decision to quit easy. There was no hiding it because she was living with me, and the temptation faded slowly. I still get the rare craving, but it's only for a minute and then it's gone. ""Getting pregnant. Stopped right away and just haven't really thought about it since I found out. I only had a max of maybe 5 cigs a day before then so maybe it made it a bit easier.

Basically I think I just needed a real reason. Before I had kind of wanted to, for money reasons etc, but nothing seemed that pressing.

I suppose it's not very practical for a lot of people though :p""Honestly the E-cig helped me quit the actually cigarettes but you can't really quit unless you really want to.  It's going to sound somewhat strange but I basically would internally almost shame myself for each cigarette until I couldn't take it anymore.  Finally after 8 years I am cigarette free, been 7 months and I haven't looked back.  You need to make sure that cigarettes are an absolute no mentally for whenever you are offered one or have the urge.""Fear.  I'm a diabetic and had a scare a few months ago ith an infection and poor blood flow to my feet so I quit... for good this time, cold turkey... maybe being in the hospital for a week not being around any tobacco helped too""Quit with someone else.  Have a support network.  When I quit I joined the newsgroup [alt.support.stop-smoking](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alt.support.stop-smoking).

Go balls in, make this the last time you will quit.""First time I joined SmokeEnders. I quit for 4 years, but relapsed. Not their fault though, I consciously decided to smoke again.

Second time, champix. Been clean for almost 3 years now. Won't ever go back because the second time was a bitch.""My GF motivated me enough to do so a couple of years ago. 
We're not together anymore but I did not smoke ever again. 
Also, I want to be healthier.""Honestly, forcing myself to stop buying packs was the key. I made sure that any time I had the urge, that I would value the money it would cost more than the pack. I still smoked socially, and would bum time to time, but over the months the desire lessened (and friends got tired of my freeloading), so I naturally lost the urge. I still like to go outside, stand in the smoker's circle and take in the smell. That's what worked for me!""I was in healthcare (EMS) and the wife (also smoked) got preggo and said I smoke she smoke....worked for little then I sneaked and got busted.

What finally worked was drinking lots and LOTS of water.  every time I got a craving I would chug 8-10oz of water. I got so sick and tired of pissing every 10 min that eventually the cravings went away.""Really wanted to quit, quit, use niquitin treatment.""Nicorette (store brand) and support of s/o. I still want tobacco everyday, 41/2 years strong though. "Vape!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"Chantix.  Didn't follow the directions though.  Took the pills as directed, but continued to smoke for about a month after starting.   At one point cigarettes stopped working for me, and I step by step cut out a ""routine"" cigaret here and there.  Then started to see how long I could go without.  Made it all day on Halloween over 3 years ago, but that was it.  I still get cravings but I know the first time I take a puff I'll be hooked, so I just don't.""i was in hospital with pneumonia. got out, bought another pack and almost died from smoking 2 cigs and then i chucked the pack. that was 6 months ago. Ive tried everything under the sun short of hypnosis to quit prior to that. the thing that helped the most was mindset and at the time i wasn't getting any satisfaction from having a cig""I haven't fully quit yet.  I'm a month out without one, but cold turkey seems to work the best.   That and now whenever I'm around smokers now I can smell them from a mile away.  It's that stench that I don't want to return to.""Planning and making the decisions that help you stay away.

In my case i waited until just a bit after my birthday (going out, friends who smoke + drinks) 
I used the patch for the first few weeks to help with the cravings (I never touched the 21mg, they would make me sick...14 mg and down to the minimum really quick)

But the biggest point was i was decided and i chose not to go hang out with my friends when 85 % were smoking in a small room... I made the conscious decision to stay away. 

Cigarettte free almost 5 years ( i smoke cigars on occasion, with no cravings at all)

My 2 cent's :D"surviving my heart attack at 40 that I had because I smoked ;-)"not everyone can just stop. i went cold turkey for somewhere around three months. then i went out drinking and one slip up was all it took. this happened a couple of times before i tried the gum, then i tried the lozenges, nothing seemed to KEEP me off them for more than a couple of months. 



then i tried e-cigs. now, i dont think they are HARMLESS...however its very obvious to me they are LESS HARMFUL. my quality of life has improved, i breath easier, i dont get sick as often and i dont smell like shit. I have been cigarette free for roughly 7 months now. i have zero craving for them, and honestly they disgust me now. i have also successfully gone from 24MG of nicotine down to 6MG of nicotine in that time, which means the vapor im using is far less powerful than smoking ever could have been, and i am not getting all the other chemical additives.

It was hard knowing that he waited to get it check out until after we had our son, because he didn't want anything to get in the way of our excitement and goodness. Couple of weeks after we had the baby he finally had it check out and he was right, it was cancer. He kicked its ass or so we thought because on a Friday after month of treatments, he was told he was Cancer free, to go to another appointment on Monday to be told it was somewhere else now. He went to the hospital because he had a cold, which is horrible for cancer patients, especially those with lung cancer,2 days later they were talk about his next treatment options, and then the next morning we were making hospice arrangement. He elected to go to the hospital hospice so he wouldn't have to put his wife though all the care he would need. It was the longest most drawn out experience I imagine a family could go through. Day 1 and 2 things are okay, his voice is week, and he is tired taking brief 2 min naps picking up conversation where he left off. Day 3 he is asleep and talking to where we cannot understand what he is saying in his sleep. A lot of rumblings about last min things he wanted down when he had passed. Day 4 he was asleep, and he never woke up. 

Now in hospice they make you comfortable, they help with pain, and help you with your body, and they feed you by mouth, once you cannot eat or drink, there are no IV tubes to feed you. So over the next 2 weeks, we watch him wither away to nothing. Every day the staff saying it could be any time now. The body does things when it is about to die. And they are hard to watch. I stopped bringing our son up there because he was young now, about 2, and it was hard. His wife never left his side for more than a few mins. he was there for almost 3 full weeks. So long so painful so drawn out. I knew i didn't want my son to see me go through that process, and so I quit, for him.

We made a bet - first one to smoke would owe the other $30. I'm a cheap-ass guy, I've been 7 years clean now. The other guy managed to quit as well.

two: Take it one day at a time. Everyone has gone 24 hours without smoking before. Its not that hard. Now when your on day six for example and you really want a cigarette just tell yourself that you can have one later if you can make it through today/this hour/this minute/whatever. Obviously, you know your lying to yourself but the point is cravings dont actually last as long as people think they do, your mind will wonder on to something else within a few minutes and you can continue living smoke free.

3: this is minor but get an app for your phone that tells you how long is been since youve smoked, how many cigs youve gone without exc. 

4: think of a meterial thing thats expensive that you want to buy, for me it was a WiiU. Now put all of the money you used to spend on cigarettes towards that item. its alot easier to keep a cigarette out of your mouth when you know specifically what your keeping yourself from buying.

5: personal opinion, electronic cigarettes are garbage, dont fuck with them, your still going through the same motions (lifting hand to mouth, inhale, hand down, exhale)as smoking   a real cigarette so your not going to break the habit. 

6: millions and millions of people have quit smoking before you, some of them quit on there own, some of them quit in caskets. which group do you want to belong to?

I've quit for over 2 years now, with only 1 slip up in the first few months. The patch and normal chewing gum are what got me through. I hated nicotine gum, so I just used regular stuff. Any time I got a craving I would pop in a piece and try not to think about it. "I actually tried the electronic cig. But only when I had a bad crave I would use it. Then eventually it became less and less . It helped me out a lot."I bought a $50 e-cig from smoker friendly with 4 different types of cartridges; high, med, low and zero (indicating nicotine levels). I started on the highs, it wasn't as good as cigs, but deep down I wanted to quit so I forced myself. Over about a month I slowly lowered the nicotine levels until I was at zero. After a week of the zeros I asked myself ""why are you still using this?"" I put it down and haven't gone back. 
I recommended this method to a few friends, 2 quit like me 1 still smokes. I guess just puffing on the zeros helped my oral fixation, which was my toughest part of quitting.

"Balls"I smoked 10 years .5- 1 pack of Malboro reds a day. For me I used the patch, the my healthcare provider sold them at the hospital pharmacy area for 18.00 compared to that nicoderm crap. The cravings only last about 5 min, and literally you can feel the nictotine come in the system to aleve. I would always carry with me carrots or some kind of snack. So I can chew play with it like a ciggerette as I ate. I would also carry around a tootpick. And then last but not least and some would disagree with me.. But smoke weed. I would smoked a bowl or two at night for that first month or so. I got the ""kick"" I wanted from the smoke, it felt like puffing on a malboro red as far as harshness.  not too mention got me high and made me kind of forget about smoking a ciggerette for a few hours. 

I havent smoked in like 7 years or so. But to this day. Sex and Mexican Food. Its like a brain trigger and I crave a cigarette after lol"I just slowly stopped.

The last time I quit cold turkey because I had just scored a date with this super awesome girl, and I didn't want to blow it over something silly like smoking. It was a struggle, but she's awesome, and looking back it was an easy thing to do for someone so great, plus it's a benefit to my health.

That aside, the first time I quit smoking is actually an interesting story. I was on the USS Abraham Lincoln, on deployment to the Middle East. My division had started a contest at the beginning I deployment, a fitness contest. Fat guys need to get thin, skinny guys try to bulk up, biggest gains/losses at the end gets bragging rights.
In the process of this contest, I went from never having worked out before in my life (we're not talking boot camp style workouts, this was the first time I took it upon myself) to being in the gym every day. I was seeing big gains for a while, but I hit a plateau. A friend recommend i try a cycle of this product called Spawn, a pro-testosterone product.
I ordered some up, and started taking The recommended dose. Boom, gains! Two weeks into the one month cycle I had run out of cigarettes, and a buddy came and asked me if I wanted to go have a smoke. It was them I realized I had been out of cigarettes for a couple of days, and it hadn't even occurred to me. It wasn't a problem. I didn't pick up another cigarette for a long time actually, until I injured myself and couldn't go to the gym for a bit.

Guess I replaced one habit with another. ""Read Allen Carr's book and join us over at /r/stopsmoking.  I'm 6.5 months into a successful Cold Turkey quit.

The book, the sub and the material at whyquit.com got me going.  Education is key, regardless of approach when you understand it becomes much easier."My boyfriend got me to quit. It was pretty corny but he told me he wouldn't ever kiss me after I smoked and that did the trick for me."People probably aren't going to like this but for me it was more a mind set than anything. I smoked half a pack a day from the age of 18 to 24. I decided that I really didn't want to any more. 
A friend sent me the pdf of allen carr's book about quitting smoking and really it's just repetitive and really helps you to think through why you are a smoker and why you want to quit.
I have had 3 cigarettes since I quit in May and each time it grosses me out so much that I remember why I quit. 
Good luck to you. I never realised how much of my time I was really spending smoking and I never realised how much more productive I could be without taking a ciggie break every hour or so. 
Make the decision, stick to it and don't back down. But if you do it's ok, each time you quit it's one step to being done forever!! "I stopped buying them. Being broke helped!"Hey, good for you for trying to quit. Honestly what helped me quit is I went on a nutritarian diet ( meaning to eat the highest amount of nutrients per calorie) and honestly eating so healthy made feel so good and prepared to quash my last vice ... Smoking. I've researched into what nutritarianism does for smoking and eating a high volume of vegetables and fruits help stop cravings and give your body the tools to heal the damage you've done. Of course I didn't do it alone with just a different lifestyle for me the routine was the hardest to shake off... I used the patch and with eating so well I could always think of the positive things I was doing for myself. There will be days that are going to be so terrible and you'll want to start again but you'll learn to not give in and keep up all the work you've done. Those days will start being less and less until you don't even think about smoking.

Yep. My wife the ex-smoker thought I was smoking something from Colorado when I met her as a smoker. I told her my father was a smoker in the 70s/80s and went to Smoke Enders.

She went out and got orange juice again.""Nicoderm CQ. My wife and I quit at the same time. 

From the first hour I was so wired from the nicotine, I didn't even really think about lighting up. Another sensation I felt, though, was it was as if I had metal coursing through my veins. At the end of the regimen, I vowed to never smoke again because I didn't want to go through quitting again.

I had the mental conversation ""this kinda sucks and is pointless, I'm doing this out of reflex more than anything"". So at that point I gave away the rest of my cigs and stopped completely. I stayed on the chantix for another month maybe, even though they say to stay on it for 6.

I think the reason why this was feasible for me was the other thing I mentioned, NA meetings. Staying on chantix for 6 months matters because it gets you accustomed to not smoking for an extended period of time, however I was able to use the tools I'd gained from staying away from other drugs and apply that to cigarettes. IE- Don't pick up the first one and you wont have the ones that follow. It's a simple concept, but for people who have been addicted to something, they know how it works. You have one, it turns out to be enjoyable and you think, okay I can do this once in awhile. It's more fun this way, once in awhile. Once in awhile turns into weekends, turns into once a day, turns into when you're stressed, turns into breaks, turns into all the time. 

The point is, once you've broken the physical part, and you've gained some time away from it completely, it becomes a choice rather than a compulsion. You learn to cope without. You stop hanging out with smokers when they're smoking(until eventually it doesn't really affect you, other than the part where you now find them disgusting to be around). 

I haven't had a butt or any tobacco product in over 5 years now. "I'm quitting February 1st so this should help. I got the flu and a cold and couldn't conceive of smoking. After a week a felt a little better and hadn't smoked so I continued not smoking. After a month I was feeling mostly human again and figured there was no reason to start up again. I had actually planned on quitting the night before with my then spouse. It worked for me but not the ex."been trying to quit for ten years now.  saved this thread.  keep up the stories and motivation, guys""I quit cold turkey in July and every single day has been a struggle. I see someone smoking and I want to ask for one. I get gas and I want to buy a pack. Even though there is an overwhelming desire to do so, I just don't, because I know how hard it is to quit a second or third time. I often lie to myself and think ""if I go through today without smoking than I can smoke tomorrow"" but when tomorrow comes I think the same thing again. For six months. ""I just decided it was bullshit and I didn't want to choke on my own lungs anymore. I medicated with Benzodiazepine for 2 weeks to keep the panic attacks down until withdrawal passed, which was hell. I also recommend constant exercising. walk 10 miles a day for the first 2 weeks of cold turkey. First time I tried to quit I ended up in bed all day, sitting around the house. That was a BIG mistake. Don't bother trying to keep your mind occupied, keep your body exhausted and you have a chance.""Probably won't help you but for me it was getting pregnant. Got horrendous morning sickness and an aversion to cigarette smoke, just walking past a smoker made me gag.

The thing that kept me off them was the health visitors who advise that any smokers who come to the house wear a 'smoking jacket' which they leave outside or don't hold the baby because the smoke residue on clothes is harmful to the baby.

It's a bit OTT but is do anything to protect my children so I have been smoke free since May 2010.

I had it easy when quitting but my advice would be find something more important than cigarettes and convince yourself it's and either/or situation.

Best of luck.""Tea Tree Oil Toothpicks... Seemed to do it for me. Gave me something to replace the smoking, though at first I was going through a pack of them every two days after a while though the cravings got less and less and I was able to quit. Stay clear of alcohol though for a little bit if you can, was my gateway right back into smoking at least for that night. ""I shat black and I thought I was dying of cancer. Turned out it was an stomach ulcer from the stress of college (Doctor said the smoking didn't help, but also didn't cause it). It took a wake up call like that to get me to quit. I also quit after around a year of 7-10 cigs a day. So it wasn't a long, intense addiction.""I decided to quit because I was starting to get more serious about cycling.  I was doing 45, 50 mile rides and struggling to finish.  I wasn't smoking much, but I needed to quit.

I decided to quit.  I knew the cravings would be difficult to deal with.  I decided that for two weeks, I would eat whatever I wanted whenever I wanted it.  I knew I would gain weight, but I knew riding would deal with that eventually.

And it worked.  I made several midnight runs to Taco Cabana for Fajita Nachos and made late calls to Pizza Hut.  The interesting part?  I gained five pounds in those two weeks.  

I also stopped going out to bars and clubs with friends for a few weeks.  Back then bars allowed smoking and I knew I would not be able to resist.  

I also started chewing gum when I would drive to and from work because it was normal to light up as I started the car.  20 years later, I still keep gum in the car.

I knew (and you do too) what it does to your lungs and your cardiovascular system.

Best of luck... ""If you continue to smoke cigarettes you WILL get cancer, and you WILL DIE. Don't assume that you're special and it won't happen to you. Don't think that you're young and have plenty of time to quit. Each puff that tastes so sweet going down is not so sweet in your body. The arsenic and other poisons are forming a blackened tar/crust that is caking your lungs. Every drag you take is making it thicker. Think of a clogged piston in your engine.


 Lung cancer is inoperable and painful. You will die prematurely and devistate your entire family. You will ruin their lives. Smoking doesn't only ruin your life, but the loved ones around you. Quit for your loved ones. You should feel horrible and guilty every time you light up. Your going to devistate your entire family because of your selfishness.


I was a smoker for 8 years. I've been clean for 4.""I picked a date and used cold turkey as well, but I feel that my ace-in-the-hole for being successful was music. I listened to a lot of darker Metal/industrial music and made any lyrics I could into my own narrative against addiction, especially any that were about some kind of enemy or nemesis. Addiction is a cruel beast, and imagining myself slicing its stranglehold from my brain made it much easier to finally kick it for good. I'm a quite cerebral person so escaping into music and my own imagination as much as possible made me slay that demon, and it's stayed dead for almost four years now.""I got out of the mindset of ""after this pack I'll quit."" It doesn't work. I had one cigarette left, and just threw it in the trash, and bought a boat load of tictacs.

It only took about 4 days for my body got used to being without nicotine. I quit on a tuesday, and Friday I felt like I wanted to kill someone. But the next day I woke up and I knew I beat it.

Don't get me wrong, I still have cravings. And other ex smokers I've talked to say I always will, but the irritability that came with being without is gone.

Just push through, my friend, all it takes is a little willpower.  Good luck.""Just don't smoke. Will be 6 years for me on June 19th (cold turkey). Not a day goes by I don't think about smoking a cigarette, but I just don't. Like all things, it gets easier with time. Plus, they kill you and make you feel like shit. And cost a lot of money!!!""Double pneumonia. After that, my lungs were not having any more smoke, period. That was about 15 years ago.

I do not recommend it as a cessation method, as effective as it may be.""I am an active smoker for 6 years now....i usually am smoking around 9-15 cigarettes during the day but my real issue is at night...usually i am drinking and im smoking 1 pack + only at night.

But for the past 6 days i've been sick and i havent light up even 1 cig so im wondering if i should actually quit when i get healthy again."Quitters Inc. "You just STOP. Period. I smoked for 10 years and that's what worked. A typical nicotine craving lasts roughly two minutes. keep getting through those two minutes and after 2 weeks you'll be free and clear. It's all about willpower. Screw all the stupid aids and patches and gum. 

 If you want it, take it."VapingGetting Anxiety at 31.  Helped me to stop drinking coffee in the morning as well lol."I smoked for almost 11 years, and it took me a good 2 years to quit.  I spent those 2 years cutting out smokes i ""didn't need"".  For example, I used to have a smoke after school, then 10 minutes later I'd have one waiting for the bus, then after an 8 minute bus ride, I'd have one on the walk home.  It was easy to cut that down to two, then to one.  I went from smoking 15 a day to 3 - 4 a day over the span of those 2 years.

The final stop was when Lent started.  I gave up smoking for Lent, and after 40 days, there was no reason to go back.

The only advice I have is to see if you can cut some out gradually.  It's a long road, and you have to want to quit.  Good luck!""Electronic cigarette worked for me.  Almost a year since I quit real cigs.  I think it helps if you get a good ecig, rather than a disposable.  Go on over to r/electronic_cigarette for tips."The e-cig. No kidding. Two weeks and I relied on it less and less until ... hey. I don't smoke. Nice."I was only able to quit when I firmly decided I really wanted to be a non-smoker.  

I wanted to quit for my 30th birthday.  Now, I did play a little psychological game with myself, because nicotine is an addiction and the idea of ""quitting"" would actually increase my urges to smoke some delicious cigarettes.  So, a little over a month before my birthday rolled around, I decided to try to go as long as I could without smoking a cigarette.  If I made it to my birthday without smoking, *then* I would quit...but I never thought of it as quitting before then.  I kept a pack of cigarettes on me the whole time, so as not to induce panic, and simply began thinking ""I'm a non-smoker"" over and over.  

The worst part was over long before my birthday, but making the conscious decision to quit 30 days after my last cig still made me antsy.  I have not so much as taken on drag off a cigarette since (seven years ago this April), but for years after, I would still panic slightly at the idea of having left my smokes somewhere.  And even now, I have ""smoking dreams"" in which I panic and think I have to quit all over again.  Ugh.""Quit with chantix once for 6 months, quit cold turkey once for six months, weaned onto an e cig over the course of a few months, and then quit nicotine altogether when I lost that."Being poor... Here in Uruguay smoke tobacco is a luxury. And I do not like weed.Three months cycle-touring. Try it. I decided I wanted to quit and took Chantix.  And I did."I used an ecig for a month or two to lessen the nic withdraws, stepped down the amounts in the liquid. Then just stopped once I had stepped it down enough that the withdraws wouldn't be as horrible.""Don't drink for 1-2 months. 
""I just stopped smoking, yeah there are physical aspects of the process but it's mostly mental. Gotta be strong!""For me it was having a child.  Currently 30 and had my daughter 6 months ago and haven't smoked since about 2 weeks before her birth.

  Being fully aware that you are responsible for someone's else's life, forever, makes you wanna live as long as possible. 

The smell of cigs bothers me now, although when my friends bring a vap I do use it. ""Stopped smoking.  That's all there is to it. (Really!)

Most smokers don't understand that but most ex-smokers do.""I quit cold turkey. At work that day I told everyone in a company meeting I was quitting, and might be grumpy for a few days.  I received a spontaneous round of applause. I think that actually helped a lot: having announced to everyone at work I was quitting, I had to stick with it. Everyone was watching! They even clapped for me! I haven't smoked in 10 years."Not a smoker myself but my Dad used to go through 2 packs a day. One day he decided to just stop. No patches or gum. Hasn't smoked since.I had tried multiple times to quit. I finally got so mad that I was relapsing. I knew I was not week so I had to prove it to myself. I just swore I would keep trying to quit and just get over my failures. I knew that whatever my chances were (in this case it was about 1in11) I just had to try that many times. For me it was getting sick for a couple weeks. Was to sick to smoke and after I was better I just didn't have the cravings anymore Buy a e-cig. Work your way down to 0 nic"I've been a non-smoker for a year and 30 days (NYE resolution) after smoking for 10 years. What worked for me was cold turkey. You're addicted to nicotine, and the sooner you stop using it the sooner it's effects wear off. No sense in dragging out the pain. 


Also, check out r/stopsmoking. It's a great community, and it helped me more than anything. I tried quitting countless times before, but only needed one try when I had r/stopsmoking behind me.


Another thing that helps is getting an app for your smartphone. ""My Last Cigarette"" for iPhone is what I used, but ""Cessation Nation"" for android is the gold standard. They track your money saved, your health benefits, and give you achievements as you progress. Whenever I had a craving I would look at my phone at r/stopsmoking or my app, and before I knew it, the craving passed.


Last thing is to remember that whenever you want a cigarette it's not you that wants it, it's the nicotine monster living inside you. Don't feed that little fucker. You were a non-smoker for decades (probably) before you smoked, and you'll be a non-smoker for decades after (hopefully). Good luck pal.""The first step is to be sure that you want to quit. When I realized that, I started reading Alan Carr's book. I highly recommend it. It won't convince you to quit, but if you want to, it will help a lot. Another important thing is realizing there is no significant physical addiction (nicotine addiction only lasts a week more or less), so that's why patches, pills and whatnot don't work. The real addiction is psychological. So you have to be positive about it. When you see someone smoking, don't think about how relaxed they might be feeling or whatever, think about how their breath and hands smell like shit, how they spend tons of money for something damaging their bodies, how pitiful and enslaved they are for having to go out every hour or so for a smoke, even if it's cold, rainy or whatever. You just have to stop and don't try to replace it with something else. The first month is the hardest, if you get passed it, you're fine. ""Pill called "" Champix ""

Doctor told me to keep smoking like normal and ""one day I would just quit"", of course I was very skeptical after smoking 16 years and failing on various products.

I was a pack a day smoker (20 - 25), when I started taking Champix. On day 6 I had a busy day at work, when I was eating dinner I was thinking back on my day and realized I only had 4 cigarettes all day. At that point it was mind over matter (getting out of the habit of coffee + cigarette, or beer + cigarette).

Champix pretty much blocks out the ""craving"" part (nicotine craving in brain), you have to want to quit and it will be easy.

5 years smoke free and I still get odd craving, especially when I am around other people who are smoking. I am positive I will crave it rest of my life.

Champix is in Canada and has helped not only myself but countless family and friends quit smoking. It really works.

Goodluck!

EDIT: Different Pill name per country:

Varenicline (trade name Chantix in the USA and Champix in Canada, Europe and other countries, marketed by Pfizer, usually in the form of varenicline tartrate), is a prescription medication used to treat nicotine addiction. Varenicline is a nicotinic receptor partial agonistÛÓit stimulates nicotine receptors more weakly than nicotine itself does. In this respect it is similar to cytisine and different from the nicotinic antagonist, bupropion, and nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) like nicotine patches and nicotine gum. As a partial agonist it both reduces cravings for and decreases the pleasurable effects of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Through these mechanisms it can assist some patients to quit smoking."Don't light up another cigarette. Worked for me."You need to want to quit.  Being around people who don't smoke helps a lot.  The first two weeks is the worst, then it ain't so bad.  Do it cold turkey."Getting pregnant "Yeah i think thay only willpower can do it. Its the same with any addiction, youll get to a point where youre so sick of it you have the will to quit. If you cant quit now, you will in the future. Thats how the suppliers of addictive substances keep you, they supply low concentrations so that it takes longer for you to get sick of it and quit."Dipped for a week to break the habit of picking up a cigarette. Dipping was already disgusting to me enough that it was easy to drop afterwards."I got tired of it. It's expensive, bad for your health, and alienates others. However, you won't be able to quit until you really want to and that desire is stronger than the addiction. 

You will probably put on some weight when you quit, but a gym membership should offset that, and the money saved from not smoking will more than cover a gym membership. 

When you finally decide to quit, avoid your smoker friends for a week. It also might be a good idea to hold off on drinking. 

I did it by counting each day as a win. The first week is the hardest. The urges still come, but they pass, and they lose intensity.

When I decided I was done I was going to use the nicotine gum to quit but after two days I was getting addicted to that and decided to switch to Dentyne Ice and suffer through for a few weeks. By week 3 I was mostly ok with the cravings, by month 2 the habit was gone as well.

""Cold turkey---  after 15 years of a pack and a half a day.  I was in the hospital for a weekend, and after that 55+ hours of not having the choice to smoke, I thought it would be the best time to quit for good.  The physical addiction had already mostly subsided, and I realized that it was mostly psychological.  With that mindset, I challenged myself to overcome it, and it got increasingly easier as days passed.  Changing your habits, i.e. while driving, after meals, while waiting on automated computer procedures/downloads was the most difficult thing.  I took to eating pretzel rods whenever I found myself reaching for something by instinct, and that helped.  It's been 8 years, now, and I'll never smoke again.  Good luck to you!""I had to quit because I had chronic tonsillitis, requiring a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. The operating surgeon, upon learning that I was a smoker told me straight-up that he would not operate on me unless I had sustained from smoking for 48 hours, and then could not smoke for weeks afterward. Knowing that my throat infections and need for surgery was at least partially created by my smoking, I decided to quit.

My winning formula was Chantix, and to battle the oral fixation and need to have something in my hands, I used cut-up straws and cinnamon sticks as physical substitutes. The cinnamon sticks inparticular were a real winner, they took away the empty feel of not having something between my lips or fingers, and quite honestly tasted nice. And Chantix, well... I know that has quite the reputation but let me be forthright here, I couldn't have done it without Chantix. What the Chantix did basically was made the cigarettes taste terrible, and I mean DISGUSTING. One day, with a pocketful of cinnamon sticks in tow I went to light a cigarette, was immediately repulsed and then I asked myself if I even wanted to finish the cigarette. I put it out, pulled out a cinnamon stick and that was that!

You need an external stimulus, and tools to help you with the incredible urges. I feel that in a healthcare environment you could easily get away with chewing cinnamon sticks if you cleared it with your supervisor, as it's not inherently dirty and would allow you to start a productive conversation about smoking with your co-workers and other patients. Many insurance providers don't pay for Chantix but may pay for Wellbutrin, though if you decide to go with medication you need to be vigilant and watch for any personality or mood changes. If people around you say that you've been acting differently or if you feel different in an unpleasing way, you need to stop taking the medication IMMEDIATELY. Your prescribing doctor or pharmacist can give you clearer information than I, and I recommend that you consult with them rather than trusting to contents of this thread. But I quit 4 years ago and my successful effort was after many failed efforts. Just don't give up hope and one day you'll find your winning combination of tools, external influences and gut-level determination!""99% of it was just mentally preparing myself that I would never have another cigarette again.  But for me the problem was the stress.  Sitting in traffic, long meetings, arguments with girlfriends, etc.  So on top of quitting cigarettes, I also had to learn how to manage stress better.  I still haven't gotten that part down 100%, but I've really had to relax myself more since quitting.  I don't let things get me worked up.""I decided I wanted to quit.  When I quit, I constantly reminded myself that I didn't need to not smoke for the rest of my life or the next year, month, week or even day.  I only needed to not smoke the next cigarette.  The urge to smoke any one cigarette lasts for about 5-10 minutes.  So you really just have to win a small battle each time you get the urge.  Initially, those battles fall one right after the other.  But with each day, week, month and year, those battles become fewer and further between.  I've lost that battle a few times.  But I've won 99.9% of them and have called myself a non-smoker for 6 years."Daughter's birth. "Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking.

Really rubs in the damage you're doing to your lungs.Cold Turkey. I went through some pretty intense withdrawals.. but I would do it all over again just to never smoke another cigarette. "I'm not sure I'm completely an ""ex-smoker"" but I've gone from smoking a pack a day in college to smoking once in a great while at a party, at a bar, concert, camping, on vacation, or something like that.  I'd say on average I smoke probably 2-3 cigarettes a month, but they usually come at a rate of 5 or 6 one weekend, then not again for a couple of months.  I don't smoke every time I drink or I'm around smokers, but sometimes the mood strikes, and I partake.  

From what I gather, I'm unusual in that the actual habitual part was the harder thing to break than the chemical addition.  I rarely feel the absolute physical need for a smoke, but it would be nice to go stand outside for 10 minutes, and smoking was the thing that I'd do to pass the time when I did that.  The first time I quit though, it was about a week of thinking in my head:

Me: ""I want a cigarette.""

Me: ""NO! You're quitting cigarettes! You CAN'T have a cigarette!""

Me: ""Shit, that's right.  It's a good thing I didn't have a cigarette.  I'll reward myself for not smoking by having a cigarette."" 

Me: ""NO!...""

Once I got past that, the best thing I did was simply NOT buying them.  At first, it was weird to go to a gas station without buying a pack, but I got used to it, and I found that it was much easier to talk myself out of having a cigarette if there were none around to smoke, so I was using my laziness to prevent my smoking.  If I had a pack around, I'd finish them, and then no more.  Really, I was only able to really quit for extended periods of time once I was no longer around smokers on a regular basis. 

So anyway, I realize I'm probably not a good case to emulate, but it works for me.  I'm sure I still do some level of damage with this level of smoking, but it must be less than smoking a pack a day, and it's a level I'm happy with. ""Stick with the E-Cig, that's what I did. Also, however much a pack of cigs cost where you are, put that amount of money away as often as you would buy cigs. For example, I used to smoke a pack a day and I live in NY..when I started to use the E-Cig, I would put $10 in a jar every day (because I used to buy a pack a day and that's how much they cost here) and at the end of the month I had an extra $300 in the jar. Felt real good to see.""The only thing that works is not lighting up a cigarette, you just have to have the will power.  Use this thought to help you try to quit: The urge to smoke will pass, whether you smoke or not."Take up dipping"I quit smoking after NYE. This is the fourth time I am trying and this time I still haven't smoked and also didn't really want to. This because I am using an electronic sigarette (without nicotine). I don't care for smoking when I am alone, but with friends who all smoke I have a really hard time, I don't really know why. But when I feel the need I just take a few hits from the electronic one and I am good. So maybe this some good advice for anyone who wants to quit.""I smoked 1 pack a day for 5 years. In order to quit, I moved across the country. All of my surroundings changed instantly - the places I associated with smoking were all gone). This sounds extreme, but I quit instantly.

Anyway, the way I usually quit is pick a weekend, preferably a 3 day weekend.   And then drink until you pass out 3 days in a row with no smokes.    It takes 72 hrs for the need to clear your system.   All you have to do is find a way to occupy that time with no nicotine.   Though it does suck to come back to work after.

But I feel for you.   When I worked an insurance gig, the only time we got breaks was to go light up ever 2 hrs or so.

You always have to be thinking about them, planning them out (will I have enough at this point of the day?  Will I be able to smoke at this or that function?  Whats my cig budget at?  What do I have to cut to make sure I can buy cigs next week?).  You'll experience anxiety at even the thought of being without them, and you'll change your life and routine to accommodate smoking.  And when that happens, make no mistake, your habit is controlling you, and you've become a slave to it.

And after ~17 years of pack-a-day, I couldn't do any physical activity.  I wanted to get back to playing tennis and running, but no friggin way that was going to happen.  Quitting at 33 (37 now) was the best life change I've ever made, and I don't say that lightly.""I smoked cigarettes for ~1 year, I was at about 10 cigs a day in college, when one night we went out drinking and i must have ripped a whole pack in a few hours. I woke up the next morning feeling like shit, went outside for a puff, ripped it once and puked my brains out.

I have never even thought about a cigarette since, I have been scarred for life since then.""I work in a critical care unit, I quit smoking shortly after. Suffocating to death looks fucking miserable, it's funny how after a while you think the cancer patients are the lucky ones after watching that shit.""Cold turkey.  New years of 1995, never had even a puff since.  ""1: this was years ago when i was in High School, getting close to 20 years ago now.

2: i switched from smoking cigs to smoking pot...no longer had any desire to smoke cigs and didn't want to chain smoke all my weed because it was (relatively) expensive.

3: i'm an adult now and i don't smoke anything, nor do i have any desire to.

4: i am in no way advocating that anyone start smoking pot as a way to quit smoking cigs, i am relating my own journey to quitting smoking, do NOT try this at home.""Straight out of college, I was working construction and I got up to 2 packs a day. I realized I had to do something. Cutting down was easy, but it took me several years to fully quit.

- I took up cycling. This helped me cut down by a good bit.

- I stopped smoking in the car. Driving was my trigger, and quitting smoking in the car was the biggest first step.

- I got into competitive cycling. I built the strength and the power to get results, but I still cheated and had a couple cigs a week.

- I burned out on cycling and started smoking a bit more.

- I took up running, and smoking became painful. Running is harder than cycling, and I could feel that one single ""I was drunk"" cheater cig for days afterward. 

- I decided that I didn't want to look like trailer trash lighting up and smelling like an ashtray when I was 30.

- I haven't had a cigarette since last May, about 5 months before my 30th birthday.""Exercise. I found I couldn't *really* work out and smoke cigarettes. When I started to look and feel so much better from the exercise, finding the will to stay quit wasn't too bad. Quitting and taking up physical activity have led to one of the biggest transformations of my life, I highly recommend it."Switch to weed.  I'm not joking.  And use a vaporizer.The woman I was seeing at the time told me it made my cum taste bad.  I quit that day. "If you can try to find a place where they give Ibogaine.  It's an african root that's supposed to reset the switches in your brain to what they were before the addiction.  It's used to help treat heroin, opiate, alcohol, and some other addictions but it can be pretty expensive to get ahold of it and is illegal depending on where you live.  ""This is how I quit.

One day I felt incredibly cold (which rarely happens to me, I like cold surroundings) and I tried to smoked a cigaret. That cigaret was horrible and my throat hurt like hell.


When I got home I found out that I had a fever, and I slept for 3 days straight, did not really eat much, just drank water when I woke up and then fell asleep again.


So I woke up on the forth day and wasn't sick anymore and I hadn't smoked for 3 days, so my first thought was: Fuck it, I don't smoke anymore... it has lasted for 10 months so that is really nice.""Vaping (Green Smoke) did it for me - maybe try a different brand, strength, flavor, form factor.""Used e-cigs, got a different job."/r/electronic_cigarette"I just decided to try and quit.  The most important part of this is to remove your access to cigs.  Just stop buying them, you can't smoke them if you don't have them around can you?   Don't bum off others either.   I did this for about a week and never smoked again (that was 2 years ago).   Tried a cig a few months ago just for shits and giggles, tasted so terrible I wanted no more part of it.""Cold turkey. On the third attempt it has finally stuck. It's like what everyone else says, you just have to truly want it.

Every smoke you deny yourself is one step towards kicking the habit. Just work one by one and look forward to the sweet relief of sleep.

Try to remember how you beat each craving and create a ""toolkit"" to take each one on with confidence.""About 12-13 years ago I decided to stop smoking. The first thing I did was throw away all the ash trays in the house and only have one outside on the patio.  I also took the one out of the car.  In the house and in the Car were now Non-Smoking 100% of the time.  That cut the habit by about half.  The hard part was smoking at work, but I decided that I would tag along with the break time walkers instead of the break time smokers. 
By then I was down to half a pack a day tops.  After a few months of this My wife and I (She was doing the same routine) decided to have a Cold Turkey Weekend.  We stayed home, no smoking and by Monday we were fine. The physical need is supposed to leave your body in 72 hours or so... We found that after weening down to half a pack a day, that this was true and we haven't smoked since. ""After 25 years of smoking, only ecigs helped me.

I have an eGo set up with 24mg juice. The first week was a little rough as I found the perfect combination of juice, atty and wattage, but it's been over 3 years now and I'm feeling great."I got my boyfriend to try e cig...then he slowly smoked less and less to the point where he started to forget to smoke on breaks"Smoked heavily for 19 years. I work hospitality so smoking is part and parcel of it and the only break I would sometimes get in 12 hour day, was a quick cig give break. I decided 18 months ago that I really really really wanted to quit, so I tried the gum and lozenges. They tasted like shit, like actually sucking on an old piece of gum that had been in an ashtray. They can also upset your stomach and give you head rushes from nicotine overdose. 

I couldn't handle that shit after like 2 days so needed something different. I downloaded Allan Carr's easy way to stop smoking to my iPhone kindle app, read it before bed one night, woke up not even craving one and haven't had one since. I have had no withdrawals/cravings whatsoever in the interim. Best decision and $8 I ever spent in my life!""So this wasn't me, but was a former student of one of my high school teachers. The teacher and this student were close somehow, and one day the teacher found out that the student smoked. So the teacher bought a bunch of cigarettes, and brought them to the student. Teacher then told the student that either thy were going to smoke all of these cigs consecutively, or their parents would be told about the smoking. Student trued to smoke all of them, got violently ill, and allegedly did not smoke again.""Does not sound logical, but dip tobacco. I had a friend who was a leutenant and dipped all the time. I tried it out one summer and smoking was that much easier to quit. I still got my nicotine fix, but didn't smoke. After a while, I started getting used to smelling good, not having to change clothes or being self conscious around my girlfriend's parents. (If they knew I smoked, they would be very disappointed.) I also had better sex, longer runs, more energy, I could smell things. After a while, I switched from american dip to swedish snus. They have lower nicotine content, neater pouches, and even taste good. I went from using two to using just one. After almost a year of this transformation, I start and stop whenever I please. 

Nicotine patches don't work for me because they give me a steady nicotine release, while my tobacco habits give me a up and down roller coaster of nicotine highs and lows. 

I had a pass-through eGoT with Halo juices at 23%, and somehow that started to burn my throat and was impossible to inhale. 

You might be turned off to the idea of dipping, and that's okay. I hope you find a better way"I tried about 14 times over two years. I figured if I stop buying them I would not smoke... I got so desperate I would start taking them out of ash treys and the floor. Some of the times I stopped for 3 months and sometimes it was just for 28 hrs. Sometimes it is just about timing and one of these times you quit it will stay. One of the things I did on my final time was taking two weeks off working and going camping/hiking. It sort of kept my mind occupied. "Im 21, been smoking since freshman year of highschool. Up until 6 months ago. Ive tried patches, and gum but it didnt work for me. 
I looove smoking but at the same time i would quit if i had the strength to. But instead i substituted with an ecig. Not one of those cheap ecigs but a legit one. I got one from good guy vapes and i just puff on that all day. Im still taking in the nicotine (if not more) but i have stopped actually smoking. A few weeks into the ecig, i had no need for cigarettes. I took a pull of a boge to test the difference and I was actually repulsed by the smell and taste after so long haha. My sense came back to me. I still take nicotine but now i can run as fast as i used to when i was at army basic training
""Getting a girlfriend. She didn't want me to smoke so I quit.


I smoked for 7 years and have been 2å? years without.. I still crave for a smoke every now and then. Also, one time I managed to quit for 6 months because I got sick. While sick I didn't feel like smoking at all and after getting healthier I thought I could go on for longer.""I used an eCig quite successfully. Started out at 18mg of nicotine and just took a step down about every 3rd juice purchase (roughly, every 2 months)

Steps were 18 - 12 - 6 -3 - 0

Worked like a charm. It's been a few months since I hit 0 and I feel great. 
I don't even take the eCig everywhere anymore. I just leave it home for when I'm in the mood.""I was transitioning to e-cigs because I lied to everyone at work and said I quit smoking, when I was whacked in the face by a piece of exercise equipment and broke some teeth. Needless to say, by the time I was able to smoke again, I no longer needed to do so.

WARNING: Do not try this, it may not work for everyone and tooth-loss may vary.""I used the nicotine gum, but I chewed that gum for a long time.  ""/r/stopsmoking did it for me!
"My daughter was born. I tried the Cooper/Clayton classes. I tried Chantix and NicoDerm but nothing worked like them putting my little girl in my arms. Quit cold turkey. The last cigarette I ever smoked was the one I had on the way to the hospital for her birth."I used the niccorette lozenges you take them every two hours or so and can have them whenever/wherever you want. You start at the 4mg dosage and then after a month or two you go to the 2 mg and you basically ween yourself off of cigarettes.  For the next couple months after you stop taking them regularly I would keep some of them around too just incase you get a real strong craving or get really stressed out or are out drinking. That way you can just pop one in and not get right back into it. 

I've tried to quit ten times before but this is the first time it worked. It's been about a year since my last cigarette and I don't miss it at all. Don't even really get cravings ever.  ""Cold turkey.  The pain/worse periods runs in 3s.  The 3rd hour, the 3rd day, 3rd week, 3rd month.. Those are when you want to get weak.  So you just remember once you are past that 3, you are set again for awhile.""Cold Turkey is how I stopped. I wasn't even that addicted to them really, only smoking around friends in school and whatnot. After school stopped I had a whole pack and it took me half a year to finish it off, after that I just stopped buying them. Sucked for a couple days but then I moved on.""""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" book. No bullshit.  I didn't even want to quit, I loved smoking.  Haven't touched a cigarette in 4 years after reading that book.""Don't tell yourself its going to suck. Tell yourself its great because you get to stop a shitty habit and save money. Try to think about smoking as little as possible. Find things to do in those times you'd normally be smoking. And most importantly, don't get drunk for at least the first month.""I masturbate a LOT more now. 9, 10 sometimes 12 times a day.

No but for real it's the ridiculous prices of them now. It's not worth it."Just quit man. You can do it. "My grandmother died of lung cancer. She smoked right up to the end. The sound of her hacking her lungs out was excruciating. 

She left me a little bit of money and I spent it on a prescription for the patch (this was back in 1992 and it was brand new). I put the patch on September 16, 1992 and I haven't had a cigarette since.

The patch provided the extra kick I needed to quit for two reasons. First, it itches a bit, which reminds you that it is there and for me reminded me not to smoke. Second, the instructions are pretty clear that smoking while using the patch is a very bad idea.

The real key is motivation and finding the right thing to help you through the transition. 

Good luck!""My grandparents used to smoke, one day my grandmom told the rest of the family she had gotten lung cancer because of it. She only lived a couple more months after that. It was painful for everyone, she knew she had provoked it herself. The day after she died my grandfather stopped smoking, it was late for him too anyway. He didn't smoke for more than 15 years, yet the effects of the cigarette were there and he got some obstruction in his lungs which led him to slowly losing his strength and dying. The point is, do not wait until you lose someone to realize it is too late to stop.""I started running.

I quickly found out I couldn't run for more than a kilometer at a time without coughing my lungs out and BAM. That's when I realized smoking wasn't worth it and it became my biggest motivator to quitting. 

Compared to other smokers out there I didn't even smoke *that* much - only ~10 cigarettes a day. 

Now, 60 days after I quit, I am able to run around 8km without the need to cough my lungs out or getting the feeling they are burning. 
Swoosh"Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. Read it once in late 2001 and have never smoked since."I have been smoke free for almost 4 years now. I tried Chantix, Nicotine Patches, and wellbutrin. The way that I quit was cold-turkey. I decided that I was done hacking up a lung every morning. The way I got through it was figuring out all of my triggers. I wanted a cigarette every time I got into a car. Every time I finished eating. Everytime I went to the bar. When I figured out my habits, I would then just sit there for a minute and tell myself that I don't want a cigarette. It's just because I got into the car that I want a cigarette. I would then do deep breathing until the crave passed. I have found that the deep breathing is what makes smoking a relaxing habit. 
     It eventually gets easier, but there are many times that I still want a cigarette. I just don't do it anymore. Good Luck.""You have to keep trying to go cold turkey. There are tons of plans out there to help make this work but it's the fastest (and possibly most difficult) way to break your body of its terrible dependency and it will work if you want it to. 

If you're interested in going the vape route as a cessation tactic you'll need a decent setup that delivers a reasonable amount of nicotine into your system to take the edge off, and then taper down the nicotine content of your liquid. See /r/electronic_cigarette for more information if you're interested, but I'm not touting vaping as the best solution. If anything it's just a replacement vice (albeit a seemingly 'healthier' one).""I used sunflower seeds.

The constant hand to mouth motion combined with the tasty treat of sunflower seeds kept me from lighting up. I'd rather have another handful of sunflower seeds to chew through than to light up.

This may not work for OP because he/she is at work but it worked for me at home.

""I held my newly born daughter in my arms in the hospital, and couldn't stand the thought of putting her down so I could go outside and suck cancer into my lungs.

The discomfort was far outweighed by the pure, unadulterated love and joy I felt in holding her.

Four kids, eight years later and I don't miss them.  I had a cigarette when I was drunk a few weeks back.  My head swirled and I swooned like a 14 year old in Justin Bieber's bedroom.  Next morning, I felt just about as proud of myself too..."Chantix and the desire to really quit. "I quit for myself and because I wanted to and for no other reason.  Trying to quit because I got a new job, new girlfriend, whatever...never worked for me.  As soon as there was an issue (such is life) with the reason that I quit, I was back to smoking.


I also discovered that the actual physical cravings were gone after about the first two weeks and then it became a psychological battle to not only quit initially but to keep making that decision to quit day in and day out.  It got A LOT easier after that first couple weeks.


I also had triggers around me everyday like just getting in the damn car!  It was a battle just to say no and remind myself that this was for me.  It oddly felt selfish? to be doing something JUST for myself but ultimately was one of the best decisions I ever made.""I started smoking when I was 12, smoked as much as a pack and a half a day in my mid 20s, stopped and started a few times, last time I started was because I gave in to my addiction and justified it with ecigs, I haven't smoked in 1 year and am still dealing with my addiction day by day""The biggest thing that worked for me which was unfortunate was leaving all my friends that smoked or hanging out with them much more sparingly. I also had a drinking problem and not hanging out with my other alcoholic friends really did it. I kept telling myself I would hang out with them and just not participate, but unfortunately my willpower always fell short so I had to resort to a more dramatic response which was just not seeing them.""I used Nicorette and did really well on it but it isn't for everyone. I would suggest you ditch the e-cig next time you try, because the actions required to use it are identical to those needed to smoke a cigarette and that is part of the habit itself. Good Luck!""I switched to e-cigs a year ago, haven't looked back.
""A prescription for Wellbutrin. Makes you feel insanely queasy if you smoke while you're on it, which is way worse than the craving for a cigarette. Eventually, you get so fearful of the queasiness, that you can't stand to even think about smoking. I was on a pretty high dosage for about 4 months and tapered off for another 6, and haven't smoked since."Health reasons. The Doctor told me I have Stage 1 hypertension. I have seen enough stroke victims in my life to know that I would rather die than suffer through that. I haven't had a cigarette in almost two years and don't plan on ever going back. I like being smoke free."I chewed nicotine gum for one year exactly. On my one year anniversary of being ""smoke-free,"" I quit the gum. I've now been smoke free for almost 5 years, nicotine free for almost 4. I used to smoke a pack a day for about 15+ years""I was only able to quit after having my wisdom teeth pulled. Since my mouth was a huge open sore that last thing I wanted to do was suck a bunch of hot caustic smoke into it. Plus I was pretty worried about getting a dry socket. 

So, yeah, have some teeth pulled.""Most people are saying cold turkey, but as an anecdote, that didn't work for my dad. He actually went to one of those group hypnosis things. He said he went in and took a nap, thought he wasted his money but had no craving for cigarettes after that. Personally I'm skeptical of hypnosis but when it's your health who cares how you managed to finally quit. ""I got bronchitis and strep throat at the same time.  Smoking wasn't very far up on the list of things I wanted to do.  Haven't had one since.

For the record: I tried chantix twice, once I quit for 6 months and once for 8, but always wanted to smoke, which is what took me back to it.  Chantix works pretty well.  If you don't truly actually *want* to quit, it's hard to stay off it when you are successful.  Quitting for other ""concerned"" people, no matter how right, concerned or close to you they are, isn't enough.  Quitting for health reasons, no matter how critical they are, if you don't really actually *want* to quit is pointless and very unlikely to be permanent.  I'm not talking about saying ""yeah, I'm tired of spending money, it's not good for me, my girlfriend/mom/wife/friends don't like it,"" I'm talking about those reasons causing a drive that changes YOUR mentality to want to have more money, be healthier, or making you not like it.  There's a difference, and it's the difference that separates an attempt to quit from quitting."I chewed the gum and stayed out of bars or around others who smoked.Pneumonia"My third anniversary will be on President's Day in February.  I quit because I was having a LDR with a woman, and she was coming to visit me the following month.  I had not seen her since college.  She said that she would not kiss me if I was a smoker.  I told my kids that I quit for them since they were on my ass about it for years.  They still believe it.

I woke up that day had one cigarette and never had another.  I had been planning it for awhile.  I was a pack to two packs a day smoker for 15 years.  It was the first thing that I did in the morning and the last thing that I did at night.  The first 10 days or so were bad, but I was determined.  I still miss it and crave those sweet cigarettes often.""I did Chantix for a month. Made made me quite pissy and sick as hell, but I had no cravings for cigarettes. After the initial month I had small cravings here and there, but it was nothing I couldn't handle.""So, I decided about 8 months ago to take the leap into not smoking.  I bought one of those e-cigarettes and tried that for a little while.  I kept just picking up the cigarettes, rather than the e-cig.  About a month ago, I decided I was just going to do it.  I started gradually replacing my cigarette habit with the e-cig.  For instance, if you smoke once an hour, every other hour have a cigarette, and gradually replace the cigarette all together.  The truth is your body doesn't notice the difference between the e-cig and the regular cig.  Your thoughts do.  If you keep telling yourself that it's the cigarette you want, that is what you are going to have.  If you tell yourself it is the e-cig you want, that is what you are going to have.  Regardless of the method you use, it really is just sticking to it and telling yourself this is what you want, while meaning it.  I am now down to 2 cigarettes a week.  Soon, I should be done with them all together. ""I got fed up with them: the awful way my hands and clothes smelled, coughing, worrying about the cough, having bad sense of smell and taste and so on. 

Which is to say that I tried to mentally put myself in a spot where I acknowledged and understood all the shitty things smoking did to my life. 

Nowadays, looking back, I can't believe how stupid I was for smoking for 10 years.""The process of buying, pulling it from the pack, and lighting a cigarette is a conscious one. 

Decide to stop doing one of those steps and you will stop smoking.

You might want to start up again, but don't. Be stronger than a tube of dried plants.

It will take a long time, but each time you feel weak remember that you do not want to smoke, don't make deals with yourself, don't ""just this once"".

If (when) you do break down and buy a pack and smoke a cig after that cig destroy the pack and throw it away, then start quitting again.

Don't give up, be stronger than the cigarettes.

Don't give up, wake up and quit everyday."I smoked for a little over 6 years and finally stopped last month when my second daughter was born. "I used the gum but I chewed it before I ha cravings. I had a piece whenever I usually had a cigarette, and then a few more to smooth out the edges. I hated the gum but it really made the cravings subside. Good luck. ""I smoked for 13 years and my parents were smokers too. I tried quitting with many different methods, patch, gum, cold turkey, but the only thing that actually worked for me was Chantix. After about a week or so of taking it I would go outside and smoke and actually not feel anything from it. No high, no reprieve from the urge (though the urge was a lot less already) and I ended up quitting about a week and a half in instead of the 2 weeks they say you should continue. 

I did have a little depression but I attributed that mostly to the MAJOR life change I was making. ""What am I going to do with all this extra time?"" ""How will I get a break at work?"" All these things running through my head, change is scary. But now it's been 6 years as of last November and I look back on it and say ""WTF WAS I THINKING?!"" I honestly believe that Chantix saved my life, it wasn't possible for me to quit any other way - I just couldn't do it. Anyway I hope OP and whomever else is trying to quit has best of luck with whatever method they choose."Getting pregnant"I went cold turkey too, but I did it with a twist. I started the quit with a vacation. I was out of my normal routine for a week, and that really helped because my triggers were routine based (walk to the train, smoke; walk to my building, smoke; let the dog out at night, smoke; etc.). Also, I was mostly distracted by the sites that I didn't crave it as much and I was forced to be pleasant because I didn't want to ruin the vacation. ""I have been smoke/nicotine/tobacco free since November 2010 and there's no chance of me going back. I tried most of the quitting products like gums and patches. I ended up using lozenges for 3 weeks but realized its really nicotine addiction thats causing the agony and not tobacco. So I asked myself am I really making progress? I quit nicotine cold turkey shortly after, and it sucked for a few weeks. Now when I have an impossible feeling task at hand I just remember quitting cigarettes and know I can do anything. Honestly, it's going to be difficult and nothing can really help you. But you will have to go through it one day or smoke the rest of your life. Why not make it today? ""People build 'stopping smoking' up to be such a huge thing.

You literally just stop. No more cigarettes. done. 

I quit cold turkey just over 2 years ago now, no huge secrets.. Just quit smoking. Have the determination and prove to yourself that you CAN do it. Imagine what else that new found determination can accomplish."Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking book is what finally led me to quit after smoking a pack a day for 15 years. "I bought a book and every time I thought about smoking I would read until I forgot about that cigarette.  I read 2 books before I considered myself weened.  

Patience with yourself is a plus.""Vamo with Protank II, and e-juice containing nicotine.  

Also, my father, and brother-in-law were both smokers:  both died suddenly from massive heart attacks.  Father was 47, BIL was 46.  
My sister, who was married to this BIL, then died at 42-43 from cancer caused from smoking (which was not sudden, sadly).  I just don't want to go out like that, and die on my kids.""This won't apply to everyone, but I just wanted it enough. I loved the act of smoking itself, but it made my hangovers worse, it made me a worse athlete, and I was embarrassed to be seen smoking. The biggest thing for me was that as an on and off smoker, I could actually feel a marked difference in my cardiovascular system between weeks I was smoking and weeks I wasn't. At some point, my foreknowledge of how much worse I would feel if I smoked overcame my cravings.

TBH though, I still sneak a cigarette every now and then. And I always feel the worse for it.""I smoked for 5 years. I was always a pretty skinny guy. At one point I was 140 lbs at 5'11"". I decided I was going to put on some weight so I began hitting the gym and trying to eat a lot more. I found it hard to meet the caloric surplus that I desired when I smoked. I also heard and read about how bad smoking is for weight gain. This was the biggest factor in me quitting. I quit 14 months ago and have gained 30 pounds of muscle. I can't say it was entirely from quitting smoking, but I think the results are much better because of that choice.""Dating somebody that didn't smoke was a huge factor.  I was able to quit cold turkey.  She never nagged me, I just didn't want to be all stinky around her.  And she didn't have any of the ""rituals"" associated with smoking, so we just did other stuff.  It was pretty easy after the second week.

I think the biggest thing was committing to not buy a pack again.  If I didn't buy them, I wouldn't be tempted.  I used to tell myself I could buy a pack and just smoke one here and there, but before I would know it I'd be sucking them down like candy again.

Staying out of bars and smokey places was necessary for a while.

And then the state (PA) made it illegal to smoke in all public places except bars that only sold a marginal amount of food and casinos.  This was really helpful, as it totally changed the culture of smoking overnight and helped minimize exposure and temptation, it helped solidify it for me.

Good luck to anybody on this journey.  It's well worth it.  And hell, one day (several years from now), you can probably handle having a cigar with the guys or even a rare cigarette outside the pub without going full nicotine zombie again.

Never go full nicotine zombie...""This probably doesn't help, but I met a girl.

She was the girl of my dreams, completely out of my league, but she wanted to be with me. She didn't mind that I smoked, but I knew she didn't want me to. And I realized that if I was serious about having a life with her, I needed to quit.

Decided that day I was quitting, finished off my pack, and haven't smoked a single cigarette since. I wasn't a lifetime smoker, only smoked for about 7 or 8 years, but the thought that I could get married, have kids, enjoying a full life with this girl was a reality to me, and smoking just cut a large slice of time out of my happiness. 

TL;DR met a girl, quit cold turkey to be happy. ""Smoked for 21 years about a pack a day.  Tried gum, patches, prescription meds (was able to quit twice using them, both for 2 - 3 years, but started again).  

Last month I used ecigs to kick it.  I can't recommend it enough.  No, I am not off nicotine, but the ecigarette is so much better a delivery system than cigarettes I couldn't smoke a cigarette now if I wanted to.  Completely unsatisfying.

Not to mention, a pack of cigs cost me $6.60, one per day, the equivalent amount of ejuice per day costs me around 20 cents.  

""Go cold turkey, but bring it together with positive psychology type activities. Instead of being negative about the bad effects, think about the good effects. If you quit you can spend more time with the people you love, have more money to do the things you want that kind of thing. Meditation and yoga are a great way to have a positive focus on your mind and your breath. 

And side note, e-cigarettes are not good for you at all, not as bad for secondhand but definitely not good for you (basically inhaling antifreeze)

Good luck you can do it (anyone reading this who wants to quit, rewards are endless, do it for yourself)""Well to tell you the truth, I finally found a good reason. I met a woman who I wanted more than cigarettes. Went cold turkey and it was no biggie. To be honest, quitting breakfast sandwiches was much harder.""I quit for spite. My Dr. told me there was no way I could quit without some kind of medicine or therapy. So I just quit. I left her office and finished the last three cigarettes in my current pack and didn't smoke again. I miss it, though. Nearly every day I think about smoking. I think I miss the little ""me time"" I'd have whenever I went outside for a smoke. It's also hard at work. You never really connect with someone better than when you're sharing a smoke break."I quit cold turkey.  Most people I've known that have quit using other methods always fell back into the habit.  It also helped that I got sick a couple days after I quit.  I had a cold or sinus infection or something and couldn't smoke for a few days anyway."I went to the hospital and got some of those nicotine inhalers for nicotine replacement therapy. I also purchased an electronic cigarette for 55$ (what i would spend in 2 weeks smoking). and nicorete gum.. oh and the patch but i stopped using them, allergic to the glue.

The electronic cigarette helped me the most honestly, as I could get flavored vapor with or with out nicotine. What it was really good for was getting the inhaling feeling. The habit is harder to break than the addiction, and having something actually hit my lungs what a godsend.""for me it was moving in with my girlfriend, she had a 3-year-old child at the time and i didn't want to expose the child to the smells and health risks. that was 24 years ago and i haven't smoked since. was a 20-30 cigarette a day person before that.

edit: of course, the ""child"" is now 28 and smokes now... :-/""An app created by the Norwegian ministry of health called, ""Slutta"". Basically a timer which tells you how long it has been since your last cigarette. It also calculates how much you have saved, how many grams of tar and nicotine you have avoided etc. Surprisingly effective.""For me, it was choosing an activity that was counter-active to smoking.  I chose stair-climbing.  Not only did it give me something to do that was very difficult if I was still smoking, but it also gave me a great outlet for stress and the like that I had once looked to smoking to help me cope with.  I picked an event and set a goal.  Now granted, I had reached the point where I really wanted to quite and was down to smoking about once a day, but it was stair-climbing that pushed me over the edge.  3.5 years later and I'm training for a climb right now.  ""In hopes that this gets through to someone, I have a pretty all or nothing personality.  So while quitting I also started dieting and working out (never having worked out before) at the same time.  It felt great that I was doing all these things at once to better my health and the soreness and craving the exercise made for a good distraction.  Alone with that I dropped sugar, caffiene, and drank tons of water at the same time.  It seems like torture but, I really turned my life around and I have kept a very healthy lifestyle while not smoking for over 5 years now.
""Sub-Lingual vitamin B Complex. 

This is, by far, the cheapest easiest solution next to cold turkey. At around 4 bucks a bottle, you take 1 100ml drop orally and hold it under your tongue for 30 seconds and then swallow.  Rinse and repeat every 8 hours or so. From what I understand, it contains Niacin and that is very close chemically to Nicotine. 

I  was a pack and a half a day smoker for 10 years and decided to quit back in May of 2013 and that along with prayer, getting rid ALL lighters, ash trays cellophane wrappers, cleaning house and fumigating throughly, washing all clothing, sheets, etc.. and having my car detailed allowed me to quit after the first week.

Don't get me wrong, I was a complete and utter headcase for about the first week, however, I don't regret it for one second.

Its a shame the medical community doesn't offer this and instead wants to be all greedy and give out anti-depressants like WellButrin and dangerous crap like Chantix which render all kinds of crazy sexual nightmares, instead of opting to promote a totally natural solution that actually works.

""Also, just to note, this is a process that requires a commitment to actually wanting to quit. 

 ""I smoked a pack an a half for a little over 20 years. In that period I did quit for a year, but had ""one"" celebratory smoke after the bar exam and was off for another 15 year run. Now I haven't had a smoke for 15 years.

I used a lot of AA techniques. I tried not to focus on not smoking for ever but only focused on not smoking now. I tried to avoid smoking situations, so I didn't step outside for my breaks, but went somewhere different. 

Although ecigarettes didn't exist when I quit 15 years ago, I'm not sure using them would help as they maintain the smoking behavior. I used the patch, though. 

Keep plugging away and don't beat yourself up (too much) if you slip. Also, I hate to break it to you, but I still crave cigarettes occasionally. Good Luck.""Smoked for 18 years since i was 13 years old.  One day after work decided to stop smoking and to help i bought one of those fancy e-cigs but like the higher end ones.  Used that for 2 weeks just to take a puff when i needed and out of habit.  One morning it fell out of my pocket and broke and decided not to spend the money to fix it and thats that!  I still miss smoking, more of the social aspect.""Sincere desire and quitting cold turkey.  Almost 4 years no cigs.

Details: I used to smoke.  Collapsed a lung hiking in colorado, had no idea and was walking around for a month with only 1 functioning lung. I just thought I had a sever case of the flu.  They reinflated it (story for a different time) but now that I know what it's like to walk around with 1 lung, fuck that.  Thats where my desire to quit came from.  It is really hard at first.  Everytime you see one you want one.. but that fades over time.  I liked to smoke a lot when I drank or played music.  It was a social thing since all of my friends smoked.  What helped was eliminating each piece individually.  For the first couple weeks when i got home i didn't hang out with my friends at all.. i could have but it was intentional, it was to quit smoking.  What I did almost every night was drink and play quitar by myself.. sounds sad but what I was doing was getting used to being drunk and playing music without cigs so the desire wasn't there as much when I was with friends.  First day or two it was hard, but quickly became easier.  Then when I started hanging out with friends I would just do small groups at first, I would avoid big parties.  This made it easier for me to not want to smoke in a social setting.  I used to bum cigarettes from my friends a lot, so when I was out with them I told them no matter how hard I beg do not give me cigarettes, I didn't buy any and quit.. I didn't say quitting.. i said quit (again desire has to be there).

Thats what worked for me.  Even almost 4 years later I still get a random desire while I'm out.. but each and every time it gets easier.  Sometimes just sitting next to a person who is smoking helps a tad, but if its a big group of people its too much anymore and can't stand it.

I hope this information is useful and good luck!""Going to the gym made me wanted to quit, and to manage the withdrawals (mostly when having a beer) [I ate roasted pumpkin seeds](http://cdn.sheknows.com/articles/crave/roasted_pumpkin_seed.jpg) ,why unpeeled? because peeling them is part of the distraction, every reunion, ball game or event, I carried my seeds, until one day I o longer needed them, a couple of friend tried it, but it didn't work for them, because they lack the main ingredient, which is actually wanting to quit."I'm in the process of cutting down/ trying to quit at the moment. Managed to go from 15 to 20 a day to just 2 or 3 within the first days if getting my ecig. Did a lot of research (YouTube vids) and decided to get the innokin vtr. Wasn't cheap but damn. This things a beast. Bought a bunch of tanks and liquids. Some with nicotine. Some without. And have a tank of each going. Mainly use the nicotine liquid in the mornings and at work as that's when I smoked the most anyway. And then use the non nicotine in the evenings when I'm just vaping away every 5 mins. It's awesome. Can't recommend it enough. Had a few days in the last week or so when not had a cig at all. U just don't miss it as much with such a powerful ecig. I mean this thing gives off more vapor than I get smoke from a cig!! And if u can find good liquids some of the flavours are immense. Wudnt defiantly recommend. I tend to have 1 cig in the morning now. Then use the ecig all day. Which I consider a massive improvement. not smoking cigarettes anymoreFor me. I was just too broke to afford it. I moved out on my own and I smoked for the first couple months. Than it was either be short on rent or buy a pack every couple days. "I psychologically ramped up my hatred for the addiction: the health effects, the smell, the corporate stranglehold on my life. The true hatred started when my doctor told me that when I turned 31, I would be at my peak bone density, and smoking would weaken that density.  Gross! I hated it so much that when I went cold turkey, I never looked back. It has been 9 years.""Honestly, I smoked an eCig for the habit and I smoked pot when the cravings got really bad. 
"Smoke some shitty stale cigs .  Hopefully with the motivation you can quit... Also I weened off by adding a  bit of tobacco to each joint then none..My dad stopped cold turkey when we were little. He used to put the money he would've been spending on cigs into a tin and spend it on fun stuff for us kids. That was a good summer. "I smoked for 9 years. The first step that ultimately lead me to quit was actually wanting to quit.


I read Alan Carr's the Easyway, since it seemed like everyone on reddit was recommending it. This took me two tries to finish, but once I did, it helped a lot. Gave me a perspective of what I was doing to myself by smoking.


Last step was Wellbutrin. Started taking this for a few months for other reasons, then decided that I'd quit ""cold turkey"" the day after the Super Bowl. I think the Wellbutrin definitely helped with the cravings, but quitting still requires willpower. Admittedly, it was easier to stop than I thought it would be.


Feb. 4 will be my one year mark without a cigarette.""Be honest with yourself about why you want to quit and find a cessation technique that works for you. The patch did wonders for me. Really took the edge off, but ultimately you will not stick to it until you are ready."[Karate](http://web-images.chacha.com/images/Gallery/4414/how-to-stop-smoking1634762281-aug-14-2012-1-600x676.jpg)Girl I was talking to cut herself often. I said I'd stop smoking if she quit cutting. "Can confirm 4 1/2 years of no cigarettes I quit cold turkey, the best thing I can say if learn to substitute."What worked for me is moving to vapor. I literally haven't had a craving for a cig yet but what I do crave is my ecig and I love every fucking bit of it.  "It took years of effort and self reflection before I finally quit.  I started in my teens and quit last year when I was 29.  My health wasn't the best.  Smoking was causing bad digestive issues.  I couldn't afford it at $5 a pack.  I had tried to quit maybe 5 or 6 times before and had managed to cut back quite a bit to like a pack a week.  Tried blu e-cigs and the gum.  

Finally, I started meditating and smoking weed.  I kind of went on a soul quest and found the weird little psychological mechanisms that kept me coming to back to it.  Once you figure that out, it's actually kind of easy.  I feel much better now.""i started riding my bike to work and realized that it would be less miserable to do so if i didn't smoke. i also realized that i would be doing my body a terrible disservice (health-wise) by smoking while doing something positive such as riding my bike, running, etc. once i started treating my body better (gym, running, cycling) i was more aware of how terrible smoking made me feel, therefore it made it easy to quit. ""I agree with other posts here; the easiest way to quit by far is cold turkey. I managed to quit for three months before going back but I'm working on quitting again. Yes the urge is still there but what nobody tells you is it gets easier and easier to say no, until the cravings turn from 'OMG MUST HAVE NICOTINE NOW' to 'hmm, I wouldn't mind a cig right now... nah better not'.  
Edit: my phone is dumb"I was just broke and couldn't afford to buy any. That got me to quit pretty quick lol"Started doing long cut, then a few weeks later pouches, then moved onto snus and finally just stopped craving it. It may not be the healthiest way but it worked for me.""I used the patch and avoided all my triggers such as drinking coffee or any booze at all.

I also waited until it was starting to get cold out so going outside to smoke would be totally unfun (I live in Canada and never smoke inside). "My husband used vapor cigs. "For me it was a matter of moving to a new city--I wasn't around my old smoker friends, no more job that I'd made a habit of smoking at on breaks, new apartment, etc.""""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" is a great book. Worked for me. ""I did it completely wrong and do not recommend my method. But since you asked...
Work was my trigger too (-along with driving). 
I switched from cigs to snus. If e-cigs had been as popular, I may have gone with them. This was about 5 years ago when they were first starting to appear. 
Anyway, the snus would ease the nicotine need and I would walk around the building to clear my head and kind of walk off the urge. 
It took about 3 months of that and I eventually realized I wasn't dependent on nicotine anymore and dropped them. ""> any advice?

crossfit""I know this probably doesn't fit your situation all too well but my grandmother was put on oxygen about a year ago (because of smoking of course) and was told that she couldn't smoke anymore, she kept on doing it anyways. She would take out the little nose piece and smoke on her back porch, but one day she forgot to take out the nose piece before smoking. The reaction from the cigarette and the oxygen created a fire blast inside her lungs and burnt her face. After that she somehow miraculously was able to call my aunt for help. Her air ways started to swell up and if the ambulance didn't arrive just in time she would have suffocated. I know it's an extreme case, but that is what made her quit after ~70 years of smoking, and is what made me never want to touch a cigarette.

TL;DR - My grandma's face and lungs exploded and then she quit smoking. ""Here is what I did:

1. Throw away any cigs you have around. If you're done, then you have to mean it.

2. Take some sick leave from work after your second day for as much as you can spare. Basically look at it like you are getting the flu and you need to take it easy.

3. After a week or so, the initial physical withdrawal won't be near as bad, but you need to stay vigilant. Don't let yourself think ""Well, I feel better, I'm sure one smoke won't hurt.""""This is simplistic but it is truly a matter of just quitting.  That's what it was for me, I just decided that I wasn't going to smoke anymore.  It's literally as simple as just not buying that next pack.  

Start running or walking on a break, that's what I've taken to do.  It releases stimulants from exercising as you get from smoking (not the same ones of course) but you'll feel a buzz and be happy you didn't smoke.  "Never stop quitting.Hate.  Find someone who you hate that smokes.  Bet him/her $1000 that s/he will smoke before you.  Revel in the stubborn hate that you will NOT be paying that asshole $1000."Watch Barbra Tarbox videos.  Look her up on youtube, there's a bunch.  I was a pack and a half per day smoker for 22 years, after seeing her on tv, I never touched one again. It's been 13 years since I quit. Good luck, you won't regret it.""i got black-out drunk and smoked about 5 packs in a 5-7 hour time span. I woke up the next morning, unaware of the amount I smoked the night before, attempted to light up a cigarette, vomitted everywhere, and haven't smoked since."Electric cigarette. "I quit 6 years ago and don't have any desire for them any more. Here's how I did it.

First, you have to really want to quit. Be honest and set a quit day some days or weeks in the future.

I read this book before my quit day: http://amzn.com/0615482155 

Then I spent $100 on a hypnotherapy session. I think this helped to break down some of the mental patterns smoking puts you in. It was really relaxing and enjoyable for me, but it might depend on who you use.

I quit cold-turkey, it was a little rough for a couple weeks, but then got better by the day. Now I don't mind being around cigarette smoke (as long as it's not too thick) and it worked well for me. Go for it!

""Like most people I have seen comment on here, I also quit cold turkey. I started smoking when I was 16 and finally quit when I was around 28. I decided I didn't want to smoke anymore. I would get winded from doing simple things like walking up a flight of stairs, my fingers, hair, car, clothes reeked of cigarette smoke (GROSS!) and I was getting sick with Bronchitis at least once to twice a year. By the end of 12 years of smoking, I had also developed a pretty gnarly smoker's cough which definitely is not sexy. Hacking up my lungs EVERY morning became a routine. Aside from that, my pack a day habit was becoming very expensive. At this time cigarettes were around 4-5 a pack (not sure how much they are now) but I knew there were lots of things I would rather spend $120-$150 a month on. One day, I woke up and I said to myself ""Im done. I'm not going to smoke today.""

The important thing to remember with something like this is to not look too far ahead. Don't focus on how you are going to get through the week without cigarettes. Focus on getting through the next hour, the rest of the day, then the next day. 

Another important thing (and you HAVE to commit to this) is that it is absolutely CRUCIAL that you remove yourself from any situation where you would want to smoke. For me, it was bars and drinking in general. I knew that drinking would absolutely trigger me to want to smoke and that I would definitely give in. So I also decided at that time that I would quit drinking. It was only supposed to be temporary but the health benefits were so great that I quit drinking altogether. I might have a glass of wine or champagne once or twice a year, but ultimately I no longer drink socially. You have to treat it like what it is: an addiction. Which means you should also remove yourself from any situation where others will be smoking (like friends that smoke or co-workers that smoke). Find a distraction or different vice. I used licorice, hard candy and/or coffee. 

The places that require the most discipline to not smoke are in the car while driving and after a big meal. You can't really remove yourself from those situations so those are the times when you have to call on your discipline to stop you from lighting up. I would make sure I always had my favorite CD's in the car (hey, it was the early '00s) and I would play all my favorite songs and sing along with them. It sounds stupid but it worked for me. It gave my mouth something to do other than smoking (insert dirty joke here). 

The HARDEST part is getting through the first week. But by the end of your second week you will begin to see the cravings decrease. In my opinion, the biggest factors in quitting smoking are determination (you have to really want it) and discipline. Your mind is very powerful. You can do this! Good luck!
""I simply quit buying them. Smoked for 15 years, decided one morning I didn't want to do it anymore. I believe you have to actively quit. By that I mean instead of avoiding the triggers that made me want to smoke, like smokey bars, drinking, and my friends who all smoke, I sought those situations out and made myself refrain.

You can do it, ditch the e-cig, and quit buying real ones. When you want a break go outside and stand around the smokers. Convince yourself what they are doing is gross. Active quitting, you got this!"I just quit.  Nothing works unless you want it as bad as you have ever wanted something.  I quit about 15 years ago and never looked back.  I quit cold turkey after smoking a pack a day for 5 years.It's just like when someone says they need to go to the gym and continue to sit on their ass.  You have to really decide that it is something that you want to do and follow through.  There aren't really any tricks.  You have to really want to quit and just do it.  "I smoked 20 years, mainly unfiltered or full flavored cigs.  Had ""unrelated"" lung surgery, quit then.  Kinda easy with a PICC line and Percocet.  Lol, was my 3rd quit.  Once for a couple of years, once for a year.  Been 8 years now.  ""I started at 13 and (successfully) quit at 27, but I tried to quit many times over the years. I even quit during my pregnancies, but it was only a hiatus-I knew I could start again once my kids were born. I tried the patch and weening and stuff, but it didn't work until I just stopped. No help, no whining or excuses. I just stopped. I think it works so well because if you can get through the hell of those first few weeks without smoking, you: 1. Don't want to ever go through that again, and 2. Know that you are capable of succeeding on your own. It makes a big difference. My motivation for the last few times I quit was not wanting to touch my kids with my gross smoke-hands, and having a reason that really mattered to me was important, too. When it was ""just for me"" it wasn't worth it because I liked smoking. Good luck!""Why? Whenever I laid down at the end of the day, like to sleep, I would wheeze. Sexy times with the lady friend? Wheeze. That wheeze motivated me to quit. How? The gum. When I had the itch, that's how I scratched it, until I didn't itch so much anymore. "realizing that the cravings never really go away. you just end up filling the void better the more time you spend away from cigarettes. I switched to e cigs and lowered the amount of nicotine included in the liquid each refill. now I don't smoke anything since the nicotine craving faded away over time especially when I began smoking non nicotine liquid. It's been about 4 months and before that I was smoking for a good 2 or 3 years with another 11 months of quitting before that. Maybe once or twice a month I'll get the cravings and my brain will try to convince myself to pick it up again. They go away fairly quickly though. I'm not concerned"Pneumonia.  I spent two weeks in India and got sick, really sick.  After coming back I tried to smoke,  but after taking a puff or two the coughing would hurt so bad that I just had to quit.  I've been cigarette free for two years now. ""People don't grasp what I'm saying when I say this, but I'll try anyway: Don't buy cigarettes anymore.

Seriously. That's it. Don't buy them. They cost money you don't have, and you get literally nothing good out of it. So when you crave a cigarette, just don't buy any. 

I just decided one day that smoking wasn't worth it, and that I wouldn't buy them anymore because I could use that money for much better things. 

After a while whenever I got a craving, I'd just remind myself that hey, I've come this far, I wouldn't want it to be for nothing.

Smoked for 13 years and quit cold turkey 5 years ago."I quit cold turkey after several half-assed quitting attempts over two decades. The cold turkey response was initiated by my heart attack at age 37. Pretty good motivator. Keep at trying to quit and good luck."Don't give up on e-cigs. Try a different type of setup, or different flavors. You'll always find something you like the most and will soon find how awful cigarettes taste and smell. There's a realm of knowledge about e-cigs to delve into, you just gotta find what works for you the best.""I have quit several times for various reasons during the 14 years that I smoked. The first time I quit for an extended period of time was for about two years, and it was for monetary reasons. Obviously, it didn't hold. I haven't had a cigarette since October of last year because, for the first time, I decided to quit for my health.

The moment I really realized just what was happening every time I took a drag it was almost like a sudden clarity washed over me. The next step was just a matter of willpower. It makes it all the more sweet to know that my will is stronger than the addiction. I don't even think about them anymore.""I used the patch and that helped me through the first few weeks of withdrawals. I started forgetting to put it on and then would just carry one in my pocket, in case I needed it. 

What *really* did it though was getting sick and fucking tired of being chained to the addiction. It just became and expensive pain in the ass for me.

Been clean for over a year and a half now. Woot.

""The enforced ban (approximately 2 years ago) on smoking at work was the beginning of the end of my smoking (after 20+ years). 

At first I only smoked in the morning before work, at lunch and at night after, then it was just in the evening.  Soon I would ""forget"" to smoke in the evenings and slowly went from 1/2 pack a day to 2-3 a day to 1 every day or so to a couple a week to a couple a month and then finally to zero on July 4th 2011. 


""Read up a bit on why smoking is addictive.  Learn how nicotine is reprogramming your brain.  When you look at your next cigarette not as a fix, but as a tool that is insidiously reprogramming the connections in your brain to make you want to reuse it, it's not nearly as appealing.

Another strategy I've heard worked well is to throw a full pack of cigs away.  Just straight to the garbage.  Don't give them away, don't save them for a rainy day, don't smoke them down telling yourself its your last pack.  Pitch them.  That act of viewing your cigs not as a valuable resource, but as something harmful that you want to get rid of, can do wonders for your willpower next time your at the store looking at another pack."But what happens if you want to die and believe that your life is made that little bit better by cigarettes? "watch ""dying at grace"" a documentary. it's available online free to stream.

Anytime I feel myself getting temperamental, impatient, fiendy, etc. I remind myself its because of ME and any outlash is a result of MY lack of self control. Stop saying its the cigarettes, because its not. Its you.""When I first started trying to quit I tried reducing consumption, the I'll only smoke/chew when I drink or on special occasions routine.  After unsuccessfully trying for a few years I eventually figured out that I had to quit completely without exception.  Then I had a last cigarette and never did it again (except I did smoke part of a cigar last year).  It will be 6 years in June and I still occasionally get quite strong nicotine cravings.  When you do quit avoid going to a store when you are hungry or emotionally drained when you will be less likely to resist the urge to buy just a pack. "Getting a girlfriend that made me quit. "Champix, old people, and eating everything.  Champix really is a magical thing.  I don't know WTF it's called in other countries.  Anyway, it took care of the urge to smoke in about two weeks, but then I still had to shove things in my mouth, and had all kinds of weird stresses and mood swings as various toxins left.  I shoved so much food in my mouth that I gained almost 40 lbs. in two months.  I looked pregnant and everything jiggled.  Soooo, then I started the fitness thing up pronto.


I had planned on quitting, anyway, but a visit to a seniors' home hardened my resolve.  None of them were smokers.  Smokers don't make it that far...

That gave me the push I needed because cigarettes became less and less important. Then my SO quit a few weeks later which really helped alot. Our house quickly became a non-smoking house and that's been since early October. I can now sit with smokers and not get the urge to take a puff. I only took the two month trial of Chantix (started it in September) but I know some people have problems with it. My SO says after two to three weeks the craving slow dramatically. Just get it in your head and you'll do it. It honestly feels great to be free of that burden.""On my mom's behalf: Nicotine Patches

On a few friend's behalfs: e-cigs.  They don't feel pressured to quit as badly, so they don't feel the stress keeping them from quiting.  They've been cutting back little by little for a while comfortably."Getting knocked up! "The key to my success in quitting was changing my mentality. I bought my last pack of smokes and made it last a month. During this time the most challenging obstacle was over coming the anxiety from cravings. I would have to give myself positive affirmations, telling myself ""you're gonna be ok. No harm will come to you if you don't light up."" Which is what anxiety is. It's your body warning you something bad will happen if you don't get what you need. You must convince yourself you don't need nicotine. Remind yourself of the life you lived before you became a smoker. It's not gonna be easy. But it gets easier as time goes on, and you will become more confident in your ability to defeat those cravings.

The other point I want to make is also coming to terms with the reality that you are not just quitting for a month and then you can smoke again. You shouldn't have the cigarettes as a reward. You gotta tell yourself and understand that you are NEVER smoking again. This is a life change. Keep telling yourself these things over and over and you will begin to believe it. Your mind is powerful, get it on your side and you can achieve anything. Good luck to you.""Smoked for 15 years, i got sick with bronchitis and I just couldnt do it anymore. 2 years later I have only smoked when I'm on vacation and barely even finish a full pack when i do that.  I just find it disgusting now unless I'm the one doing it. It smells gross, looks gross and I want to be there for my potential kids. Don't give up and don't get discouraged.  Good luck!""I've been quit for just a little over 13 months. I smoked about a pack a day for seven years. I quit cold turkey, not because I wanted to, but because I lost my job and cigarettes were a luxury I just could not afford. I've got a new job now, but it's been nice being able to breathe and taste so I haven't gone back."Hope someone sees this. Never smoked cigarettes daily but I always liked the occasional cigarello. One in the morning one at night. I occasionally had some at social events. But I always labelled myself as a non smoker and never ever let my work colleagues know or see me smoke. My friends know I did. I've stopped now because i was paranoid I'd start smoking cigarettes daily. I just stopped cold turkey. It was easy to stop since I never smoked during work hours amd always saw myself as a non smoker because that is what my work colleagues saw of me. I stopped because my sense of taste amd smell was diminishing and my lungs felt scratchy. Weed helps curb the symptoms Sunflower seeds"Cold Turkey is the only thing that worked for me.  Don't think about next week or next month remind yourself of why you want to quit today.  Step outside with the other smokers and challenge yourself to talk to them but not smoke.  Don't brag that you are quitting, it gives a sense of false accomplishment, just do it.  It gets a lot easier after about 3 weeks.  Good luck."Wanting to quit.An electronic cigarette. I tried everything before it. "if you can handle psychedelic dreams, i would strongly recommend Chantex.  I smoked for 25 years and  was on Chantex for 3 months.  it worked great!""This might be gross, but I smoked until I barfed. That was such a strong and negative association that ever since then even just the smell of cigarettes triggers intense nausea. That won't work for everyone but it did for me. 5 years now! Good luck to you :)""It was back in 2001 and I had this little app running on my laptop that I wish I could remember the name.  You put in how many you smoke a day and the average cost of a pack.  It kept a running total of # of cigarettes I didn't smoke, money saved, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds since last cigarette, and how much of my life I was saving by not smoking.  I think it used the 7 minutes per cigarette estimate.  Ultimately, after the initial 2 weeks of ""yay I'm quitting for real!"" that kept me going, I was driven by a desire to not have to reset the counters.  Its a bit OCD I guess, but it helped.""The gum. Use the gum. Even if you chew it indefinitely, you may be addicted to nicotine, but you're not harming yourself. In my experience, it pays to splurge a bit on the ones that don't taste like shit."My girlfriend at the time told me I could keep smoking but she wouldn't kiss me after I have smoked. Quit that day."I went from 20+ a day to 0 by investing in a e-cig, if you still find yourself wanting to smoke real cigarettes after using a ecig then you should up the MG in your juice. Head over to /r/electronic_cigarette  really helpful people and loads of guides for people looking to quit or have already quit and are struggling. "I smoked 1.5 packs a day for 6 years. I quit the day I bought an electronic cigarette. I used the e cig for about 1 year and put it down and haven't touched it since. I have been 3 years smoke free and 2 years without the e cig. The e cig works seamlessly. A proper setup will feel like smoking. Avoid gas station e cigs at all costs. They are cheap and disposible. "I smoked for about ten years.  Sometimes a few cigarettes a month, sometimes half a pack a day for weeks.  There was no pattern.  I had a kid and just stopped.  I still smoke a few cigarettes once every couple months when I find some time to go out with friends.  I have never once had a really strong craving, except when drunk, but it wasn't any worse than wanting some ice cream and deciding not to have some.  I have e-cigarettes, but I never really got into them.""I questioned myself a lot. And it turned out I actually didn't like to smoke. It was a habit, sure, difficult to quit, but I worked up the courage to seriously and wholeheartedly make the decision to not do it any more. 

I used the date the new anti-smoking law came into power in my country. It severely limited the kind of store that could sell cigs, so if I wanted any I'd actually have to drive to get them. So, being lazy, it worked for me. First week was pretty bad, then I was just happy I quit.""As an ex smoker who failed at least a dozen times trying to quit, the thing that worked best for me was getting in the mindeset that I was not a smoker anymore. You seriously have to want to quit, or you never will. Telling youself "" oh one cigarette won't hurt"" is not okay. It has to be all or nothing. You have to make it part of your identity. You identify yourself as a nonsmoker and that's just what you are. Also, not being around other smokers is very beneficial. I tried to find  other habits other than smoking also. I started going on runs or walks, going to the gym, or reading. I find  going to the gym helps relieve some built up stress that comes with quitting nicotine.""The cold-turkey proponents will probably down-vote me to hell, but I haven't had a smoke in over a year since I switched to [e-cigs](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/).  The science is finally coming out to validate the safety of these devices.  The nicotine liquids, when purchased from a reputable dealer, are safe.  The quit rate for users is higher than with FDA-approved nicotine replacement methods like the patch or gum.  These have been a god-send for me."I used getting my wisdom teeth out as a catalyst to quit. The night before the procedure I had my last smoke and I was done. I couldn't have smoked and not gotten nasty dry socket.  It helped me to be in a situation where I couldn't smoke. Basic training"Champix completely destroyed my cravings, and I found it super easy to avoid smoking.

However, it also made me want to kill myself.. I got incredibly depressed within a couple weeks, and had major problems sleeping, so use with caution.

Bupropion (wellbutrin) also reduced my cravings quite a bit, but I was not taking it as an aid to quit smoking. I started smoking just one a day, and I'm sure it would have been much easier to quit than if I went cold turkey."Laser cessation therapy. After 16 years as a heavy smoker it's the only thing that worked. "Cold Turkey. A piece of Nicorette when it got too hard. Aside from that, just good old willpower""What worked in the end was my willingness to use every crutch available to me at the time and to make quitting my number one priority.  I smoked 2 packs a day for 30 years and am now smoke-free for 10+ years.  I truly did not think I'd ever be able to quit.  

What I did:

*I used patches AND nicotine gum together

*i scaled back the size of the patches very slowly and chewed a couple of pieces of gum everyday for a year

*I went to www.quitnet.com every morning where I talked about quitting everyday and posted an oath not to take a single puff that day.  

*I read Alan Carr's book, cognitive therapy help-sites, everything I could about how nicotine works in the blood and on the brain, and details about the poisons in tobacco

* my most original and helpful technique - I filled a cigarette pack with licorice sticks (twizzlers).  In my previous failed attempts to quit smoking, all day long for weeks I'd have a craving and start reaching for a pack of smokes before I was really conscious of doing it.  When I didn't find one, I'd remember that I quit smoking and time after time I'd feel a crushing disappointment. By the end of the day, all that added up and wore me and my resolve down. 
By having my cigarette package there to reach for, I'd have the familiar (and comforting) habit of sliding the pack open and finding something inside I enjoyed.  It wasn't my drug, but it wasn't disappointment, either.  Sometimes I'd inhale through the licorice.  Damn, that worked great. I did that for a month or so.  
"I smoked for two years. I quit with the help of getting sick. I was sick for two weeks with the flu and it was the only time I was actually grateful for being sick."So I quit as of this new year, used to smoke anywhere from 5-15 a day depending on circumstances. Drinking, what friends I was around, and decided finally to call it quits. 

It's a hard task, but the main fact is that you have to be mentally prepared to quit. 

Being mentally prepared is an extremely difficult task, much like being prepared mentally to stick to a work out routine. That's just it - it's a routine. You will notice that most of your smoking follows a routine. Get in the car - smoke a cig. Go out for some drinks - buy a pack. List goes on and on for instances such as those. 

But to put simply: 

1) Change your mind set
2) Change your surroundings; challenge yourself to do something else when thinking about smoking --- For me I started boxing and dieting... lung improvement has kept me from smoking !!!
3) Money... huge factor savings of over 1000$+ a year


Good luck... and just fyi I pulled the old cold turkey. Yes... You will have headaches, yearn for cigs etc etc, but hte fact of hte matter is your are saving yourself a lot of time, money, and effort that you will have to spend on a later date. The sooner the better. Cheers""Stop with the patches, gum, e-cigs, or whatever crutch you're using. They're all excuses to keep dosing yourself nicotine. Realize that your own mind is your worst enemy and treat everything it tells you about smoking with suspicion, just as if it were a shady used car salesman. The addicted mind will go to great lengths to convince you it's OK to get nicotine in some way or another, but don't listen to it. I had to treat my brain like it was an alien invader in my body bent on destroying me. Once I had that perspective it was easier to 'punish' my brain every time it tried to convince me to smoke or wear a patch. ""Oh yeah?"" I'd say, ""now you get a 5-mile bike ride uphill! Take that you stupid bitch. Wanna try again?"" That was 11 years ago after smoking a pack a day for 18 years. I haven't even had a single hit since.""I picked a date and stuck with it.  It was a Sunday. I had about 3 cigarettes left in my pack. I drove to a gym, signed up for a membership, and smoked my last cigarette on my way to Wawa for a sub.  That was about 5 years ago. "I chewed tobacco for about a year till I finally got tired of everyone making fun of me.Been 7 years now nicotine free.Will power.  Make the decision and do it.  It's your body.  Make it do what you want."I started smoking when I was 13, and I hit a point I was going through about 2 packs a day.

I attempted to quit before, but it was always due to external factors, like a girlfriend wanted me to. I'd eventually go back because I didn't want to quit, someone else wanted me to.

I decided I want to lose a large amount of weight after college, and when I started exercising I was hacking up something awful. I realized if I wanted to be healthy and happy, I had to quit.

TL;DR I needed only true internal motivation to quit cold turkey. 7 years smoke-free.""Disassociation + Cold Turkey. First I stopped smoking at all the times I habitually smoke (in the morning when I got up, after / with coffee etc).

Made cold turkey easier cause I was already used to not smoking at those critical times.

I also booked a week off work to avoid people. That was 8 years ago! (after 10 failed attempts with helper products)""i would not recommend this - but, some guy told me not to cut down to lights and ultra lights, but instead go to camel straights, pall malls, and lucky strikes - 2 to 3 packs a day. sure enough after a year or so i woke up in the middle of the night and coughed up the most disgusting black jelly. the shit came out of my nose and i gagged on it. by that time my fingers were brown, my apartment, clothes, car, smelled like death and i couldnt taste anything unless it was smothered in salt and tabasco. i coughed like marlboro man with whooping cough, tb, and lung cancer. that was it, I reached my breaking point. i quit cold turkey. it was still rough, but it's been 15+ years and I definitely never crave one now. the smell makes me sick. so thats how i did it, but once again would not recommend it. i was young so my body could take it , also.""One day I went back to doing things I would always enjoy doing as I would in my younger years of growing up.

I'm approaching 19 this year, but 6 months ago I started playing games with my best friend, or brother as you will. We grew up together, and had a ball doing the things we enjoyed.

So much nostalgia when I re-subbed for World of Warcraft with him one day randomly and we just played and played and would just do stupid activities and have fun. Due to that it just made me not want to smoke. I don't crave cigarettes, or even think about it to this day. It's weird, but I'm just shocked I haven't lit one up in so long. 
Ended up stopping drinking a lot since then, maybe one or two every month if that now! 

My mum is very happy with my decision and so am I :)""Having a kid did it for me; the realization that I wouldn't be just hurting myself, but possibly robbing my son of his father is very, very powerful. Once my wife and I started trying to get pregnant, I threw out the pack and never bought another one.

Not sure I'd recommend having a baby just to quit smokingÛ? but maybe reframing the stakes for yourself.""Not me, but my grandpa went for a very long hike with only a bag of salted shell peanuts and some water. He came back, never smoked again. ""Come to terms with the statement ""I will never take another drag, from another cigarette, for the remainder of my life."" 
Zyban helps, e-cigs help, but ultimately you need to decide that you don't want to smoke EVER AGAIN.  Not socially, not when you are drinking, not when you are at work.  Zyban worked for me because it acted as a buffer between my discipline to keep from smoking, and my addict brain to continue smoking.   
I would say if you are going to smoke, smoke the e-cig. ""The patch gave me terrible dreams - would not recommend.

Really, it's barreling through the withdrawal. It's not easy, and you're going to be a nervous wreck with terrible side effects for a few weeks. But once you come out the other side you'll feel so independent.

I also recommend using things to calm the oral fixation. I carried a bottle of water around with me for weeks.""The Polar Vortex. It's been too damn cold to smoke outside, so I accidentally quit, so that works."Nothing."Cold turkey here too. The way the brain works is that something that happens occasionally is always going to potentially be on the menu and you will always be looking for it. The thing that keeps something in loop and allows you to remember to buy that thing at the store you thought about last week, will also keep your mind searching for the cigarettes that come sometimes...all the time. Cutting down never works. The day I said I'm done I never so much as took a puff again.

You suffer and you say to yourself ""This is it, it will never hurt worse than today. It will only get better"". Treat it like a break up, because that's what it is. At the point I quit I could barely remember when I didn't smoke and cigarettes were the most constant thing in my life every day. Like most, I liked smoking but my body didn't. That's the truth of it, it comes down to patience and pain tolerance... and for a 15yr. 1.5 pk a day smoker it didn't take that long to be on the better side of things.

I took up cycling and eating better at the same time. It did wonders to burn off the anxiety. I surrounded myself with activities that reminded me I was taking a stand and participating in my health. Denying yourself a habit is one thing, actively participating is other healthy activities really offsets that void. ""Two things. One was deciding to start a family, and knowing that I didn't want my kids to be exposed that. The other more practical approach I took was to gradually cut back. I got down to one a day, and thought this is stupid, and then I quit. Went without for a couple weeks,  then feel of the wagon one night. After waking up the next morning and bring barely able to breathe, that was it. Haven't smoked since. Good luck to you!""Turning 40, having 2 young kids, and pains in my chest when I took deep breaths. "Quitting drinking at the same time."First you have to decide you actually want to quit. once i made the choice for myself, (not because my husband was telling me to, or because my parents were on my ass), i stocked up on sunflower seeds and toothpicks. Sunflower seeds helped for when i was outside or in my car. otherwise, just keeping a toothpick in my mouth helped calm the urges. the chemical addiction is gone after 3 days, the rest is all mental. You got this. ""Willpower first of all, followed by a replacement ""ritual"" really helped me. The cravings are really tough the first couple of days but eventually pass, just force yourself to do something else everytime you have a craving, whether it's a little gesture, which is what I replaced it with, along with repeating a mantra in my mind everytime I got a craving.

I'm coming up on 5 years w/out a cigarette and can say the cravings mostly pass, although there will ALWAYS be times, especially when stressed, when I want one. ""Cold turkey worked best for me, I used toothpicks the time before last and stayed off em for 28 months. ""I got pregnant. When I found out, I immediately halved the amount I was smoking. It took me about 3 weeks to be completely smoke free. I wished I could have quit cold turkey, but finding out I was pregnant was crazy stressful, and when I'm stressed I smoke.

It my not be feasable for you to get pregnant, but it worked for me!""It really was just having the utmost desire to quit.

To get that desire I had to go through a lot. First I grew up with my father as a smoker, and I hated it. Then in my teens he dated a woman who was a smoker, I hated it too. She had even quit once (but started smoking in front of me again on my birthday I was pissed). 

Of course later in my teen years, peer pressure, desire to be cool, following in my parents footsteps, etc. I started smoking. I got pretty heavy into it and was a pack a day guy within a couple of years. I tried to quit many many times but really didn't have enough motivation to go through with it.

Then I watched my father die of cancer. It was heartbreaking, and the memory of sitting next to him in his bedroom as he took his final breath haunts me to this day. But even that wasn't enough.

What finally got it to stick was deciding to have a kid ... I didn't want her to grow up and watch me die the same way. So I got the patch and 2 weeks later I ditched that. I haven't been a smoker since (I relapsed once for a night a few months later but thats it). Its ultimately my desire to want to set a good standard for my daughter that keeps me off of it. I still get the cravings and its been 12 years since I quit. ""I smoked weed everytime I wanted to smoke a cigarette. Not to get high...just to smoke. I would smoke 5-10 joints a day. After a couple weeks, I got sick of being high all the time. 2 years into quitting now. Wouldnt even call myself a smoker anymore, and I don't smoke weed anymore either!!!""Chantix was my savior. Tried several times without and just couldn't do it. After about a week of taking it the 'buzz' you get goes away and cigs taste HORRIBLE. You also are cutting back during the week because you don't have that pressure as often or as strong. So then you stop. It will suck for a couple of days, you will be grumpy, you will have CRAZY VIVID dreams. These dreams can be bad if you have bad dreams anyway, I fortunately, do not have that problem. 
For me at about a month or so in the pills started making me nauseous, this happens to a lot of people, but I just started cutting the pills in half and that let me taper off of them. 
The first time I did this I went about three years without. Then made the mistake of smoking one night when drunk. Then started back within the next month. Did the cycle again and now haven't smoked in a couple of years. The urges still exist but when I get them and they are bad I tell my self that if I smoke one, then I will smoke 10,000 and it just isn't worth it.""First, you need to be yourself totally sick of smoking and have this incessant desire to quit. You must be totally convinced in the head that smoking is disgusting and there's absolutely NO good reason you should smoke another cigarette in your life.

Once you get there, just quit cold turkey. Man up and ride out the urges the first few weeks.""Social pressure. None of my friends smoke. I work in the health care field. None of my colleagues smoke. The ones that did, quit. When I go outside to smoke a cigarette, I get bored. That's it, really. ""Sunflower seeds.  But then I had to use cigarettes to kick my seeds addiction.

But in all seriousness cold turkey worked for me.  You just need to be strong as shit.  Working retail jobs don't help either.
""Triple bypass surgery did it for my uncle. He was loving those menthols since he was an army cook in Korea. If he can quit, anyone can. ""I started to play soccer at a indoor league. At first I switched to dip to help with the nicotine cravings then stopped the dip slowly. I felt like soccer gave me relatively quick feedback for quitting. good luck
"My uncles death from lung cancer (lifetime smoker).it's you vs yourself in this situation.  who will come out on top?  What worked for me (second attempt) was quitting cold turkey but with an actual reason to quit. The reason was my willpower on bad days. I also set out to develop a new way to cope with stress since that was when I felt most dependant on cigarettes. I would remove myself from any stressful situation at the first opportunity and take a walk for a couple of minutes. Good luck!"Pregnancy. Had to quit cold turkey, totally worked out.""Quite simple, actually.

I got sick of being out of breath, smelling, and doing something I knew was shit for my overall well being. So I quit. No goals, deals, gimmicks or games. 

Its all willpower and mental strength. I didn't need ""gum"" or ""lollipops"" to offset the cravings. It was quite simple, actually. I feel those who say its so hard don't really have the desire to quit, they just think they do.

SOURCE: Smoked for 10 years, nearly 1.5-2 packs a day. Put them down 3 years ago and haven't had one since.""When I quit, it was two months after I got to watch my grandfather die of lung cancer, and I decided that's not the way I want to go.  For me the memory of his last few weeks really helped me through the trying times.  I used an e-cig as a crutch for about a week, moved to the nicotine-free cartridges, and really, kept drinking a ton of water.  I was never so hydrated.  Cigarette cravings seemed to decrease after slamming 20 oz of cold water.  Doing non-smoking activities (go to the movies, bowling, keep your hands and mind occupied).  One of my friends gave me a stress ball that I kept in my coat pocket that I used while walking around outside, when I would usually be smoking.  Driving was difficult, we don't realize the rituals we set for ourselves until we try to change them.  Once again, water and LOUD music seemed to get me over this hump.  But mostly, I really really really wanted it.  There's no magic bullet.  It's going to suck, and it's going to suck a lot.  But having that motivation is what grinds you through.  For me it was not wanting my kids to go through what my mom and uncles went through with their dad, that slow decline, that agonizing end.  But it could be anything.  Money you save.  Your general health.  Lower insurance rates.  As long as that's stronger than the temporary desire to light up, you'll get through this.  Signed, ex-smoker of 16 years, tobacco free for three."I was put on wellbutrin for mild depression.  The pills didn't help my mood....but they made me never want to smoke. It actually looked gross to me after I started.  I'm still smoke free. Hooray! A family member of mine was diagnosed with lung cancer and the day that happened was the day I quit cold turkey and haven't had any problems since.  Its been 2 years and I feel fine."I went cold turkey and just refused to allow myself to take even one puff.  Don't tell yourself ""I'll just have one puff"" or ""I'll just have one cigarette."". That's your addiction playing tricks on you, next thing you know you bought a pack and are back to your normal level of smoking.

What also helped was starting the quit when I was sick and smoking would have made me feel worse.  When I felt better I thought ""Well, I just went two days without smoking, might as well keep it going"".

Good luck.""For me, I quit using the Nicorette inhaler.  Any brand inhaler will work.  What REALLY helped me was ignoring the filter 90% of the time.  They say you go through 2-3 a day when you smoke 1/2 - 1 pack a day, but I went through maybe 3 a week.  I would inhale on it knowing that there was no nicotine left in the filter, but the hand-to-mouth gesture was enough of a reminder to trick my brain into thinking I wasn't jonesing for nicotine.

I recommend people to find a reason to quit as well, rather than just ""yeah I should quit"".  My reason was that my girlfriend HATED it, plus I was becoming a Resident Assistant for my dorms and I didn't want to be the only RA who smoked.""I used Chantix. The dreams were weird but fun, though towards the end I noticed I was a little more on edge than normal. I  quit for a year but relapsed due to a stressful situation and basically allowing myself to restart. I did Chantix again and have stayed away ever since. It also helps knowing (and if it's not true I still prefer ignorance)  that insurance will only pay twice in a lifetime for it. Knowing I can't get it again is a powerful deterrent. ""Quit 75 days ago. What helped me was an e-cig with a small amount of nicotine in the juice. Used it for about two weeks, smoking less and less every day until I didn't need it anymore. You can get juice with no nicotine in it, which helps with the habit and feeling of smoking. Also, being serious about quitting helps. All of my failed attempts in the past were from not really wanting to quit but feeling like I should. ""Vaping.

/r/electronic_cigarette ""My husband bought me a vaporizer pen (kanger) and I started alternating between it and smoking, then when I ran out of cigarettes I just didn't buy anymore and used the pen exclusively. I've been smoke free for a month. The e-cig did nothing for me, with the vaporizer you can control how much nicotine yiu actually get. Good luck, you can do this."I was put on wellbutrin for mild depression.  The pills didn't help my mood....but they made me never want to smoke. It actually looked gross to me after I started.  I'm still smoke free. Hooray! "I quit smoking a year ago. What worked for me was cold turkey, find the reason you want to quit and stick at it. I was a pack a day smoker for 15 years.

I had tried to quit smoking several times over the years and was always tripped up by ""Sure one won't hurt"" or ""I'll only smoke at weekends"" or ""I'll only smoke when I'm drinking"" or ""I'll only when I'm in company"". There's no such thing. You just got to stick at it.

When I quit I read advice on the /r/stopsmoking sub, someone said that as Nicotine is carried in the blood, you need to clean your blood as soon as possible. How you do this is eat loads of fiber and anti-oxidents (blueberries, pineapple), and basically have the greatest bowel movements of your life for 2 weeks.


What also helped me was making fists with your toes everytime you want a cig.

Be warned though, I may be a year in, but there isn't a day goes by without me still thinking I'd love a cigarette. I was at a party last week and of course, all the smokers are outside laughing and having fun, I was stuck inside with a bore. I went out to join the smokers, I didn't have a cigarette but I really wanted one.""Having my father died, I was in my early twenties and when my father died due to lung cancer it convinced everyone in my family who smoked that we should quit or we'll end up the same way.""I quit twice. The first time was because I said I would, and so I did. It lasted about three months, and when I got the opportunity to start up again I did. I thought at the time I would just have a smoke or two and no big deal but pretty soon I was back on the horse, looking for my stetson.

The second time, I just did it. I didn't even know it was going to happen on that day. It was at the point where I was embarrassed to admit to people I met that I smoked. I wanted to quit and I was just trying to figure out when and where to do it. One day I woke up, and I was like ""I think I'm done."" I threw away my leftover cigarettes and didn't buy any more.

That was over 15 years ago now. I still dream, every now and again, about how I have an occasional smoke, or how I pick up the habit for a couple weeks at a time then quit all over again. I don't dare.

I think what made it easier for me was that I simply did not go places where smoking was a part of the social fabric of things. Early on I really missed the break it gave me -- 10 minutes every couple hours hanging out with the other smokers. These days I don't miss it so much.

Cold turkey wasn't easy, but it was easier than anything else I tried. The second time I tried it, I knew what I was in for, and I just never let my resolve waver.""honestly, stop trying to replace it with anything. 

I did not go 100% cold turkey, i used a patch for a week or two.

But i had friends who tried to quit around the same time and they're still smoking, and i quit 13 years ago.

The mistakes i saw them make:

Trying to go out and party while quitting, the first few weeks will be hard so don't put yourself in situations where you love to smoke. I just worked a lot.

taking the patch off to 'just have one'. Seriously?

Trying to quit right before we went on vacation. I had this one friend who would attempt to quit right before we would go on a yearly two week road trip when college ended. That was doomed to always fail and cause him stress.

To quit...you just have to quit. Just don't do it!

The crappy feeling will go away. The daily roller coaster of 'i feel great' to 'i feel like crap' will be replaced with...'i feel fine'.

My advice is harsh because i do not have an addictive nature, so it's like when you ask someone how to do something that they have been doing for a long time, ""I don't know, you just do it"".

Truth is, the only way to quit...is to quit. To stop smoking.

These e-cigs and stuff are nice but honestly i feel like you're just leaning off one crutch for another. Stand up and do it..in this case don't do it.""So many things combined for the perfect storm, really. It was right after new years, my girlfriend had just quit, I had been leaning towards it for awhile but needed an extra push. I went out to breakfast one morning, decided I would shave my head. Hadn't shaved my head since I was in middle school. From that haircut, I never smoked a cigarette again. The first few weeks are the hardest, but now, it feels like I just never smoked, I almost never THINK about smoking, and that's the biggest thing.

In your case, I would say replace it with something else. Something similar but not bad for you, I used toothpicks. They cover the oral fixation pretty well. Also use the patch, it sounds silly, but you do actually get a serious buzz the first few times, and you get that nicotine rush. I never tried the e-cigs as a quitting method, but in my observations, I've seen people just go back and forth between them and there's not enough mental separation from the e-cig to a regular cig, so people regress too easily. Toothpicks, go out for a toothpick and cell phone break.
"I've battled with smoking tobacco for many years. I gave up smoking completely two years ago and haven't had one since. All I did was stop. No pills; no new habit. Just stopped."Who gives a shit how you quit, just quit. I used Chantix and it was the only thing that really helped me and I tried everything (the gum, patches, etc). It's been nearly five years since I quit and I haven't relapsed once. This is after 15+ years of smoking and Skoal. Biggest piece of advice I can give is do not think for a moment that you can ""just have one"". That is the biggest mistake I think people make. I took the medicine for 2 months (to the dude who has been on it for 6 years WTF?!?!)""I had just recovered from pneumonia for the 3rd time in a year.  The third time was so crippling that I was actually afraid I was going to die.  I remember when I first got sick that third time that I was thinking, ugh, I have to quit smoking until I'm better or it's going to take forever to get over it.  Then as each day passed and I kept getting worse and worse my thought process shifted from quitting until I was better to quitting for good or I would NEVER get better.  

It really scared me that I thought I was going to die and as a Mom I couldn't stand the thought of leaving my kid and having him be sad and  angry at me for letting myself die over a pack and a half a day cigarette habit.  It really sobered me to realize that, realistically, I was picking my cigarettes over him.  So, that was that.  I never picked up another cigarette after I recovered from that pneumonia and it's been officially 873 days.  I've not smoked 26,212 cigarettes and I've saved $6555.00 (thanks Quit.net for the daily reminder).  :)""I smoked for 15 years, about half a pack a day. So not heavy, but definitely addicted.  15 years and 30 days ago, I started taking wellbutrin (buproprion) and ten days after that, I stopped smoking.  Other than a few vivid and weird dreams the first week, I had no problems with it - in fact, I still take it as an anti-depressant.

I haven't had a cigarette since, nor do I want one.  Now when I walk past someone smoking, I can hardly breathe. I can't imagine how I ever smoked."ecigs and swedish snuss really helped me:)"My method:  not buying more.  That's that whole thing about ""quitting"".  You actually have to make an effort to purchase them.  Stop making that effort.  Have a little willpower.  Ok, have a lot of willpower, but STOP buying them.  Every time you go to buy some realize what a jerk you're being and just don't do it."[deleted]is that because the only people you know are wow players?"I quit smoking Dec 15th 2012. I used the patch for about 5 or 6 weeks. I used steps 1 and 2. In hindsight only having been about a 1/2 a pack a day smoker I could have probably just done step 2 and then step 3.

Edit: I had tried cold turkey about 5 other times with no success. After talking to my doctor he said to try nicotine replacement before trying meds like a chantix or something like that.""Thats what I did, something always brought me back though.

I'm down to < 5 a day, somedays < 2.   Hopeing to cut it out altogether soon, but patches are kind of iffy becuase they just hook me to a nice even supply of nicotine that makes smoking cigarettes like chasing the dragon.""I accidentally swapped to e-cigs without ever really intending to quit. 

I'd tried out the disposable ones you get in convenience stores and dismissed them as crap, but at a trade show the guy on the stand next to me was showing off his new toy (an ego twist) and raving about how great it was. . 

I'd just moved house at the time and was doing my best to avoid smoking indoors this time round. As his ego looked significantly better than the disposable ones, i thought it was worth a go as a stopgap and hope i'd have the discipline to go outside for the real thing.  

The assortment of kit i'd ordered arrived in due course, and for the next few days i didn't smoke atall, partly because i was playing with my new toy but mostly because the nicotine liquid i'd ordered myself was ridiculously strong and making my head spin (i'd assumed as a 40 a day smoker i'd want the highest strength available).

On the 4th day i decided to have a real smoke and was amazed at just how crappy it tasted, so i didn't have another. Around a month later curiosity got the better of me, and it was so foul i threw it away after the 2nd drag and announced to myself that i'd officially given up on cigarettes. 

While i know I've only moved the goal-posts a bit, as I'm still officially addicted to nicotine, I am nevertheless extremely happy with how e-cigs have worked out for me. (especially since i didn't intend quit in the first place, i view them more as an upgrade than a substitute.) ""FOR ME: I switched, temporarily to an electronic cigarette (eGo Twist, fruity yummy juice, 6mg nicotine) and replaced the reactionary cigarette smoking (after dinner, after getting laid, driving) with reactionary weed smoking. I'm disabled, so I could get away with doing this. I used the e-cig as maintenance throughout the day, a few hits here and there. It tasted good, I could smoke indoors, and it only cost me about 4 weeks of cigarette smoking, monetarily speaking - around $100.

I stopped buying Nicotine e-juice and just vape for flavor & muscle memory's sake. It's a way to keep ""smoking,"" but in a way that isn't AS harmful to myself and others. I spend MAYBE 20$ a month now on smoking, and I quit smoking copious amounts of weed after the second week. Now I'm back to being a casual daily pot smoker, I can even tolerate having a cigarette at the bar without buying any, and I literally tripled my gym workout.

tl;dr Shift around your other vices to make it work, smoke enough weed that you are way too lazy to go outside.""I quit cold turkey about two months ago, been smoking for about 5 years. I'm going strong, celebrated two months without a smoke on January 27, so I'm happy! I just decided one day that it wasn't doing me any good to be smoking, and it just wasn't cool anymore.""Zyban (wellbutrin), sunflower seeds, butterscotch candies, hot tea and 2 years of willpower.""I went into inpatient treatment for alcoholism (one where they didn't allow smoking.) Desperate times, man. "cold turkey and white knuckles. good luck."I had to do it cold turkey, and it's been more than a year and a half now since I've had one.

I had to go out of my way to avoid any scenarios that trigger me wanting to smoke. I don't go around smokers or places, even my own parents, if there's a possibility of being exposed to it, especially in an enclosed area. They have to do it outside, out of sight, out of smell-range or I can't be around it. Yes some find it offensive but you have to take responsibility for your own health. It's sucks sometimes because I feel like an ass but it has helped me tremendously and I won't let anything ruin my progress. 

The worst part is the smell thing. You don't realize it while you're a smoker you, your clothes, your things, all *reek* of smoke (even if you think you don't, you do), so you don't notice it in your vicinity much. When you quit and that tolerance to it wears off, you can smell the slightest hint of it a mile away. 

That in itself has been the biggest motivator for me to stay off of cigarettes. I never realized how bad I smelled and now I can tell how bad others smell. I don't want to be like that again. ""I'm not a smoker, nor do I have any kids, but a friend of mine quit a little over a year ago and I suggested that when the urge started to become overwhelming, he should stop and picture his 7yo daughter lighting one up. He said that actually helped a few times.


Much more so than our other friend who kept trying to stop and I offered to put my dick in his mouth instead."At same time started using J. Crows Iodine could have helped. I had stopped smoking before and never last more then five days had been smoking for almost ten years. Also my father always said don't say quit just say stop because you should never fully quit something you like. He stopped smoking regular when he was around 30 and has had maybe a pack total in 30 years since. I have stopped since October and some days still crave but if you do one healthy thing a day it goes away and takes your mind off it."The easiest way I found to quit was to stop the smoke breaks and stop wanting that social part of smoking. It literally took me changing jobs from a place where I smoked to somewhere no one smoked for it to be consistent.

 I smoked for close to 15 years and quit a hundred times. This was the first time it stuck for more than a year. 
"I didn't quit .. I smoke like a moron... "I just stopped. I found myself enjoying the time away from my desk moreso than the actual smoking, so I still take 'smoke breaks' - I get up, walk around outside for a couple minutes, and come back in. Works great!

Also, my lady absolutely HATED the smell and taste of kissing a smoker so I quit for her.

My mom quit because my 8 year old told her that she was going to die if she kept smoking.""Allen Carr's book ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"".  I was really skeptical, but I couldn't recommend it more highly to anyone who is even remotely interested in quitting.  It's not very expensive (about what a pack of cigarettes costs where i live) and may change your life like it did for me, so you have nothing to lose by reading it.""I used Chantix, But I will say use it with caution..... It caused weird side affects.

Hardest thing for me was figuring out how to relax, I guess i used it (smoking) to relax and didn't realize it.

Been 7 years now. Still have to tell myself, I don't need it...."Spontaneous cold turkey. Also... my motivation was I was told I had bad smokers breath. Do I actually get women now that I don't smoke? No.... :("* Chantix.  

The drug doesn't work for everyone, but I kept smoking for two weeks after I started the medication, then ciggies just started tasting bad.  I kept smoking less and less because I got nothing out of it.  After 20 years of trying to quit, it worked beautifully.  Doesn't work as well for some of my friends, but if you keep taking the drug on schedule, you are going to lose all the joy of smoking, which makes it amazingly easy to not pick up another cig - there's no fun in it.""E-Cigarettes. I loved Logic but Blu is another amazing brand. What it lacks in simulating the EXACT feeling of smoking a cigarette is makes up for in usability. You will probably start off smoking more than normal with E-Cigs because you can use them indoors. The best part though, which is what heavily reduced my smoking was that when I was walking to the car, instead of lighting up a cig and then having to smoke the whole thing, I could just take a few puffs and be satisfied.

Eventually you can move to non-nicotine E-cigs. I personally still love the act of smoking and grab an E-Cig every now and then for a night out of drinking or a gaming marathon.""We'll I know this gets a lot of criticism but I did NLP ( hypnotherapy ), it was one of the 60minute quit smoking sessions. It worked amazingly for me, my cravings changed from nicotine to going to the gym, eating healthy and loving life. I had some custom programming that I would accept better than their generic program. Since quitting at Christmas I have lost 8kg and have not smoked since."got serious about rugby again.  my advice would be cold turkey plus exercise.  you can really feel the difference when you're running."Mine was financial, Once they hit 3 bucks a pack I walked away, the first month or so after that really sucked.  The first week or so I still hung out in smoking areas getting the traces of a second hand effect, but after the first week I didn't feel I needed it anymore.""The only way you will be successful at quitting is if you have an ACTUAL reason, not all the health bullshit they try to shove down your throat.

MY wife asked me to quit smoking the day we got married because she didn't want me to die young, so I said yes and had my last cigarette the day of my wedding. If she hadn't asked me to quit I would still smoke today.

Find a reason to quit.""It sounds ridiculous, but one day I realised ""I'm actually going to die some day"", totally freaked out and decided I wanted to live a long and healthy life. Smoking was no longer an option. ""It's had to stop doing something we enjoy. But it's easy to stop doing something we hate. The key is to make yourself hate smoking. 

Here what I did: Every time I lit a cigarette, I talked non-stop about how gross it was and how much I hated it. It didn't matter wether or not it was true. Whenever I saw someone else smoking, I made a point to say (to myself) how bad their their cigarette smelled. Again, it didn't matter if it was true. 

The funny thing is, eventually is *was* true. One day I realized that although i looked forward to the ""event"" of lighting up, I had really grown to hate smoking, and I definitely hated the way it made me feel. Once I made my mind up that I hated it, everything changed. It was no longer about *giving up something I loved.* It was about *not doing something I hated.* Big difference. 

The social aspect wasn't easy at first, and there were times that I missed the comfort of simply holding a cigarette while talking to people. So, I started blowing bubbles. When everyone else lit a cigarette, I got out my bubbles. It was surprisingly soothing. I got to hold something in my hand, I got the calming effects of a deep inhale and exhale, plus got to watch the bubbles, the same way I was used to watch the smoke. It was everything I loved about smoking, and nothing I hated. Eventually I ran out of bubbles but by that time I was over the hump and I really didn't need them anymore. 

**TL;DR: program yourself to hate smoking and replace your cigarettes with bubbles!**
""I just quit cold turkey after 4 years and the first two weeks were hell, but after that it gets A LOT better. You actually feel so much healthier, so when you can actually feel the difference in your body it will help you not want to smoke. A great support system helped me a lot too, I quit with a group friends so having other people to go through it with you makes it bearable. Stick in there and don't give up, you'll feel so much better about yourself if you set a huge goal like this and achieve it!""I also work in an industry where your 'breaks' are just to run outside, haul a smoke back and get back in to work (restaurant). I get how shitty that is, but I wouldn't call it a trigger.

My advice is never say you're quitting, which sounds ridiculous. It sets yourself up for more of a defeat if you fail (which, lets admit, happens). If you say ""I quit"" and then go back 3 days later, you're just going to feel like shit. Tell yourself you're going to make a conscious effort to smoke less, and smoke less. That way if you slip up and have an extra smoke or two from a stressful day, no biggie, back on the smoking-less horse the next day. A lot of quitting smoking is a LOT of willpower.

I also kept a log in my phone of how many smokes I had in a day, when were the key moments of my day when I would want one (morning coffee, arrive at work, mid-day break, after dinner). I'd pick one of those that I thought i could go without and went without it. Eventually I weaned myself down to as few cigarettes I could get by on without murdering everyone and then switched to nicotine gum.

A little fun fact about nicotine gum though: The instructions suggest you chew a piece for 30 seconds and then park it on your gums for up to half an hour. This, in my mind, is a bit ridiculous. You wouldn't slooooowwly smoke a cigarette for half an hour, giving your body a more regular stream of nicotine. I usually just bit a piece in half, chewed it until the nicotine deprivation rage went away, spat it out and chugged a glass of water.

All the best luck to you, 5 times quitting is better than no times quitting. Keep at it.
"I started dipping. And to quick dipping I swallowed the dip. After years of smoking I switched to an e-cig cold turkey about 6 months ago. I'm almost to the no nicotine fluid and I haven't had a cigarette since. "Stop buying cigarettes

I'm not being flippant or trolling or trying to make a cynical joke. I've smoked since I was a teenager and have quit and relapsed multiple times.

Trust me, just stop buying cigarettes. Don't have them in a house, car, anywhere. Dont accept them from anyone, dont even touch them, dont buy them for someone else, dont go out with your smoker friends when they have one. 

Stop blaming cigarettes for your decision to smoke cigarettes. It is always your decision and you make it every time you light up. If you really don't want to smoke, then just don't. Get into that mindset, it is the only way. 

Dont use gum, pills, acupuncture, prayer, meditation, crystals, or anything else to help you. That makes it less your decision and you give up your power.

Do it cold turkey, Make the decision and stick too it. Accept that it is your decision wholeheartedly, and just stop. 

If you do not have the will power to do it, you won't. ""I took three days off work (well, I called in sick) and spent three days solid with my wife, then girlfriend, to help her stay honest. She had been smoking for something like 20 years at that point.

It was fairly tough for her so I had to keep her busy, but there's only so much you can do. At one point I was laying on the couch reading while she was working on her computer and she turned to me and screamed, ""HOW CAN YOU JUST LAY THERE DOING NOTHING? DO SOMETHING!"" LOL. Marriage protip: You REALLY get to know someone when they are under immense stress.

Anyway, getting over those first three days is what did it...the worst of the cravings had passed and, although the next few weeks were tough (she ALMOST bought a pack of herbal cigarettes once) she quit and has been smoke free for over a decade.""I don't recommend it, but being worked over by paramedics at your job because you think you might be having a heart attack is pretty effective.  As it turned out, I was having a (rather severe) anxiety attack, but having never experienced either before, I had nothing to go on except the sensation of my heart racing and thumping against my ribs so forcefully that the possibility that it might just stop seemed totally plausible at the time.

I stopped years ago when the Southern US was going through about 30+ days of 98-100+ degree days and towns were running out of water.  Like, more than 1 or 2, dozens upon dozens were running out.  Well, I had a rule that I'd not smoke in my house and make it smell like a bar which meant going out on my back deck.

Well, it was 100 degrees on a good day and it was more like 110 (feeling like 117-120) most days.  I just refused to go outside in the extreme heat to inhale hot smoke.  Then it went from that to very cold.  Like, VERY cold.  I refused to go outside and freeze my nuts off.  After that, I had quit for nearly a year so I figured why not just keep the ball rolling.

I used the lozenges (Sp?) for the nicotine fits but I think it was my son tat made it stick. At the time he was almost 2 starting to really get into shit.

Good Luck man!!""I think this varies from person to person based on how addictive your personality is, but what worked for me was cold turkey.  I was a smoker for 10 year and made the decision that it was time to cut that shit out.  It was very difficult for me, but I made the mental decision to stop.  I picked a date, let my friends & fam know, then just did it.  I was the biggest asshole to all my friends for a good month & a half.  Worst mood swings I've ever experienced in my life.  But it's been well worth it.  I'm now 3.5 years a non-smoker.  I think you need get your mind prepared for quitting, know that it is going to suck but that the light on the other side is wonderful & well worth it, and stick to you.  You'll need friends and family to help support you.  If you have friends that still smoke in front of you, don't hang out with them until you are ok being in the presence of cigarette smoke.

TL;DR: Find something to keep yourself occupied and good luck."Snus"I started by switching to e-cigs since I really just wanted to get away from tobacco. Whether or not that helped I'm not sure, but I eventually dropped them as well in order to quit entirely.

Withdrawal for me felt a little like the flu, so I would treat myself as sick and just play games, eat a shit-tonne of take-away, junk food, etc. 

I took a break from hanging around my smoker friends for about a week then would hang around them again normally, drinking and watching movies, but would use an Nicorette inhaler instead of smoking (and sparingly!). 

Eventually the feeling of withdrawal (hot flushed and dizzy) felt like its own kind of rush/high and I started to enjoy not smoking more than smoking. The rest was just fighting the boredom and getting used to doing things without smoking.

There are fact sheets online that are a kind of timeline of how much healthier you are since quitting. 10 mins, an hour, a day, a year, etc. I found that really helpful to look at (I still do).

Good luck!

He went Snowboarding in Whitefish on a cloudy day (ALWAYS go on a clear day). His board caught an edge, threw him off a 5 foot ledge, broke 4 ribs.

I went to the doctor and he prescribed Chantix, back then there wasn't much on the adverse side effects. I was one of the first few hundreds or thousands of people that were asked to report side effects directly to health care officials.  

I took the drug for 2 months, and it worked. I smoked for the first few weeks but after that my desire for smoking really did disappear. Though the side effects made me quit taking Chantix, they were also severe. So technically I never finished the entire course of meds recommended. But it worked and every time I thought I wanted to smoke, instead I used Altoids (mints) to get through the stressful parts of my day.

So, I guess I'm saying that I did it at the same time I was making some pretty meaningful lifestyle changes. Maybe it would help you to take up a new sport or join a new club at the same time? Is there a local indoor rock climbing gym?  Your local hash house harriers chapter? Maybe you can hit the gym or go for a run during your lunch break at work?

Getting a good, hard workout in was helpful for me for two reasons. First, I was able to blow off steam and relieve stress. Second, it punished me if I bummed one while I was out at the bar the night before! I could feel the damage I had done if I backslid.

And those e-cigarettes are junk: it's just more nicotine!""Self-control doesn't have to be about willpower, it can be about structuring your environment so that you don't have to constantly make the choice to ""be good."" I've never quit smoking, but I've quit lots of other bad habits. This approach is pretty flexible.

1) Try to go cold turkey. The aim is not necessarily to quit (though if you do, bonus!), it's to collect data about your triggers for your vice.

2) Write that shit down. Keep a notepad with you. Make a few notes about your mood, location, company, intensity of craving, etc. If you end up having a cigarette, no biggie.

3) At the end of the week (possibly longer for habits less frequent than smoking), try to categorize the data. Separate out actual triggers from ""just because"" moments. At a general level, your top 2-3 triggers will probably account for 75-90% of your habit.

4) The tricky part: figure out how to restructure the trigger environments to discourage or disallow the vice. Usually, it has to be something more powerful than just not having access. Maybe your main triggers all occur at work. Tell your closest work friend that you're trying to quit and give them your cigarettes. You'll still have access, but you'll have to ask your friend and face the fact that you're actively *choosing* to smoke. This is how you start to break the stimulus-response link, by forcing you to make and active choice every time.

5) Remember that it's not about having done well, it's about doing a little bit better next time. Some days are going to be bad, but tomorrow always has the potential to be better.

Best of luck!""I got yet another head cold, when I would've rather dug out my eyeballs with a spoon than smoke a cigarette. That made it easier. After that I made a conscious decision to not smoke anymore. I told myself each time I wanted one to just wait a day, and if I really wanted one I could have one ""tomorrow."" It's been about 4 years now.""Radiation treatments to my abdomen for testicular cancer. Zapped 15 seconds a side, then went home & vomited for hours. Unlike when drunk, I didn't feel better after puking. Killed any nicotine cravings & I've  been clean 11 years. ""I went cold turkey, the 1st january 2014, havent smoked since even though i live with a smoker.""Got the flu, didn't smoke for four days. Decided I didn't have to start smoking again, and just quit. After this it just takes resolve and willpower. Worked for me!""A potential solution - don't have cigs on you and make the deal that you will have to pay anybody 100 dollars if you attempt to bum a cig from them (or a kick in the nuts, whichever motivates you the most).""I stopped when I got serious about exercise and playing sports, trying to catch your breath and hack gray and black phlegm out if your lungs sucks.""You say you have an e-cig, but what level of nicotine are you using? Start off high and wean yourself down to lower concentrations. 

Also, plug for /r/electronic_cigarette great community to help kick the habit""You have to want it, and to want it you have to believe a) just how awful it is for you and b) just how much better off you'll be without. Make a list to the pros (""I like it!"") and cons (""No one has *ever* enjoyed emphysema"") and be honest. The pros list should be embarrassingly short.       
Once you've been convinced (if you aren't already), man/woman the fuck up and just *do* it. Lots of things are hard. Life is hard. But there is nothing so rewarding as facing down a challenge and coming out scarred but victorious. I know, I know: you *want* one, it'll feel so good, you'll be grumpy & gain weight without. Your brain is a cruel motherfucker to be party to that shit, you just need to persevere and get over it. after a few days it isn;t even chemical dependency anymore, it's just (with all due respect) you being a bitch. You're better than a mere *cigarette* right?       
The increased chance of cancer, of having bits of your mouth or throat or lungs carved away, forever from your body, disfiguring you; the unimaginable pain, that breathing is now a hellish experience, a million fires in your chest with every gasp; the loss & pain the people around you will feel when youre gone, asking themselves ""Why couldn't barbiesarthritis just *listen* when I begged him/her to stop"". *That*, my friend, will be real pain & struggle. Just tossing the pack & never looking...er...back? A minor blip. It's not impossibe, just try. Hard. Harder than you've ever tried anything. You really can do it, now, without regret. Chewing gum (NOT nicorette), fidgety hand activities (pen twirling, cards, drawing, whatever), food, any & all distractions are fair game. *Do something else*. ANYthing else. Make a deal, ask someone to hold you to it. Make it reprehensible, something morally vile to you: ""If I every have another smoke, I have to do it while raping an alterboy"" or ""For each cigarette I have from now on, I have to donate $50 to the KKK"". Mean it. Give yourself a real, horrible, right-now consequence and picture yourself having to do this thing. For me it's a promise to ask a relative for a handjob. No one wants that. Whether or not I'd follow through, it weighs on me: ""If I smoke, I have to do this horrible *thing*"".      

Anyway. That's how I quit. I refused to buy myself a new pack, and a day later, while the inside of my head was *SCREAMING* at me, pissed, just horrid, I tapped my feet and relaxed and just refused to go get a new one. I was in a foul mood. But it passed. Everything does. The want will come back, while drinking, while other friends are smoking, just out of the blue. I just have to remember to suck it up. I don't need that shit.       

"Shisha pens :PI broke my foot and was more or less immobile for weeks other than to bathe. Had no choice but to quit. "I tried quitting many times unsuccessfully.

one night, I got hammered. like, high school blackout wasted. woke up with probably one of the worse hangovers I have ever had. thought I wanted a smoke, but I didn't. decided I would try to force myself to smoke. was probably the worst thing I have ever done to myself in my life. it made me feel much worse, puked all day. the thought of smoking made me feel awful.

that was day one. that was 8 years ago."I Haven't had a smoke since Sunday. I just woke up and decided I wanted to smell and taste again. Cold turkey. Besides running and working out I've just been hiding in my house to get through this first week. Will power Mayne."Quit cold turkey. Substitute in marijuana.
Don't use e-cigs/hookahs..they get you more addicted. My friend went from smoking like 10 cigs a day to his e-cig and then he lost it and now smokes a pack a day due to the amount of nicotine the e-cig was giving him.""My friend and I had both had it with smoking around the same time, so we each set a date and drew up contracts that said that if either of us ever smoked again after that day, the other guy had his permission to beat the living shit out of him, within reason. It started off as kind of a drunken joke, but it did the trick. We were both ready to quit anyway, but this was the thing we needed to get over those, ""Meh, why not?""-type cravings.""I read Alan Carr's ""The Only Way To Quit Smoking"" and although it is a bit gimmicky, it did get me prepared to quit.  I was able to quit cold turkey after reading this book.  I had smoked for more than ten years.""This will get buried but I think it's important any way. 

I was able to quit because it was what I wanted. I didn't want to smoke anymore. I didn't want to be a smoker. I found out I was pregnant and I didn't want to be that mother. I wanted to be healthy and set a good example and do everything I could to make sure my baby was healthy. 

I had been smoking fairly heavily for about four years when I quit. I have never regretted it. I do occasionally have cravings still but I know that they're not worth it. Being the person I want to be is worth ignoring the cravings. ""I had success with the e-cigs.  I actually enjoy the e-cigs more to be honest as I actually get a buzz from them.
"I don't know exactly how I quit I just sort of stopped smoking cigarettes. I can't pin point a date I quit. I went from a pack every 2 days my senior year of college to not buying packs anymore and bumming to I don't smoke anymore over the course of a year and half."I started smoking around 14-15. By 17 i was smoking a pack a day. I did that until i turned 30, which is when i decided i would quit smoking. Turns out i had one cigarette after that in a moment of weakness. No biggie. My problem is that i decided i could smoke cigars when drinking. I started inhaling just a little smoke. Cut to a couple years later and i'm smoking cigars everyday and inhaling more than just a little. Fuck me i'm now 35ish and still addicted to nicotine. Then one drunken night i want to smoke a cigar but the combination of the crappy swisher sweet smoke along with drunkenness causes me to hiccup every time i try to take a drag. I'm so addicted that i'm trying to fight through my bodies' natural revulsion to the poison just so i can satiate that urge. 

It didn't dawn on my right away that i had quit. I just knew i hated that feeling of wanting/needing nicotine and not being able to get my fix. So that's how i quit. I didn't plan it. Even after i quit i didn't know i had quit. I just had a depressing humbling moment brought on by addiction that was so distasteful to me that i haven't gone back. 14 months nicotine free. "My bank card card got compromised which led to me being able to spend far less. If I wanted to smoke I'd have to go all the way to the bank and withdraw cash. Fuck that. Three days later I'm a non smoker. "Never quit with another addiction, candy, soda,.etc. Never be without water. Like most substances it's water soluble, meaning it bonds well with water. The more water cycles through the lower the substance concentration. Every tick answered with a swig and it'll feel like an awakening.""Get a **good** electronic cig. I smoked a pack a day, then a shop specializing in e-cigs opened less than a mile from my house. I went in a got a little $50 kit. While it did reduce my cigs/day, I still didn't get that ""hit"" like a real cig. Then I got an opportunity to get a $200 unit at a deal, and I switched to a very nice e-cig (Joyetech eVic) and the difference was like the difference in smoking Pyramids vs. Marlboros. I have since switched again to a mechanical mod (Smok Magneto) with a Russian 91% tank, and it's even better. I have completely quit regular cigs, and have gone from 18mg nicotine down to 6mg nicotine in my juice.""Chantix. It took me three attempts because the first two times I didn't really want to and was being forced by my dad (said he'd pay for my schooling if I quit). 

My third go at it was this August and it's because I really wanted to stop. I am just turned 29, I was beginning to see signs of aging, it's not cool anymore, all my friends quit, it's expensive, and I was so fucking *tired* of it *controlling* my life and thoughts. Every day was ""Do I have enough for the night, or should I stop at the mart on the way home/to work/before going to x event"". It's goddamned exhausting. 

Now, I am free and it's amazing. Six months in February. Never again. ""Cold turkey worked for me as well.  
However, for about 3 months to a year after you have to watch out for that moment of weakness.

I had one when I had just quit for 3 months and I was drinking with a friend I've not seen for a long time.  He lit up a cigarette and I was very drunk and reached for the box.  My other close friend who knew that I had quit called me a pussy and made me have second thoughts about lighting it.  I credit him to this day for helping me quit for life.
It's been almost 10 years since, I recently lit one while I was drunk and I felt dizzy and nauseous so I'm done with it. ""I pray it is not too late to see this. I swear by Allen Carr's EasyWay to quit smoking. Despite what you think quitting smoking really doesn't have to be a negative experience, you don't have to miss it, it's about getting you're head around the fact you aren't actually giving anything up. This book changed my life and yes, I was insanely skeptical to begin with. How could a book get me to quit when drugs failed? Please OP give this a try, PM me with your address and I will send you my copy. THIS SHIT WORKS.""Personally, I was able to quit along with the help of an Oregon medical marijuana card, some really good cannabis, and a water pipe that was taller than I was.

  How I was able to *stay* quit was by never, ever smoking another cigarette. It sounds silly to say, but when you've quit for six months or a year, and you're tipsy at a party and folks are smoking, you really feel like you could smoke *just one* cigarette. You can't. You cannot smoke that one cigarette. I quit smoking for a year at a time FOUR times, and relapsed because I smoked a cigarette ""just this once."" Now I've gone a little over three years with no tobacco at all. And I feel great. I don't get sick nearly as often as I used to, and running and biking isn't exhausting. But I've wanted a cigarette every day for three years. They smell gross to me, but I still want them and I just don't let myself.""Tried for several yrs to quit. The last time, I thought about it for weeks and finally one Sunday nite I was sitting on my bed about to turn in. As I stubbed out my cig I said ""That's it, I'm done.""

I went to sleep and when I woke up I had no craving for a smoke and never have since. Don't know if it was self-hypnosis or what, I just never wanted one again. It's been many, many years.

For 15 yrs or so I would sometimes dream I started up again and be very disappointed in myself till I woke up.""I happened to have a very easy time quitting. Smoked about 4 or 5 a day in the worst of it. One week I had the flu pretty bad, and when it was starting to go away I went out one night and ended up getting pretty drunk. The next day, I felt hungover as fuck but decided I really wanted a cigarette anyway so I thought, fuck it I'll have one. So I went outside and started smoking the cigarette and it immediately felt awful and disgusting but for some reason I toughed it out until about halfway through. Finally I thought, this is disgusting, why the hell am I even doing this? So I tossed the one I had and threw the rest in the trash. That memory of that disgusting cigarette made it really easy to quit, for me - haven't wanted one since then. Sorry that's not really advice - I guess you could just get sick, then drunk, then smoke one and see how it feels. 

Sidenote: I found out recently that [Paul McCartney had a similar experience quitting](http://youtu.be/jcYq3vtkITU?t=23m49s) - so I guess it's been effective for at least two people."/r/stopsmoking and cold turkey"I quit using e-cigs a week after my grandpa died from COPD/complications from pneumonia. He smoked for over fifty years, and in his last moments, he kept struggling to open his eyes like he didn't accept dying. My grandpa was basically a second father to me, and watching someone you love get ripped from the Earth was enough to make me seriously rethink everything in my life. It's a shame that it had to be something that drastic to make me make what seems like a straightforward decision.

Basically just don't think about yourself and think about what it'll do to your family. When I started to think about my grandpa and my dad (who smokes himself and is starting to develop breathing problems himself), it made smoking seem worthless. That's what helped me, at least, I wish you the best of luck, man.""Also, I just noticed that you're in health care. Me too! Do what I did and get a job at your local cancer hospital, if you have one. After seeing about 50 people with stomas in your first week, smoking will start to lose its luster.""I quit when I was 18. Started back up a year and a half later, but it worked.

I went to basic training (no tobacco permitted).""I quit 19 years ago this past New years eve after MANY attempts to do so. I had bronchitis and could barely breathe but was attempting to smoke anyway, I stepped outside myself for a moment and took a long unbiased look at my behavior. Why was I going to pay big bucks to kill myself? I had also just found out I was going to be a first time father and knew that I was only a smoker because both parents were. My children (all three are militant non smokers). Do it for the right reason and it is easy.""Actually I just got really sick. Came down with a nasty sinus infection and felt so miserable I couldn't smoke. 

Once that cleared up I was done. No more desire at all. Hit one year on January 4th. 

Keep trying op. You'll get it. "I became disgusted in myself and how bad I smelled and quit cold turkey.  "Persistence. Never give up quitting, though it does get old, you will eventually make it. ""The patch.  And Love.   I told myself that i want to love my partner for the rest of my life, and I need to do whatever I can do spend more time alive.   So that really helped me.

So of course two years later, we're broken up.  But even still, I would quit again now for the thought of love.  That my next love will get more of me. 

Its been over 2 years, and my mouth still sometimes waters thinking about the FEELINg of it, but the smell makes me sick.  ""Zyban worked amazing for me! I was supposed to take it for 2 months but only needed the first 2 weeks, I didn't even finish my full prescription cause I don't like pills. It gives you that start that you need then willpower carries you the rest of the way, if you're ready""Cold turkey worked for me. I had worked up to 2 packs a day over 10 years. One day I just told myself I would never smoke another cigarette. The third day was the hardest. I went out to lunch with my husband and I got so angry for no reason. We went home and I was just sobbing on the couch. I got up and went for a long run - I had been a smokerrunner for a few years before this. I came back and still felt miserable without my cigarette but it seemed tolerable after the run.

By the 5th day my husband realized I was really going through with it and I'd be able to quit. He didn't want to be left behind still smoking when I had quit. He went out and bought patches and quit completely within a month.

There, two methods of quitting that worked. Just tell yourself you'll never smoke another cigarette again.""I made quitting smoking into a drinking game. Since drinking is one of the most (and one of my most) common smoking triggers, I tested myself while out with friends (some who smoke) to see how many beers I could drink before I needed a cigarette. Eventually, I didn't need one, and not smoking in other situations became that much easier. ""I used to do dipping tobacco on and off, and smoked regularly for quite a while. However I did not smoke 10+ years like some people. At one point I stopped smoking and started using dipping tobacco again. After a while, I could not stomach dipping anymore. From the taste to the grit, I got sick of it all. So I quit dipping cold turkey and don't use tobacco anymore. I will have a cigar once in a blue moon and I do miss having a nice pipe smoke, but those were more once-in-a-while activities than everyday habits.""I'm kind of late to this, but maybe you'll end up seeing this so what the heck. While I haven't smoked myself, growing up my dad would go through at minimum a pack a day. He's been cigarette clean going on 8 years now.

One year we were going on a family vacation to Europe and it was after they changed the rules so you couldn't smoke on a plane. So he decided to quite a few months ahead of the trip because he didn't think he'd be able to handle a 6-7 hour trip without having a smoke.

He used the gum and that seemed to work for him. But as others said, having a big motivation was also probably a major factor.""Every time I had a craving, I would think about how much better my throat would feel the following morning if I held off.  And the following morning, I would remember to be conscious of how much better my throat actually felt.  This repeated short-term reward loop worked.  I eventually started noticing how much better my fingers and clothes smelled without the reek of tobacco smoke.""A trip to the ER with chest pains. Fear is the great motivator.

After that, a course of the patch, and when it looked like that wouldn't work, a course of prescription inhalers. Clean for four years now.""Cold turkey is the only way to go. Everything else finds a replacement for the cigarette, so if you are without your replacement you will find the real thing.
My trick was this. I kept an open pack of smokes with me at all times during my quitting process which was a few weeks. I would just tell myself if I had a craving for a cigarette that I could have one later. When later would happen I'd tell myself the same thing again. We've all put off that next cigarette. In this case just keep putting it off. With the cigarettes on you, you know you're in control at all times. ""Good Luck...I stopped smoking 10 years ago. I did this by allowing myself only one cigarette on an evening before bed for about 2-3 weeks. This gave me something to look forward to if I fancied a smoke but also reduced my nicotine addition.  If your trigger is work then don't tell work your stopping so you can still have the break but use the time to reflect and praise yourself on how strong your being.  You can do it!!
""Chantix, for me. Stopped in November 2008.""Hasten to add, started at 14 (yeah, I know), stopped at 38. Tried 2 or 3 times to go cold turkey, and failed. Tried the Allen Carr method, that worked for a few months till I deliberately started again to piss off an ex-gf (yeah, I know).

Started Chantix while on a 2-pack-a-day habit. The Chantix gave me wicked flatulence and wacky, vivid dreams. Took it for 7-9 weeks after I last smoked, stopped when I felt I'd be okay. The nasty side-effects became public a while after I'd stopped taking it. 

I'm now one of those asshole ex-smokers who hates the smell of cigarette smoke.

/edit: typo""Cold Turkey.  Here's a few things that helped.

The first few weeks might be hard.  I removed all traces from the house--ashtray outside, lighters, etc.  I didn't drink alcohol.  I did eat whatever the Hell I wanted, and I'm typically pretty conscientious about that type of thing.  I kept in mind that I might be moody/tried to nip that type of thinking/attitude in the bud.  And I avoided people I used to smoke with for a time.  Good luck!""What worked for me was smoking so much and for so long that I just stopped liking it.

I smoked for 20 years and I quit cold turkey after quitting many times in the past.. I've quit like 15 times or so, all cold turkey. Sometimes I started again after a few days, weeks or months and once I started smoking again after a year. I always got back to the habit because I loved smoking. I was quitting because I knew it was bad for me but deep down I really enjoyed it so whenever I had an excuse I would go back.

Finally after 20 years one day I realized I had stopped enjoying my cigarettes as much and started feeling repulsed by the taste they left in my mouth every morning and how sick they made me feel every night I went out drinking. I smoked compulsively when I drank, I could smoke 4 packs in a night. I noticed that the cigarettes had a bigger effect on my hangovers than the whisky, beer, wine and champagne I combined the night before. So I quit again and this time I know I'm never going back.

I haven't puffed a single time for over a year now and I don't like smoking anymore but I still have cravings.. as time goes by the cravings get spaced out more and become weaker but every once in a while they remind me they are still there and maybe will be there forever. My father told me once a long time ago that he still had it occasionally 30 years after he quit so I expect it will be the same for me and it doesn't bother me much anymore... I got used to it.""I smoked for about 20 years and what finally got me to stop was when my daughter asked me to quit.  What I did was go out an get me one of those e-cigs, I used it in place of the real thing.  I left it at work one Friday and said to hell with it and never looked back.  That was a year ago.  It took about a month of use before I got to that point."Hypnosis. Gave me that extra willpower."not a smoker but I can tell you how my dad got over the smoking habit. he, too, failed the first few tries. he had used the patch, and he stopped hanging around with his buddies when they stepped out for a smoke break. each time he tried something new, he would easily revert back because of some extraneous circumstance - or so he says. he would blame stress, pressure, seeing other people smoke. 

BUT the one thing that finally gave him the angst to kick the habit for good was... having my little sister born. after reading articles on the affects of second hand smoking in conjunction with the effective commercials depicting holes in people's throats and windpipes after lung surgery - he threw it all away overnight. 

so OP.. what i'm saying is.. HAVE A CHILD. jk. find the right internal motivation for really getting over it. read some of the late medical articles. think about how long you want to live, or if you want kids some day. 

best of luck!"Not me but my dad. He had smoked for quite a while and he smoked somewhere around a pack a day.  One night he was in his bedroom in his 2nd floor apartment. His roommate fell asleep on the couch with a lit cigarette.  It started a fire and his friend died. My dad had to jump off the balcony to escape the fire. From that point on he was done smoking."Quit twice. First time I isolated myself in a cabin in the woods, second time I just got an e- cig. Now I'm an e-cig addict, but I have my wind back and no more coughing. ""Just pretend to smoke your e-cig and do not refill it. Quitting cold turkey will be hard but rewarding in the long run. Between the oral-fixation and nicotine addiction, find ways to keep your hands and mouth occupied besides eating. 

That's bogus that you cannot take a 5 minute break and smokers can. If HR has anything to say about it or wants to write you up, speak with the EEOC about their discrimination towards you as a non-smoker. Now, if you are taking 5 minutes breaks every 30 hour to ""smoke"", co-workers and HR might get pissy. Just use good judgement. 

[Vaping](http://www.livescience.com/41392-e-cigarettes-addicting-safer.html) can still hurt your lungs. My mother developed Hypoxia and COPD/emphysema from smoking after 37 years. I found out she was hiding an e-cig from me after explicitly explaining that if she doesn't stop smoking, she will die. Her lung capacity is now at 19%. It's sad to see her not being able to do much, hooked up to oxygen 24/7, and being sick constantly. My family and I really hope she will become a recipient for a lung transplant, so she can at least enjoy the last years of her life. Even then, I don't know how long she'll live afterwards. Losing your parent to something that could have been halted early on is horrifying. Constant pleas throughout my childhood and adulthood to get her to stop smoking only happened when she collapsed at work last year. 

Quit and find the willpower to get through the withdrawals safely. Patches and therapy do help to some extent to lessen the blow from withdrawals but be ready for some weird feelings of anger, pain, nausea, shakes/tremors, and depression. If you do not have the drive to quit, ask for professional and seek out family/friend help. Insurance plans sometimes have cessation workshops, discounted/free cessation tools, and plans. I wish you luck. Feel free to PM me if you want more information or just want to talk. :)"Cold Turkey. Plus the heart attack and flat lining twice. I can take a hint."Cold turkey, but it probably wouldn't have happened if I hadn't almost died suffocating on a peanut.

It happened on the evening before my birthday in 2008. I had to spend a night at the hospital because of a resulting pharyngeal edema, but that was quite about it. I forgot about the whole story, and then around a month later, out of the blue, I was short of air and figured out I was about to die.

It was horrible, it lasted for quite some time, and I was convinced my lungs are ""shutting down"". It wasn't until a couple of hours later that I figured out it might be psychosomatic as I was still alive; and it wasn't until a couple of visits to doctors' offices that I became convinced about it: I was experiencing panic attacks. A psychologist friend of mine told me that it was probably my mind's reaction to the suffocating episode.

Not that all this awareness helps the issue. It's bad. It's horrible, a full blown panic attack is completely debilitating.

The rest of the story is relatively unimportant, it took me years to shake it off, but the thought of smoking cigarerettes was incompatible with this whole ordeal in my mind from the very first minute. I can't do that to my lung, so I essentially became a non-smoker overnight.

That's not to say I didn't have any physical craving, but now I know that those cease after 2 days. Everything else is in your mind.

The change was so drastic, that after a week I started actually perceiving what cigarette smoke actually smells like, something I hadn't felt for the 14 years of smoking before, and I found it so repulsive that I had to leave smoky establishments every 15 minutes to get some fresh air.

Clean since October 2008, trying to avoid smoky places, which is unfortunately very difficult in Germany.""My dad died from smoking-related illness. I quit cold turkey. Lots of chewing gum helped. Sleep, too."Chantix was a godsend. Plus the dreams fucking ruled.  6.5 years smoke free after almost 20 years of smoking"Smoked a pack a day for 17 years. Did it cold turkey a year and 10 days ago. What helped me is understanding what is happening to your body as you go through the process. For example, keep a little bottle of juice to keep your blood sugar up when you get a craving. 

[This guy](http://whyquit.com/)'s advice helped. ""Don't lock yourself up... Everything you do as a smoker you can do as a non-smoker... Many people before you have shown that it is possible..."" Etc. I watched that video every day for the first four days for support.


""I had been wanting to quit smoking for a long, long time. I hated the taste, the smell, the shame of buying another pack. I constantly reminded myself of how embarrassed I was about smoking. I would force myself to look at other smokers and notice yellow teeth, wrinkled skin, that clinging ashtray smell, the yellowed fingernails, the receding gums. I was scared to quit because I was scared I'd fail again, but more so scared that I would actually succeed. I'd smoked since college, coming to depend on smoking both socially and as stress relief. Twelve years later, I was working in the restaurant business and knew that I couldn't just continue to float along with the subculture norm of my career: hectic, stressful hours and the chemically-based responses to them.

So I didn't quit. I told myself that I wasn't quitting, that I was just putting off buying a new pack. I informed all of my coworkers that I wasn't smoking at work anymore. I explained to friends that I wasn't stepping out for a smoke during happy hour. It sounds silly, but it worked for me. I was able to ""put off"" smoking so much easier than ""quitting."" It was easier to control cravings, easier to see the upside of not smoking since I was experiencing it. After the first week, my routines were reestablished without cigarettes and it was less a glaring loss. It was easier to fight cravings because I knew that five minutes later, it would pass.

I haven't smoked since September 21, 2012. "I finally quit when my son was born.  I was out with a friend and smoked.  First of all it suddenly tasted awful to me.  Then when I got home I didn't want to hold my infant son while my hands smelled like smoke.  That was over 5 years ago.  I haven't smoked since and have had zero desire to."I did a ten day Vipassana retreat on which tobacco products aren't allowed.

Kicked my habit, cold turkey, in there."I decided that it was time for me to quit smoking.  Nothing will work if you aren't ready to quit."Feeling Ill and tired all the time and not wanting to smoke anymore.

Smoked for 17 years. Quit cold turkey. You REALLY have to want to stop."Fuck. All this talk about quitting makes me really want a cigarette.It makes me happy I'm not controlled by tobacco anymore. "I plan on quitting cold turkey on my dads birthday, March 30th. I got excited to see this thread, but I hope these next two months arn't too quick. You got this dude, nothing compares to inner will power, make a promise to yourself and own it. I'll be right there with you soon enough."Cold Turkey coupled with an app that tells me how much money I'm saving by not smoking. It's a good bit of money.ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES!!!!!!!!!Being unemployed didn't hurt"Hate, I hated those damn cigarettes. I started smoking when I was 14 and I just couldnt stop. First time I tried I was 21 but when your brothers and Dad smoked it was just difficult to quit, I lasted a month. 

Then 10 years later I woke up from a heavy night of drinking and coughed up blood I knew that it was time to stop. 

I started with E-cigs for about 2 months which kind of helped since im not really taking tobacco in. Then I went to Vegas and stupidly left my E-cig in my pocket when I went to the pool, fucker got wet. I could not find a replacement anywhere. Then I asked for my brother for a real cigarette I puffed on it and it was fucking VILE. I threw that shit away.

After that I haven't smoked in 2 years.

Now my Dad is trying to quit and my Mom keeps asking me for advice and I tell her that the only way he will quit is if he wants too. If he doesn't he wont.""The reasons people smoke is complex. So there is no (one size fits all) solution.

What I did was face why I smoked..then optimized how I got my nicotine..

Smoking -> SNUS -> E-CIG  did that for about a year.. then dropped the nicotine and *poof* off nicotine forever!
""My dad was a smoker for 30+ years. He got his gallbladder taken out for something unrelated to smoking. After the surgery he said, ""I feel so shitty I can't even smoke."" So he stopped smoking. It's been about five years now since he's had a cigarette. 

I think the best way to quit is cold turkey. You just have to have the willpower and you can do it."What kind of e-cig do you have? How often and why do you still smoke real cigs when you have your e-cig? Having the right one for your needs makes all the difference."My Dad used hypnosis back in the late 80s. He had tried cold turkey and the available gums and such at the time without any luck. It wasn't hypnosis like the cartoons where he magically didn't want to smoke anymore. He said that it helped him get past the cravings, but he still felt the urge to smoke because of old habit. ""I put out a cigarette one New Years eve and realised I hadn't enjoyed smoking it, so I didn't smoke anymore. That was 3 years ago.""I was on the nicotine patch (14 mg if I recall correctly). It wasn't working. I would tear the patch off and light up.  While on the patch, I hurt my back and had to see a doctor. We prescribed me Wellbutrin for my muscle pain. The Wellbutrin along with the 14mg patch eliminated my cravings within a day or two and I haven't smoked since. ""Ecig. I've decreased my nicotine from 12mg to 6mg. My vape tastes like the first bite of a waffle that has vanilla and maple syrup on it. My office and room smell like I've been eating waffles. It's really the best. And to those who said I haven't quit, fuck off. That's like saying people chewing the gum haven't quit or people on the patch haven't quit. I haven't been combusting analogs so that's quitting in my eyes."I signed up to run the NYC marathon and by the time I had reached the 16 mile run part of my training I just looked at my last cig and said WTF am I doing.  Cold turkey is the way to go"E cig all the way. Started w 36 mg nicotine juice, currently down to 18mg, have tried real cigarettes since but the taste and smell makes me feel sick now. The 36mg e juice was the only thing I'd tried that satisfied a nicotine craving at the time ""My friends took me to their house for 4 days. I had zero access to cigarettes, no bank cards, no cash, etc.... 
Four smokeless days later, I had zero desire to start up again. That was July 13, 1999. ""Patches for 2 weeks to stop the physical habit of having a smoke with coffee/tea or after food. Then just pure will power.

I failed maybe 3 - 5 times before I got over them.

My advice, go for it, if you fail do not give up, try and try again.

You will have cravings for 6 - 12 months after and it wont be easy but you can do it.

DO NOT HAVE A PACK IN THE CUPBOARD JUST IN CASE.

Also: I found it helped to rip my last full pack up and throw them in the bin, after I smoked one out of the pack.

Get active, your body is goingto tell you that you are hungry but it is nicotine craving, Drink ALOT of water. Do not care if you put on a few kilos, just go for a walk or do something when you want a smoke. I did situps and pushups when I wanted a smoke.

It is hard, but you can do it.""I just quit. thats it simple. And if I had one, then I quit again. And when I had one, i quit again. Soon the intervals became weeks and months, now its been 7 years.

To me the biggest things are

1) don't get down on yourself if you backslide. Just throw out the rest of the pack and go again.

2) if you MUST have 1, have 1.

3) Keep quitting

good luck""Promised my new gf at the time I'd quit. Bi didn't of course, but I did cut way back.  Eventually I just found myself not smoking.  So I guess it was gradual weaning combined with a really great woman."E Cigarettes are the only thing that ever helped me.  "First and foremost you must make the decision for your self that you want to quit, not quitting for someone or something else it has to be your decision. Then patches worked for me!"/r/stopsmoking could help too. Motivates you loads."e-cigs. I still vape very low nicotine juices, because frankly I love it. But I haven't burned tobacco leaf in over two years. My lungs have never felt better. Check out /r/electronic_cigarette. ""By the words of great Eminem, ""You can do anything you set your mind to, man"".

Seriously though, you can. I smoked for 6 years straight. Last year, I joined a gym and when exercising I noticed that I'd get tired easily. I started imagining my future. All sick and weak, possibly with cancer. A burden to myself and all others around me. The very next day, I quit. No gum, no 3-cigs, no nothing. I thought about it and took action. And haven't looked back since then. :)""**HABIT CHANGES.** When I decided I wanted to quit, I changed a lot of the habits that were my ""smoking triggers."" I didn't drink coffee or alcohol for a month or two, when I needed some air I would go out a different part of the building than when I would go out for a cigarette, etc. Eliminating smoking cues and triggers helped me immensely.  ""A Heart Attack, a wife (And mother of our 4 kids) threatening to kill me if she ever saw me with another cigarette and Chantix.

But seriously, If one method does not work, try another. Not everything works for everyone, but there is bound to be something out there than can help you out, given enough willpower.""First I stopped trigger smoking, so the wake up smoke the after food smoke the driving smoke I cut all those out, I did not schedule smokes but I waited until I had a craving. separating the habbit from the cravings was the first step. I also stopped thinking of myself as a smoker. it is weird how that activity had become part of my identity. I was the smoking friend in my group of friends. some serious thought about who I was other than a smoker make ignoring the habit smokes easier. it was not me any more.

second I started to think of smoking as gross. basically some self imposed aversion therapy. 

lastly I tried cold turkey a few times but eventually ended up on wellbutrin. because I had already broke the habit and was smoking on cravings only wellbutrin cutting the cravings made quitting a snap. after a week on wellbutrin I was smoke free and by the end of the month I was off wellbutrin and not smoking. it was very strange to see someone go smoke and not want to go with them. suddenly smokers were very odd to me. getting up and going outside in the middle of fun with friends.

I would like to note that I tried cold turkey many times and failed. I also tried patches and gums and failed. I even tried e-cigs and ended up sucking on those more than I smoked. Nicotine is hard to quit. 90% of the battle is mental. get the triggers and self identity out of the way and the rest is much easier.
**ALSO** if you do not want to quit. do not try. really ask yourself if you want to quit. every smoker says they want to quit because society guilt and shames you into saying that. unless you want to quit you will fail. there is some serious emotional/mental work that you have to do separating the cravings from what you really want. once you sort all of that out you will be able to move forward.


Good Luck!""I met a guy. He never asked me to quit or said anything to me, but I knew he didn't really like it. I woke up one morning and decided that was it. I threw my cigarettes away and haven't touched one since. That was 3.5 years ago! ""A combination of Allen Carr's book along with 8 weeks of Chantix worked for me after more than 25 years of smoking. After about 3 weeks or so on Chantix, I wasn't getting any satisfaction from smoking. After smoking a cigarette, I felt the same as I did when I went out to smoke. The book really helped me understand nicotine addiction as well. 35 days for me. I made my mind up not to smoke another cigarette, no matter how bad I think I want one. Making your mind up and sticking to it is a large part of it. ""I quit cold turkey a little over 2 years ago, after a 4 week bout with bronchitis/pneumonia. Smoked during the sickness, even though I could barely breath, was insane coughing, and it hurt to take a shallow breath, I would still smoke. Good thing I had the sickness to force me to stop. Then when I was back in good health, I realized I it was time for my relationship with cigarettes to come to an end. So haven't touched one since. Won't even take a drag when drunk...cuz that'll start the whole cycle again."cold turkey the day my son was born"I haven't had a cigarette in a month and did it cold turkey.  I guess it also helped that I was kinda sick before hand, which made me not want to smoke. ""Tried to quit cold turkey lots of times and it never worked. Your brain starts playing tricks on you trying to convince you that you don't actually want to quit and your reasons for wanting to quit aren't valid. You like smoking, why stop something you like? Everything is bad for you, you might as well enjoy things while you can. It really fucks with your mind.

I ended up getting patches and they were miraculous. My other big issue was that the physical withdrawal would make me so irritable I couldn't even be around anyone. Patches solved that right away.""I'm 24, been smoking since I was 19. I've recently been spending a lot more time at home to deflate from a very stressful last few years. I noticed that it's been very easy to quit because I'm not around different people constantly going to have a cigarette. A lot of times I wouldn't even smoke because I wanted a cigarette, I was just in a moment of boredom and going to smoke a cigarette was something to do. I've never smoked more than half a pack a day (on average) so it's probably easier for me than someone who smokes a pack or two a day. I feel like I would die instantly if I ever smoked that much.""Champix helped me get past the initial month, then I went without any meds.

It really does work.  By the time I quit, Champix had made smoking absolutely disgusting.  I could barely get through a whole one anymore."Honestly I was so sick of the cold so I bought this e-cig not sure what it's called (it's a different kind of e-cig with refillable cartridges using a liquid) I was at about a pack a day. I still got the craving for a cig but I'd just ignore it and a week later the cravings stopped.  It's much more cost effective than cigs!Have you tried hi fiving your cat?"i was about a pack a day smoker 6 years ago. My wife & i were trying to get pregnant when it happened i promised to stop smoking. About a month before we finally did get pregnant i came down the most horible stomach sickness i have ever had i couldnt even keep down water for almost two weeks almost ended up in the hospital very very painful. I was in so much pain & agony i honestly never even thought about a cigarette, after i got better i have never touched caffine (another bad habbit of mine at the time) or cigaretts. Like i said its been 6 years.""I quit for two reasons:

1. Man partner is asthmatic and I didn't want to be responsible for causing him breathing problems.

2. I was unemployed and had a moment of reflection after I borrow $20 from my mother to buy a pack of cigarettes.

I had a few slip ups on the way. For some reason I thought smoking in the shower with the fan on would cover the smell. Don't do this, your ceiling turns yellow. But I've been smoke free for nearly 9 years and it feels great! I still get the odd craving a few times a year (normally after dreaming about smoking) though which is strange.""My insurance company said, that they will charge me an extra $40 a month for every smoking member in my family.
I quit as soon as that policy kicked in. I just didn't smoke anymore. It was that easy. The first week was rough, but no issue after that anymore. I have been smoke free for over two years.""The cold hard truth is that you have to have the willpower to quit. Most smokers who ""want"" to quit, don't really ""want"" to. If you absolutely want to quit, you can and will.

Don't get me wrong, I was a smoker for 7 years, and it was very difficult to quit, and took multiple attempts.

What eventually worked for me was quitting cold turkey on Friday, then hitting the gym HARD doing LOTS and LOTS of CARDIO. Why cardio? Because cardio helps evaporate the toxins in your body faster. The first week is crucial. You have to get as much shit out of your body before you start craving cigarettes like a mother fucker.

Quitting TIPS:

Don't eat big meals. You'll just want a cigarette.

Cut all friends that smoke out of your life, they don't give two shits whether you quit or not. You'll notice their always the first ones to hand you a cigarette, and peer pressure you back in to smoking again. Tell them to fuck off. If they care about you they will understand and respect you.

Stop drinking alcohol - for obvious reasons.

If you are really hard core, you'll stop having sex for a while too. Ask any real smoker: Big meals, Alcohol, and sex give you the biggest cigarette cravings.

You want to quit, you have to be serious about quitting. Remember, quitting means you'll be gaining part of your life back. You will no longer be controlled by cigarettes, and you'll realize how stupid it was to let your life be controlled by such a thing. Good luck!""Going out of town without cigarettes. 

They're not just a physical habit, they're a psychological one. And the best way to break a habit is to take yourself outside of your normal living situation and into a completely different one, because then a *lot* of your habits are thrown off. 

I went to a convention across the country, slept in a different bed, ate food at restaurants I'd never been to, and partied all weekend with people I didn't know. I didn't eat any meals at the same times I usually did, and there were no 'reminders' of my normal life, so it was actually pretty easy to go cold turkey. 

I was out of town for 4 days and when I got back the craving was still there, but the psychological *need* was gone, and that made it manageable.

Plan a trip somewhere. It doesn't need to be expensive or exotic. Just get away from your normal routine, and don't take cigarettes with you. Make sure there are plenty of activities to keep you occupied, and grit your teeth and power through.""Quit drinking. Seriously. You have to. Eventually I got so sick of cigarettes that I would not smoke unless I had had more than two drinks. First drink, fine. Still don't want to smoke. Second drink, ok. I'm good. Still don't want to smoke. Second drink is gone, I start thinking about it, looking around to see if people are smoking. Take one sip of third drink, ""Alright, who's got cigarettes? Can I get one o' them?"" I probably needed to stop drinking that much anyways, so I took a few years off. Now I can drink a couple of beers and not need to smoke. Smoked for 15 years. Chances are, if you have this kind of association with booze and smokes, you won't be able to drink without wanting to smoke. And you're drunk, so your decision making is poor and you end up smoking. If you put down the drink for at least a few months, you should be good. It's probably proportional to how long you smoked for. I would say at least a month or two for every year you were a smoker. At least. Sounds like you want to quit, so my advice is to lay off the booze for awhile. Eventually, you can probably return to drinking, as long as you are careful. ""I smoked for about seven years (15yo to 22yo). Once I realized how shitty they were making me feel (sort of was having an allergic-like reaction), I just quit.

Also it helps to first switch to actual tobacco rolling your own and this will get you off the mystery addiction toxins that phillip morris has designed for mind control or who knows what.  

The most important change after quitting?  Having my uninterrrupted time back.  "will power"Its simple ... you have to decide to stop. 

Everyone is different. For my wife and I, it was deciding to stop to prepare to get pregnant, and my solidarity with her in doing so. 

But my own sense is you have a justification in your head for smoking ... and that is your job stresses you out, and your only way to take a break is to smoke ... thats a self fulfilling prophecy; you can't quit because you need breaks because your job stresses you out, and the only way to get a break is to take a smoke break ... 

Go deeper; why would anyone smoke if they're in healthcare? second hand, and deeper studies on 'third hand' smoke (residue on fingers, clothes, etc) should prevent smoking altogether in a health care environment. But if you 'need' a break, then work on eliminating why you need the break so that you remove that justification from your mind. 

We went cold turkey. After years of getting sick, already knowing that smoking is bad, even though I love it, smoking just gets stupid. The decision that its bad and stupid to do is a mindset that for us just clicked. One day, its ok to smoke, the next, nope ... done. 

Once in awhile as recreation, maybe 2-3 times a year, I'll have a smoke (vegas or with a client or something), and I feel like complete shit physically the next morning ... its worse than a hangover truthfully because i feel it every time I breathe, and in my throat ... and the residual smell is just disgusting. I kick myself every time because like I said, I really enjoy smoking, but everything that comes with it (on top of death) is simply not worth it. 

You can infinitely justify why you need it, why you need to be around it, whatever. But if you don't actually buy in, quitting won't work for you.

Ask yourself if you really, really are ready to quit, and if you are, then simply be done. You'll be grumpy for about a week or so ... then trying going for a walk, or up some stairs, a jog or run, and see how you feel. The difference will be unbelievable.

The wheezing, the stinky car and home. 4 years ago I decided something had to change. My breathing was becoming very labored and I simply started using the dip more frequently. I substituted the dip for the cigarettes for the next 3 years. My lip was starting to turn raw and my dentist said( precancerous growths) so... I started cutting back and using nicotine gum in addition to dip. Finally about 7 months ago I quit the dip and the nicotine gum, and just started chewing regular gum.

I was gonna get a deviated septum surgery back In April and the doctor told me I couldn't smoke the month before so I had to stop in march. After the surgery, he advised that I didn't smoke for a little while and I decided to just keep going. 


**I analyzed the ever loving shit out of the task at hand** when I first stopped. I discovered that my mind was terrified of quitting smoking because it was so integrated into everything I did. Eating, drinking, driving...I decided to start simple. The last week as a smoker, I ""quit smoking"" in my car. It was difficult but at least I could smoke when before or after. When it finally came time to completely stop, the muscle memory for car smoking was already kind of dulled down.


Also, the oral fixation was a big concern of mine.


I don't know how smoking works in your state, but here in NC, we pretty much can't smoke anywhere indoors, and I'll come back to that..
I knew that I needed to find something to latch onto after I stopped smoking, so I thought tic tacs would be a reasonable crutch. However, I was afraid that I might get tired of them, so I did something that I'm actually convinced was the reason I could successfully replace tic tacs with cigarettes:


I only sucked on tic tacs in places where it was legal to smoke.
Something people might not understand is that smoking is an incredibly social activity. I actually lamented the loss of my smoke break, my inability to chit chat and form relationships with smoking co workers at my new job...but mostly, I just loved sitting on my back porch with a cigarette!


Did I have to give all of that up? Hell no. The only thing I gave up was cigarettes. For about a month, whenever I wanted a tic tack I'd put on my coat, go outside, sit down and enjoy a couple tic tacs and when I was finished, I went back inside.


I'm in a restaurant? I just finished my meal and want a tic tac?
Nope, illegal to smoke inside, illegal to have a tic tac inside. I think this seriously is the reason why up to this point I've been successful at quitting:my new temporary vice never got boring because I set conditions that I'd already grown accustomed to with smoking! I outgrew the need for tic tacks before they got boring


The months behind me incentivize the years ahead, and if I ever have an urge or a trigger (which I don't think will ever stop, and I'm ok with that) I just step outside and have a tic tac :)


Oh, for reference:
[i checked this regularly in the first days/weeks and it helped me stay motivated](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html)""I got more stubborn than the fuckin' darts.

I started at 18 on cigars while I drank. Then moved to cigs because they had filters, convincing myself that they were ""less dangerous"". Hah. Smoked on and off for 8 years (more on than off, I'd go maybe 2 weeks without tops every year or so). I told myself that I'll be damned if I am caught smoking for 10 years, fuck that noise.

I tried prescriptions, I tried patches (helped a little), I tried inhalers. The only thing that got me on the right track was the lozenges. I cut back to 3 a day on my own, but I couldn't seem cut it out completely. One in the morning, one after lunch, and one after supper. In between, I stuck with the lozenges. I did that for about 3 days, and realized I'm not helping myself, because my body is still craving the nicotine. I fucking quit after that for ~1 year.

I've had cigars on vacation in Florida, only because it was a debauchery kind of thing. I spend 50 bucks on ""decent"" cigars, and only drank and smoked one night. I gave the rest of my cigars away because the next morning, I couldn't even stand to look at them, let alone smell them. I doubt I'll do that again. I also felt guilty as fuck, like I cheated myself. I kind of did.

I like the idea of having a ""streak"" of days smoke-free. That's what keeps me going. Every day I dont smoke is a victory over the darts. Fuck 'em.""Asthma and allergies. It got to a point where if I tried to smoke a cigarette, I couldn't breathe. Made quitting cold turkey pretty easy.

People make it out to be such a bigger deal than it is with their addiction, like they will die if they even begin to try to quit. It's just silly justification of not truly wanting to quit. Just be honest with yourself.

I felt like I had the flu for 3 days, after that it was almost all mental  fighting the desire to calm your nerves and how easily you get agitated. But I felt like the physical dependence as far as feeling shitty was more or less gone after those few days, and after a few weeks I was back to normal.

Sadly, I did replace it with eating and gained a ton of weight now that my appetite wasn't suppressed and I needed something to fill the cigarette void. So definitely try to avoid that pitfall and replace it with chewing gum or something.""I may not be the best person to comment as i was only smoking 1-3 cigarettes a day before i quit, but I still did manage to recently quit after smoking for 8 years. i was also a just got sick of what i was doing to my body. (also my girlfriend hated it!) one day i just decided to walk away from it. it has only been roughly 60 days smoke free but i still feel accomplished and much better about my health.""I was on a trip where it was impossible to get a hold of them little fuckers. When I came back home I said ""fuck it"" and never bought one again. 

Sports are a good way to reduce anxiety. Whenever you find yourself in a situation that may trigger cravings  ( a night out drinking, other smoker friends, a coffee break at work) chew a loot of gum and drink lots of water. These two relieved the sudden urges and helped me a lot. Also, tell anyone who once told you to stop that you're trying to, their excitement and that little "" good for you, good job"" can be a huge motivation.  ""I smoked for 32 years.   Wish I never started.

I quit (5 years now).

Tried and tried.

What worked for me was Champix/Chantix but with some REAL CAVEATS!

It did numb the cravings and make quitting way easier but at a price.

The price was, it changes who you are for a while.  I had ZERO patience with anything.   My wife did the same and turned into GODZILLA!   That being said, I researched it and found that after we had 'ramped up' onto our dose (ramp on and off!  This is a must!), we cut it back to 50% of the suggested daily dose and we still had the effects, but somewhat less of the personality disorders.

Also NOTE: You may feel suicidal or violent.  It's important to have someone monitoring your behavior and temperament while on this.  Some folks don't have any issues.   But IT DOES WORK!   There's just a cautious trade off.

Other news:
I have a buddy who is the absolute KING of quitting smoking.  I've known him for 16 years and this guy has ""quit"", literally(!) once or twice a year.   I never would have guessed what worked for him.

Hypnosis!  The guy he went to was strictly word of mouth and spent a solid 6-7 hours just talking to him about his life, smoking, exercise, happiness, etc.  Only after this and asking him questions like ""When I say blah blah - what exactly is in your head when you hear that?"",  ""Do you see the *word* in your head, or an image?"", stuff like that.

Then, the next day, he came back for about 2-3 hrs and during that was hypnotized.   

He hasn't smoked in 3 years.   Longest he *ever* went was about 4-5 months.   

Now, also, let me say that I was freaked when he told me he was doing hypno.   He is SOOOO NOT a guy to buy into the whole new age, hocus pocus shit.  But he did it because he felt he was going to throw it all at the wall and *hope* something 'stuck'.

I have, over the last 3 years, repeatedly asked him ""So, what's the deal?  Any puffs?  Do you *really* think it was the hypno?  ...Come on!  Seriously?  Honest now.""  etc.

It freaking worked.   I looked the guy up that he went to and he is no ""Yellow Pages"" kind of hypnotist.  This guy is the real deal if ever there was one (and I am a skeptical MuthaFucka!).

Based on my buddy's experience I have changed my opinion of the validity of Hpyno.  Not entirely, but enough to not rule it out ever again.

Ultimately, cold turkey is having willpower over yourself.   If you are not a willful person in general.  Likely CT aint gonna do it unless you're looking at at blotch on your chest X-ray.  You'll need help whether that's a support group, or drugs, or whatever.   

Best of luck.

That's my anecdotal."Will power. It was mind over matter for me"I got to the point where smoking was no longer enjoyable for me.  I hated waking up with a sore throat after a hard night of drinking and chain smoking.  I hated coughing up things, and it even got to the point where I hated the actually act of smoking.  I decided one day that I was going to just stop, and I did.  The first 3 days sucked, but after that it was good to go.  I did end up gaining about 5 pounds though."/r/electronic_cigarette nuff saidWanted that to be a real thing..."Smoked from the age of 17 to about 34. I had toyed with quitting a few times over the years (especially towards the end), but it never stuck. Smoking was simply too large a part of how I envisioned myself.

Finally, I quit for my girlfriend (now wife). We were getting really serious and she really wanted me to quit. It just seemed like the right reason -- to do it for her. I don't think I would have ever done it ""for myself"". I think that you just need to find a reason to quit that truly means something to you. Maybe you do it for yourself, maybe for someone else, but it has to be for something that you really prioritize more than smoking. In my case that was my wife.

BTW -- I finally quit by simply going cold turkey. Not saying it was easy, but that is how I did it. I had tried the gum in my previous failed attempts at quitting, but that just seemed to drag out the misery of eventually trying to get off entirely. I am of the opinion that there is a tremendous about of hype out there supporting the notion that it is really, really hard to quit smoking. I also am of the opinion that this is just fine with the tobacco companies as this notion creates a very difficult mental barrier for anyone who is thinking about no longer being a consumer of their products. It is not easy to break any habit, but it is possible to stop if it is truly a goal you set for yourself.""I quit cold turkey. I am not going to lie, it still fucks with me and it has been 5+ years. I still get a craving and sometimes when I get really hammered I bum a smoke from a stranger and then I usually get sick. In those 5 years Id say I had one or two cigarettes per year if I was drunk enough. It is all mental, if you keep stringing it along with the gum and the e-cigs I don't think youll ever quit.

Buy a fuck load of gum and just sever ties with the smokes. just do it.""I also have had many attempts at quitting until i finally succeeded. What i did do differently when i managed to quit were the following : 
1. Eat oranges when you feel the craving to smoke. You will be eating lots in the first month after quitting.
2. Work out. When you work out you help your body eliminate the toxins that keep you addicted.
These 2 things helped me quit. I'm not saying you don't need will power but doing these 2 things can help a lot. Hope this helps you quit, GL.""E-Cigs.  I had a respiratory infection a couple years ago and couldn't smoke for at least a week or so.  So I had some time to think about it.  I didn't really WANT to quit smoking, I just knew it was terrible and I SHOULD stop.

After researching, I decided to try E-Cigs.  Whatever you believe about how healthy or not they are doesn't matter for this example.  They're ALMOST as good as smoking regular cigarettes, and my desire to smoke went down and down.  I could quit entirely if I wanted to now.  I sometimes go weeks without taking a drag off of one.  I now enjoy them only when I feel like it.  (a social drink, sometimes with coffee, etc)  I probably ""vape"" around a pack's worth a cigarettes a MONTH.  

The desire just went away.  Smoking 11-16mg of nicotine e-cigs."Getting Sick was my strategy for stopping. I made my mind up that i wanted to quit so i made a deal with myself that the next time I got sick I would quit smoking. (cause I never really felt like smoking when i was sick so i thought it would be the perfect time.) Cold turkey was the only way for me and its been 15years."Just stop buying and stop being so weak. Whatever is troubling you is in the past. Hakuna Matata. In all reality, ridding yourself of the drama inducing elements helps, but excuses otherwise just conclude you are indeed lazy and wasting money on a drug that is killing you. I stopped smoking by first using Logic vapes for a couple of months then finally stopped. Be something other that THAT."I wanted to change something about myself. I stuck to it. At first I shortened the amount (one in the morning and one in the evening until eventually just one in the evening). I smoke pot. So eventually I only smoked pot once per evening in place of my cigarette. I haven't bought a pack in over half a year. Feels high man."When I was in the armed forces I quit for six months before going to boot camp. The way I went about it was to just study my research material whenever I had a nic-fit. Not only did I quit but I also learned that book front to back and went to basic training several steps ahead of everybody else.

Better believe my ass started smoking again pretty much as soon as the military would let me, though.""Waking up in the middle of the night and coughing until I vomited. That's when I decided I need to stop. I still dream about smoking a cigarette, I still feel the need to smoke, but every day without smoking make me feel so proud. I quit many times before and the thing that always got me back was thinking ""Oh I havent smoked for half a year, one cigarette with a beer won't make me an addict again"". That's why I don't count the days without a cigarette anymore. When you quit, you have to quit for the rest of your life.""Having my lung collapse.

Actually had quit about a month before this happened but this wasnt my first time trying to quit. The lung collapse helped me stay quit. 

Fear is a great motivator. Was too scared to put anything bad into my lungs after knowing what it feels like to not be able to breath properly, having a bunch of tubes shoved in me and having to have surgery. Had been smoke free for over 10 years now, dont even miss it.

Interesting side note: I do have occasional ""nightmares"" where I am smoking in my dream and realize that Im not supposed to be smoking so I get really upset at myself in my dream. I am totally relieved when I wake up and realize I was just dreaming""Three things:

An E-Cig, having a bottle of water in my hand at all times, a false positive on a cardiac test that scared the crap out of me.

OK, maybe it was that last one that really did it.""Chantix.  I've heard all about the side effects and I was pretty nervous.  The only time I'd quit before was using the acculaser therapy that was hyped up a few years ago, but it only worked for a month.  I used chantix for a few weeks before tapering off and then fully quitting.  There wasn't any depression or mood swings or other side effects save for vivid dreams.  They were the best dreams ever!  The most memorable involved me at the local bar drinking with Mitt Romney who was campaigning for the election that had already passed.  I was nominated to tell him he lost and he got sad and his face got small and his head got bigger.  The next thing I know we've stolen and ambulance and crashed into a culvert on a highway.  BEST.  DREAM.  EVER.  Oh yeah, I've been smoke free since 4/17/13.  I know it's not terribly long but it's great not smoking and the cravings I do get are pretty easy to suppress.""I started smoking for the very same reason. Some time later after several failed attempts to quit I got cancer. Turns out to be totally unrelated to smoking but 8 months of chemo was sufficient evidence that I needed to stop.

I hope you find something short of that that well convince you.""I'm not a smoker, but my boss used to be before I met him. He told me that a big part of quitting was he started snacking on sunflower seeds. Kept his mouth busy with something that wasn't terrible for him."Snus"E-cigs. Quit smoking, and picked up a cool hobby!

They allowed me split the detox from the excess nitrogen and carbon monoxide, and the nicotine withdrawal into two experiences, instead of one suckfest. Steadily dropping down the nicotine level, but I'm not even really worried about it, as nicotine isn't that bad. It's all the other shit in cigarettes that kills you.

Your mileage may vary, but I haven't had a cigarette since last May.""I told my girlfriend I was going to quit and she mocked me, saying ""*Look at me, I'm [noturbob], I'm going to quit!* No you won't. You don't have the will power to do anything let along quit smoking."" I put out my cigarette and crumpled up the rest of my pack right then and there. We broke up a week later and I haven't smoked since. It's been 15 years.

So... Anger. And proving people wrong. That's what helped me go cold turkey.

(Also, when the cravings and chest tightness became too strong, I would hold my head underwater for as long as I could, or at least until I couldn't tell the difference between lungs burning from holding my breath and lungs tight from wanting a cigarette.  Edit to add one more technique I would use when I wasn't near a bathtub or a body of water: I would take a pen that was about the diameter of a cigarette and wrap one layer of cloth tape around the end of it. When I had a craving, I would pretend to light it then take imaginary drags off of it. It was amazing how the mere routine of smoking could help reduce the cravings.)"My mom smoked 2 packs a day for 30+ years and then went to see a hypnotist with her friend in order to quit. Neither of them have touched a cigarette since. It's crazy but I can tell you it works.Better electronic one."I'm late to the game, but I smoked marijuana instead.  Then I quit marijuana.  I'm clean on both for 7 years."Girlfriend doesn't like smoking....I like sex more then smoking."I agree with cold turkey. After four years of smoking a pack a day, I just decided to actually quit. Two months down. "Getting pregnant :) the last time I smoked was on my way to buy a pregnancy test with my first. Haven't had one since.. (It's been 3 years now)Having children...."I took up ecigs. Sure, it seems like an awesome alternative, I love them. But, being able to not rely on or crave anything at all is nice. I used ecigs for several months after several years of smoking, but i quit unintentionally. I visited home for a bit and was around family so I held back. Near the end of my vacation I realized I went 3 days without smoking or vaping. I had no intentions to quit but reached a point where I just thought 'hmm, if I really wanted to I could stop now and save money.' I'm 2-3 weeks clean, and its alright, but I'll always have urges. I've quit like this a lot, and honestly, I'll probably pick it up again. Ecigs sound like a good idea, and they are awesome for quitting, but more than likely it will only replace real smoking. Its an awesome alternative, but if you really want to quit go cold turkey and tough it out.""I used gum, but it only took because I could point to a time and place where I really didn't want to be a smoker, and I kept that in mind when I had cravings. I was going on a beach vacation with my then-girlfriend's (now wife) family, and there were going to be 6 kids with us under the age of 12. I didn't want to have to lie or explain why I had to ""take a walk"" every hour or two and tell them that they couldn't come along. The vacation was planned about 6 months in advance, and by the time we hit the beach, I was completely off the gum for months. 



tl;dr
If you can find a specific reason you won't want to smoke, it will make quitting a million times easier.""Cold turkey.  The last pack of cigarettes I purchased was in October 2012.  I was going over my, and my wife's, finances and I realized that our 1 pack/day @ $6 a pack was costing us around $85 a week.  That's $4420 a year just in cigarettes.  At that time, I was making $12.50 an hour which is roughly $25,000 a year.  My wife was making around $30,000.  8% of our income every year was going to cigarettes.  I decided right then and there, that I was smoking the last pack of cigarettes I would ever purchase.

I didn't throw that pack away.  I paid for it.  I derived some amount of pleasure from them.  I just decided that the pleasure wasn't worth the cost.  The pack ran out.  I had 3 days of feeling like shit.  Then I got over it.

My advice to quit smoking: Go cold turkey.  Grow up. Make a decision to stop.  Stick to your guns.  The longterm cravings are psychological, they can't effect you if you know that the decision was one that made because you WANTED to, and for no other reason than that.  You have to want it."for me it was having a baby. i tried everything but that was the life change that gave me the motivation to quit. 3 years strong now :D"Firstly, you have to want to give up. Second, once you have given up for a bit, few days, whatever, if you fuck up and buy another pack at the store, even if you light up once, throw the rest of that pack away. It gets expensive real fast. Eventually you will stop buying packs or be so broke you won't be able to.""I smoked a whole pack while drinking heavily the night before and woke up the next morning with the taste of a bottle depo in my mouth. It was a brutal hangover and couldn't touch a smoke that whole day.

I became a hermit on day 2 and 3 and played completely though Portal 1 and 2.

Day 4 was hard so I bought an E-Cig which held me over. Every day after that became easier and easier. Anyone can quit smoking, you just can't let yourself down and give up on it. Just take it day by take.

Now sugar, that's an addiction. ""Smoked for 10 years more than 25 a day.

One day I was walking in the garden and stopped. Then I was thinking 'what's that awful smell here?' and realized it was my own odor I was carrying. 
Then I realized I had yellow fingers and that I was constantly busy in my head with the number of cigarettes that were left in the package, and where I could buy new ones.

Decided that that was the wrong way of living a life. Stopped cold turkey, bam!

Now 10 years clean and running ultra-marathons. ""You need to do it for yourself. Not anyone else. Lots of people say they did it for their kid, their spouse, etc. Well what happens if they leave this earth? It can happen to anyone. You should plan accordingly.""This comment surely will be downvoted to hell but here we go - what helped me quit after 6 years is actually switching from prefabricated cigarettes to rolling tobacco. The process of switching was actually a challenge all by itself - manufactured cigarettes are much more addictive than regular tobacco, etc. 

The idea behind switching to rolling tobacco is, well, to only roll a cigarette when you really want to smoke. Sometimes, if not most of the time, you only smoke not because you actually want to smoke but because you don't know what to occupy yourself with, and the presence of a pack of fags on the table does not exactly help it. So the goal is - you want to smoke --> you have to work a little for that by rolling a cigarette. This way, I stopped smoking twice an hour the first week, smoked once in 3 hours the following week, etc - you stop consuming as much tobacco because, well, you become lazy to roll. After that, getting rid of tobacco was not such a big issue for me - the first two days were the hardest of course but days after that have become manageable. 

**TL,DR** : Rolling tobacco will make you lazy to roll. ??? PROFIT."I went cold turkey once and it worked. Started smoking 2 years ago and wanna stop again. Gotta believe."Chantix got me going, but like everyone says, you have to have your mind made up. To push through it, the voices in my head had a daily argument...voice 1 ""No way, I can't take this anymore, I 'm going to buy a pack"" voice 2 "" Whoa, hang on, ok so your saying we're going to start back... We'll fine, do me one favor, let's just wait until tomorrow and I promise I won't say a word"" .aaaand that conversation went on for months."I wanted tosnus.cold turkey doesn't work for everyone. Come on over to /r/electronic_cigarette"Cold turkey. I started smoking on and off when I was 18, and continued untuil I was about 26 or 27 at varying amounts. Near the end I was smoking around a pack a day. I got to a point where I did not like the way it made me feel and I had just had enough. It sounds like you are there too.

So, cold turkey. It took a few false starts, but then finally I just did it. One thing I found that absolutely helped was to make sure I completely banned doing it when my big trigger hit. For me it was driving. I used to smoke 3 or 4 on the way to and from work. When I got a new car, I made it a rule that I would not smoke in it. Even though the trigger was there, I eliminated it as a reason to smoke, and the rest eventually came fairly easy.

The first two weeks for me were hard. Cravings like all day every day. And yes you feel like crap too. Find something else to occupy your thoughts and do something else for that whole oral fixation thing. After the first two weeks though, the physical cravings died down significantly. I still got those urges, but they were easily manageable.

It has been about 3 years now? And I have lost all desire to smoke whatsoever. I went to a bachelor party a few months ago and it was going to be my cheat weekend. I smoked one cigarette and found it so thoroughly revolting that I know I am done for good.

Feel free to respond here or send a message if you have any other questions. And good luck!"Nortriptyline and Tetris. Cold turkey. I only get the craving every couple months now - it's been 18 years."Probably too late for this but I thought I'd share anyway. Smoked here and there for a while, then went on deployment where I smoked like crazy- at least half a pack a day which even then was a shit ton for me. Came back and my fiancÌ©e just wouldn't have it- if I came from anywhere smelling like smoke it would be a huge fight and lighting up at home or anywhere near her was completely out of the question. It got to the point where it wasn't worth it and I stopped smoking and we stopped fighting about it, almost a year and a half later I haven't had a cigarette since. I agree with others in this thread that the craving never goes away completely, but no matter how ok you think you feel now, your lungs and heart will feel so much better and your sense of smell and taste will come back- so much so that it will act as a huge deterrent to ever starting up again.""I also smoked for many years, at least a pack a day. After getting short breathed and other health issues, I decided I really should quit. It took me about four attempts (some serious, some not), but I'm now going into my 6th smoke-free year, and I couldn't be happier.

Cold turkey is by far the best way to go, just throw away your pack and you're good to go. Two things really helped me to keep it up. First, I knew I would never ever smoke a cigarette again. I can't smoke on occassion, so it is all or nothing. In this case, nothing. 

An other thought that really helped was thinking, after getting through the first (awful) day: ""I made it through the first day. If I smoke one cigarette, I had to go through a terrible day for nothing."" That helped me to get through the second day. And I kept thinking that, if I light up one cigarette, all these shitty days were for nothing. And after two weeks, I felt better. And finally, after a year (going through all the situations where you would normally smoke), it wasn't really on my mind anymore.

And don't forget, you also can do the things you did while you were smoking, without a cigarette. I regularly go outside, and take a break. No need to light up though. Just keep that in mind and you can do it!""Altoids! Yeah those really strong mints, suck on one or two every hour or when you crave a smoke and do breathing exercises also.  It also really really helps to start an exercise routine /going to gym even if it's just walking a treadmill. Oh, and for me,  planning and counting down never worked. Just a random ""fuk this!"" And cold Turkey right there. ""I quit cold turkey in a way. My doctor said pick a day, cut back as best you can but keep that day. On the day I quit, I had 4 cigs in a pack, they lasted me 4 days then done. I have not smoked in over 4 years. I was a smoker for 20. Now I can't stand to be around smokers, the smell is so bad. I'm sorry I was that guy for so long. ""discipline. i quit cold turkey after just 8 consecutive years. sure, maybe it wasnt 30 years, but discipline is what it takes.""V2 eCig. Was best compared to a bad orgasm--it's not great, but it's still good enough to get the job done. Took a few days to get used to the switch, but I would make the effort to take the same cig breaks at work with the eCig that I did with the real one--so actually go stand out side and puff on the thing for 3 minutes. Eventually, the need to use it just phased itself out without much conscious effort on my part. ""You will only quit (for good) when you are MENTALLY ready to quit.  All of the smoking aids will help break the physical addiction, but if you are not mentally prepared, forget it.
""Pick a date, anywhere between 2 weeks or 2 months out, and quit cold turkey.  Make that day the last day of smoking.  Mine was the 4th of July.  I smoked myself sick that day because I knew it was my last.  I didn't even feel like smoking the next day but the 2nd and 3rd day off were really rough.  It worked though! It gets much easier after about a week.""Honestly I got tired of having it on my to-do list. I didnt give a shit about cancer or smelling bad or tasting bad or whatever. almost 3 weeks without a cigarette so far. I think Ive kicked it, but I am avoiding getting drunk around my friends who smoke. the only time i want one now is when im drinking or listening to music that references it.""0) quit drinking.  I don't think I could ever have quit smoking without quitting drinking first.  

1) smoked 8 years.  towards the end, started smoking cigars as well as cigarettes - it was like switching from beer to whiskey.  It felt like my smoking was getting kind of out of hand.  In the last couple years I seriously tried quitting two or three times but failed. 

2) for a few weeks, started putting off the morning cigarette, on the idea that the longest time you go without nicotine is while sleeping, and I'd just try to extend that.  

3) at some point I put off the morning cigarette the whole day, and never started back.  

4) for the first week I had to keep myself from going to get cigs about every five minutes.  for the second week it was more like 10 minutes.  After that it got much easier.  As time went by I'd just get tempted around less frequent events where I used to smoke - concerts, end of a big meal, etc.  

5) aerobic exercise was helpful - after exercise was about the only time I'd feel a little relaxed.  ""I started smoking weed.

I'm pretty sure I only started smoking tobacco because I was in the military and there are HUGE chunks of time where all one has to do is smoke, so I picked up the habit.

Once I got out I picked up a new habit, then, one day, while working outside I decided to go have a smoke. I lit up a cigarette, took that first drag, said to myself 'This tastes like shit' and put it out.""Quit cold turkey. Knew I had to quit smoking, said ""this is my last pack"" and never looked back. I smoked for about 6 years and wanted to give it up. I had tried cutting down and using gum but no luck. Yeah it sucked the first few days, and I got a bit cranky but you just need to distract yourself with something else. You need to mean it when you say you want to quit, or else you'll fail every time. If the cravings were really bad while I was at home, I'd smoke a bowl/joint and that helped a lot! Anyways, I quit cold turkey and its been just over a year now, cigarettes now make me feel sick. :)""Nasty but it works.  Get a 2 liter bottle. Fill it up half with water. Ash in it. Throw your butts in it. Do this for a week. DRINK IT.  You will throw up. But afterwards the smell will make you want to vomit. You won't smoke again. Crazy voodoo man told me. I quit cold turkey. My peak was 2packs a day. ""Absolutely cold turkey.  I've posted about this before, but it's the ONLY way I was able to quit after smoking for 10 years.""You have to have something which makes smoking immediately worse than not smoking. 
I knew about the health problems. I knew my lung capacity was less than it could be, which was a big issue because I was a professional ballet dancer at the time. I knew a hundred reasons why i wanted to quit, but one thing kept me smoking (in addition to the nicotine), I LOVED SMOKING.
The thing that made me quit was my now wife, then GF. She would NEVER say anything, but when I would come back inside from having a smoke and would snuggle up next to her on the couch to continue watching the movie, i could SEE that i smelled HORRIBLE to her. And, bless her, she was trying so HARD to not let it show.
That is what did it for me. The thought of being repulsive in any way to my wife is unbearable to me. Whenever I would want a smoke, there was a clear, immediate consequence:
""You will be a repulsive stinky bastard to your girl, who is such an angel that she will not say anything and just be miserable till it dissipates.""
That is what broke it for me.""I was a pretty heavy smoker, 1 1/2 packs a day, I went cold turkey til I couldn't handle it anymore.  Then I threw on a patch and I felt instant relief,  after that, I had faith in the patch"Pretty much cold turkey. I had the lozenges that I used to get me through the tough cravings but I tried to use them sparingly. Eventually I just quit thinking about it. "I'm an anesthesiologist. I ask every patient that I've ever care for if they smoke or ever smoked. 

If they tell me they used to smoke,but quit, I ask them how they quit.  I grew up in a family of smokers, including my physician father who continued to smoke after being diagnosed cancer and quitting smoking is an interest of mine. I never smoked. 

Every single successful quitter (now there's  a funny phrase) I ever cared for told be a variation of ""I just quit.""  I did have on patient tell me he quit using the patch and someone I met socially told me he quit after one hypnosis session, but every other successful quitter quit by quitting. 

That may not be data, but it's a lifetime of the same anecdote. ""After 13 years smoking I woke up one morning with the worst headache ever.  I attempted to stand but one of my legs had simply stopped working.  I had my wife call 911 because I thought it was a stroke.  Turns out, smoking had done so much damage to my circulatory system that my leg was dying from lack of oxygen.  I was treated and told that if I didn't quit smoking, I would lose my leg.  I didn't care that I would get cancer and die.  I didn't want to live with only one leg.  Cold turkey. I never smoked another cigarette.  ""Broke my pack-a-day habit by: 

1. Being tired of everything smelling like smoke
2. Wanting to taste food again
3. Tired of scheduling my day around my habit
4. Having friends that were supportive/tolerant 
5. Using a Nicotine patch, which got me started, but then cold turkey
6. Reminding myself ""I don't smoke"" whenever a craving came up (and twenty years later, I still get cravings)
"Willpower. Cold turkey. Redirect your addictive behavior toward not smoking. It worked for me. Same for nutrition and workout. Use a bad behavior toward something healthy.I finally quit for good after several tries by choosing a time at the HEIGHT of personal stress. I did use the patch for about 4 days. I figured that if I didn't while stressed I would have no excuses to take it up again and I didn't. Bronchitis"Cold turkey. Never tried any other ways though. I quit once about a year ago and ended up smoking again after moving into a new place with roommates who shared the same friend groups, and subsequently partied a lot more. But now that things have settled down around the house I quit again and really just don't even think about them other than when I get asked by people with a poor memory if I want to go smoke one. Probably has been something like 6-7 months although im not really positive.""I started work at a new job where my boss doesn't smoke. I really like my boss, and I wanted to impress him by quitting. If he started smoking, I'd definitely start too. But he's a total health nut, so there's that.
""I don't know if this really qualifies me as ever having been addicted but I smoked for two years and only a few times a month maybe would I feel the NEED to smoke. In hindsight it was dumb. It was a social thing and I enjoyed it, there was definitely an oral fixation with the smoke too but ultimately I just... stopped. I never once felt like I depended on it. I recently picked up smoking an e-cig (not in order to quit, I ""quit"" long before I considered vaping) as a more recreational thing because there are a ridiculous amount of nice flavors and I can do it in-doors. ""I tried to quit for many years using many methods. In the end it was actually very easy to quit cold turkey. Just think about it this way:

You are always going to want to smoke but its important to keep choosing no. To start with this will happen quite a lot (choosing no) but will become less frequent as time passes. 5 years after stopping I still had to choose no, when I occasionally had a craving out of the blue. 

Also, take up running or cycling and challenge yourself to improve. Smoking gets on the way of getting faster / fitter so put this in its place. 

Stay strong, its really not that bad. "I started SCA Heavy Fighting.  Not being able to keep up with kids 10 years younger than me motivated me to kick the habit.  I did and now I'm in the best shape of my life.  "My room mate did it with chantix and the will to quit. She'd had enough of it i think and I prodded a little when I met her, but not too much cuz it doesn't really bother me what other people choose to do with their bodies. But she did it and has been a year and .. probably going on two years smoke free now. She said Chantix gave her wicked weird/vivid dreams/bordering on nightmares, though, so it was wonky for a while.""eCigarettes. 

Tried cold turkey, tried gum. Never tried patches because they're expensive.

I smoked 10-20 a day for a decade, bought an e-cig and haven't smoked 'properly' since - I had a drag of my girlfriends when I was drunk and hated it. ""I think it's not so much the method but the motivation. You have to really, really want to quit. You have to convince yourself that it's not pleasurable or desirable, and I mean really. You can't want to quit because ""well, I know it's bad for me"" and yadda yadda. You have to be disgusted by cigarettes, you have to convince yourself that you hate the taste and the feeling and everything about it. And why would you continue to do something that you hate? It's strange, the kind of games you can play with your own brain to convince it that things are true, but that's kind of what I had to do. Your mileage may vary.""I kept hearing about people dying of throat cancer. George Harrison's (Beatle George) death finally convinced me.. too many people dying from this (and other diseases caused by smoking). I quit cold turkey. Had trouble for a while but eventually the withdrawal pressure waned. This was 10+ years ago after smoking 25 years. I'm still smoking occasionally in my dreams (couple of times a year). In fact, there's a dresser drawer in one of my dreams that has a pack in it. I've been there in more than one dream. You will get through it. Tough for a few weeks, perhaps a month or more, but it WILL pass. Best of luck...""Maybe I'm a little bit late to the show:

I started smoking when I was about 15-16 and did it for 4 years.
What I did to quit was to trick my body to accept a substitute for smoking that was less severe.

Basically, 3 times a day I would have myself a cup of coffee and when I had finished it, I would light 1 cigarette and finish half of it.

Then for the second week I would finish 1/4th after each cup.

Then after the second week, when I had associated coffee with minor nicotine relief, I would have myself a cup of coffe when I felt the urge.

I got pissy for three days and after that I just silently and contently had myself a cup.

Then to stop drinking coffee I swapped it out with tea.

This doesn't make you addiction free, this just makes you addicted to something better I suppose. I couldn't live without waking up with tea in the morning and midday and at 4.""cold turkey, or, just not physically being able to smoke anymore, i had only smoked for 4 years, but i had come to a point where i would get half way through a cigarette and i just stopped half way through a pack, threw it out, and quit....""Well after my first drag I just looked at my friend and asked him: Are you insane there isn't even a kick, no rush no nothing just bad taste and high costs. And that is when I quit smoking.""Cold turkey.  It's the opposite of drinking too much alcohol...the bad effects come first, and the good effects come later.""the price.  I could not afford smokes for a long time and just hated paying those prices, so i just quit.  ""My daughter came home from school and said. ""If you don't stop smoking you will die. Don't you want to be alive to see me grow up?"" I have not smoked since that day. No gum no patch nothing. I think you just have to really want to stop. that was 7 years ago.""Vaping. Nothing else helped me, not patches, not cold turkey, not 'cutting down'. But switching to electronic is working out perfectly. Mind you, you need to invest a little bit into quality equipment and e-liquid. I started of with a CE4 and 24mg liquid, right now i'm down to 12mg."ecig/vaporizer. ITT: Cold turkey."I'm in the process of quitting now (was my New Year's resolution), so I can tell you what's working for me:

CHANTIX

Really, that's the biggest key for my efforts as it stops me from gaining any satisfaction from a cigarette - even if/when I do cheat and smoke.  It makes them taste bad, and there's no ""Ahhhhhh"" factor anymore.  From what my Dr. has told me, they are seeing over an 80% success rate in Chantix if the person remains on it for 4-6 months.  My plan is to at least give it a full 4 months.  I've semi-successfully used Chantix in the past but only stayed on it for 2 months which ended up in me smoking again.  Plus I really wasn't quite ready back then.

The biggest problems I run into are continual triggers and just breaking the ""habitual routine"" part since Chantix is taking care of the actual need.

I'm only 3 weeks into the process (which means 2 since my quit date), but I'm finally starting to notice a decrease in the desires when I do get triggered.  I still haven't really found a replacement for all those times throughout the day where I'm used to having a smoke break, but I'm beginning to notice that those times come and go without quite as much notice now.

In the end, it's really not easy - even with medication.  My quit coach told me when I'm fighting that urge to remind myself why I'm doing this.  At first that seemed a little silly, but now it's starting to actually work for me.  My 2 main driving reasons are my kids, and the money I'm saving.  Granted, I'm on a pretty short reward system right now for the money (hey, I can buy X for myself because I already saved this much $) but I really do think that's an important aspect - at least for me.

What works for you will ultimately be a combination of your own priorities and what triggers your personal drive.  I would absolutely recommend some kind of way to reward yourself for the efforts though because I do know that can and will become a huge driving force in itself.  It doesn't necessarily have to involve buying something, but reinforcing good behavior in some kind of way (particularly if you can make it structured on a sliding schedule) really helps a lot!

GOOD LUCK, I really hope you find your way to succeed.  Just remember, the 3rd Marlboro Man just recently died - and that's the role model the industry sets for us.""Cold turkey and willpower. Now I can't STAND second hand smoke. And I smoked for 10 years.  
  
It took me about 3 years off and on to quit smoking. At first I just started smoking later and later in the day (no cig with morning coffee was the hardest part) and eventually I was able to only smoke in the evenings and then just one before going to bed. At that point, I had just about quit and it took me a while to actually break that last one before bed ritual.  
  
Also, it helps to live in a cold area and only allow yourself to smoke outside, even in the winter, even if all your friends are smoking inside.""My mum smoked from 13 until she was 29. It was love for my dad that made her quit. 

She told me that when she realised she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him, and that her habit meant they wouldn't get as many years together, she quit cold turkey and never looked back. 

My parents are still happily married and now in their mid fifties.""It's all mental. It's really fucking hard but you don't NEED anything except will power.  If someone said they would pay you a million dollars to quit for a week, I guarantee you wouldn't give in to the craving. ""Getting into mountain biking, and ecigs.

Uhm,, seems to me it only worked once if you actually did it twice. 

""I started smoking cigarettes when I was about seventeen, and a year or so later, in college is when i quit. so I didn't smoke for very long.
I had gone to this relaxation seminar at my school; we did meditation, tai chi, and drank some tea. There was also a health counselor there giving neck rubs. While she was rubbing my neck, she was also giving me reiki (energy healing). She held her hands in front of my face for a few seconds and then asked me, ""So when are you going to quit smoking?""
That really freaked me out because I hadn't smoked at all that day and had never met this woman, so she had no physical indication that I was a smoker. She could feel it on an energetic level. I said, ""I guess today"" and haven't had a cigarette since."I failed at least 50 times and thought I would never kick the habit. Just keep trying. Smoke free for a year now. "I guess the straightforward answer would be the GUM but it comes down to more than that for me.
I had a little pressure from the new company I started working at.
Plus moving to a small progressive city where very few people smoked has certainly helped. I guess not seeing people smoke when you are trying to quit helps because you just think about smoking less. Also I used to have friends that smoked and quitting while hanging out with them was nearly impossible. Now none of the friends I have smoke and I think they all look down on it a little, so stepping out for a cig really made me feel a little embarrassed.
Also I have became very interested in rock climbing and hiking and in order to make noticeable progress I had to get more into shape and after a while I could see that smoking was a hinderance. I am very competitive so I took training and conditioning seriously enough to also make me think about quitting.

All of those things combine were enough to help me quit and stay quit""Ive smoked for 4 years.. How did I quit? I thought of my life and how my insides would look if I continue. Also, imagine getting Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Terrifying. I want to live longer and feel better, simple as that. If you cant hold urself then ur NOT trying hard enough. You wont feel well, ofc.. But just take a straw and breath through it, you want that.. or do you want to due a terrible death..? Think.""I smoked 20 to 30 cigarettes a day for a few years.  I got a really bad case of bronchitis and I got sick and tired of being sick and tired.  After that I cut back to about 5 to 10 per day, and I found that there was an negative relationship between number of cigarettes smoked at parties and both the quantity and quality of sexual encounters resulting from said parties.  That sealed the deal, and I haven't wanted a cigarette in almost two years.""I quit on 1/1/2013.
I smoked for about 16 years (half my life at the time) and about 1 pack a day.  My wife was disgusted with it, and I did my best to hide if from her.  
Finally I promised to quit.  I got Chantix from my dr.  When I started taking the Chantix it seemed like I didn't need to smoke, and just continued to do it out of habit.  As the quit time approached I was confident.  That day was HELL!  I could not sit still.  
I downloaded an app on my phone called cessation nation.  This helped me as I could see how much money I was saving.  Still every morning for about 100 days I was craving.  But after that things started to become clear to me that I was not going to smoke.  
Now the smell makes me sick to my stomach.  I don't even like to sit next to someone who smokes because of the awful smell.  The thought of having just one cigarette now is repulsive to me.""I have quit 2 times seriously (the second seems to be sticking). I say I quit once before because I went 9 months without smoking and didn't feel the need anymore. My downfall was getting piss drunk and thinking ... ohh its ok to just have one.

I quit the first time with chantix, which was wonderful. The reason I didn't go back to it was that it gave me fucked up dreams (like really fucked up). Other than that it was a good experience, take the pill and smoking isn't even enjoyable anymore. That meant that the two times I broke down and had a smoke I got some negative reinforcement.

This time I used e cigs to take the edge of for the first 2 weeks and have gone on fine since then.

The main things (no matter what method you choose) you personally need to want to stop smoking. Usually you have a multiple reasons (cost, smell, health). Use those and remind yourself about why smoking sucks every time you think about it. Try to convince you mind that you hate the habit. I hated feeling like it was controlling me.

The things that help a lot are exercise and support from people (and by support that meant people I didn't want to disappoint by failing). I tried the whole oral fixation thing 1st time around and chewed a ton of gum. I don't think it helped and now I chew gum religiously.

Since you have tried numerous times, try to figure out what keeps causing you to fail. And lastly remember that most people require multiple attempt to successfully quit. Keep you head up.""There is a medicine that takes the lust away.
Pop the pills for 7 days and you simply lose the urge to smoke. Then stay smoke free for a month. It becomes easier after that."Canadian WinterAfter trying several times to quit and failing I finally quit by being determined to not stop quiting.  If I gave in and had a smoke I'd just throw a patch back on and start again.  Eventually I just wore myself down.  I also had to write a note to myself that said no matter what I thought ever I could never put a ciggarette to my lips again with out being hooked.  Its been 14 years and haven't slipped yet but I still dream that I started smoking again and it takes me a while in the am to realize it was a dream and shake off the self disappointment. My grandma use to smoke 2 packs a day and when i was younger the doctor told her I have asthma. She instantly stopped and never smoked againe-cigs"I took Chantix for a month and it worked for me.  I was at about 5 packs per week and now I haven't had a cig in just over a year.

It really messed with my sleep cycle and I was irritable for a few months after I stopped taking it.  You need to REALLY WANT to quit.  You can't just think that you want to, you need to commit to it.  There will be hiccups, but you can't allow those to spiral into buying packs again.""I chose a date my birthday then purchased 2 weeks worth of patches. I used up the patches for the two weeks then was too cheap to buy more so stopped using that also. Almost a Month to the quit day it was New Years so decided to see what I was

All to impress some cunt, I guess have to thank her for the motivation.""I haven't had a cigarette in about four months thanks to using an e-cigarette/vaporizer.  I'm now almost to a point where I'm done using the e-cig as well (I started at 18mg nicotine and I've tapered it down to 6mg).

If cold turkey, patches, and gum aren't for you, I'd give it a shot.  The start-up costs can be a little high depending on which brand you get, but it's still much cheaper for you if you're a pack-a-day smoker."I quit after God addressed me directly and told me to.Pretty much when my dad died from lung cancer"One box of nicorette, then changed out for trident original.

As a fyi, a cigarette has about 18 mg of nicotine and the e-cigs nicotine can be as high as 18 also.

I took that oportunity and never smoked again.""Quitting smoking is like losing weight. We all are looking for a system or strategy, but there's no trick other than just to do it. To lose weight, you have to diet and exercise. To quit smoking, you just have to force yourself to stop smoking. It's a brutal few weeks, but you have no one but yourself to blame for getting addicted in the first place. I quit from a pack a day habit about two years ago, and I still get the occasional craving when I drink wine, but once the addiction is physically out of you, it's easier to handle. "Probably not helpful for OP but I quit cold turkey because I was flat broke and didn't have enough money to buy a pack of cigarettes"I started on a blu e-cig out of desperation to quit.

The exercise keeps you busy (I mostly smoked because I was bored or not moving much) and after a couple of runs/swims/bike rides, you'll realize how much smoking was really hurting you.

Also the natural high from cardio workouts serves as a good replacement to a nicotine buzz.""A promise to my girlfriend. It's nothing she made me do or anything, in fact it was entirely my idea. I just knew that if I promised her I wouldn't smoke any more I'd actually hold to it more tightly. I had wanted to quit for a long time and had been ramping down my intake for over a year - I was down to around 2-4 cigarettes a day at most before I went cold turkey.

I guess if you give in and go back on a private promise to yourself it's not usually seen as that bad, but not wanting to break a promise to someone you love can be motivating.""I stopped for a year, cold turkey.  I told myself that I could smoke again next year.  I did, but not as much.  The following year was no smoking again.  The year after that, I never bothered to start back up.  They say it takes an average of seventeen attempts to succeed at quitting.  I personally believe that the habit is harder to break than the addiction.  Perhaps restructure your trigger situations...""I just stopped buying them.

I know that won't cut it for most people, but it worked easily for me. After 2-3 days I never craved one unless I was drinking.""I did a week on the patch and went cold turkey. I just had my 35th birthday and was having more and more issues with coughing and being easily winded. I think I tried hundreds of other times before but succeded this time because I really set my mind to it. It took 4 months to stop craving nicotine and in that time the longer I was free of it, the easier it was to say, ""if I go back to them now I have to start this all over again"". At about two weeks in telling myself that helped. It really boils down to if you are really ready to give it up and accept you will be going through a rough couple months of withdrawals.

But, for what it's worth, here is my story.

I smoked for 5 years. Was up to almost 2 packs a day towards the end. I was very conscious about not trying to quit unless my heart was really in it. Had one failed quit attempt before.

Here is how I circumvented my brain:

I picked a quit date, and *did not tell anyone*. I feel that not telling anyone was an important part. Then I smoked super-hard for about a week. When I'd smoke too much, I would get gaggy and nauseated. I would then tell myself to remember this feeling.

On the quit date I went and got my first tattoo. I know this wouldn't work for everyone. I've been meaning to get a tattoo for a while, so it wasn't entirely and solely for quitting tabacco. But I did time getting the tattoo with the quit date, and mentally assigned the meaning to the tattoo. I think this probably helped me the most. I knew that I'd feel like an idiot with a permanent mark on my body that has had its meaning voided.

Early after quitting I had a dream that I lit up, and I got really sad about it. Almost to the point of tears. When I woke up, it took me a little while to realize that it was only a dream, and I didn't violate my deal. A book I read on quitting said that the craving for the cigarette will pass within a few minutes *regardless* if you smoke one or not. So no single cigarette craving has been enough for me to go back on my decision.

I also chewed nicotine gum for a couple of weeks. It gave me terrible heartburn, so I did not re-up after finishing the initial pack. I know, some people get hooked on the gum. Thankfully, it wasn't an option for me.

It's been 4 years, and I couldn't be happier about my decision and execution. That year I met a girl who I ended up marrying and we now have a beautiful baby girl. That would not have happened had I still been a smoker. My wife loves tattoos and hates cigarettes. Also, I'm attempting my 1st full marathon this Sunday.


TL;DR: I picked a date, didn't tell anyone. Smoked *a lot* leading up to the quit date, bottled the feeling of nausea for later reference. Then on quit date got a tattoo commemorating my decision, which sealed the deal. Chewed nicotine gum for a bit to ease the transition.


*edit* grammar""What worked for me is I made a rule that I could never ever have a pack (or individual) inside my house (I don't have the opportunity to store any at work and I don't smoke in my car, so effectively this meant I could never own a pack).  The only way I could smoke then was bumming from friends or paying the bathroom guy a buck for a cig out at the bar.  So I would still smoke occasionally, but you don't want to bum from your friends for long, and you don't go out drinking every night.

I smoked the most in my garage when I got stressed at home.  I was in college at the time so finals weeks or gaming with room mates were huge triggers for smoking a ton.  Not having a pack in the house eliminated that, and got me to a point where I rarely smoke now.  I'll still have a cig or two on some nights when I go out, but it's maybe twice a month at the most, and for me that works and I'm ok with it.""I switched to chantex plus e-cig plus chew. Then stopped the chantex, followed by the e-cig. I still chew occasionally. One tin usually lasts me a month. Better than the 1.5 to 2 packs a day I was at. ""Persistence. I agree cold turkey is what really works but don't think you are going to get it right he first time. I tried to quit 40 or 50 times before I got it right. Some attempts lasted a few hours, others a days, some weeks, some lasted a few months. I once quit for 15 months but then started smoking again. I finally quit because smoking had taken over my life. I've now quit for 16 years. Keep trying!""smoked for 15 years and quit cold turkey, i wasn't feeling very well and the cigs were tasting nasty with the cold i had. So i guess i was just sick of feeling even worse with common colds idk lol"Honestly marijuana was the easiest way for me. Cigarettes weren't nearly as good when I was high and cold turkey never really worked for me. To make a long story short eventually it had been 2 months since I smoked a cigarette and by then I couldn't stand the smell or taste of one."The patch, and really wanting to quit.""My maternal father and I both quit at the same time. About 2 weeks in he started smoking again. I went over to visit one day and he told me ""you'll never quit"". It's been 6 years this month..."I had to surround myself with people who didn't smoke.

But switch to tobacco snuff. Like, the kind that goes up your nose. Specifically, the lime flavor works the best.

Anywho, if your a normal person you probably wont like having to sniff ground tabacco to get your nicotine fix. So youll only do it when you need it, and eventually you just do less and less and less and your like, nah I don't think I need to put anything up my nose today.""I used to always joke, ""Quitting is easy! I've done it hundreds of times!"" But what finally got me to give it up for good was having a kid. It's been almost 3 years now since the birth of my first son and I've never so much as had a single puff. (I obviously realize this isn't much help to many of you!)""I smoked a pack a day or more for about 6 or 7 years. I tried to quit a few times, but what eventually worked was taking a few cigarettes out of the pack each time and throwing them away. One at first, then two, then three, etc.

After I got down to about 10 in a pack, meaning I had cut my intake in half, I started smoking only when I drank. 

One big tip: don't beat yourself up over a ""relapse."" It will happen. And each time you can remind yourself that this isn't what you want to do. Gradually the addiction weakens.

Another thing which helped is I had a coworker who would let me pay him for cigarettes. I think I did this during my ""drinking only"" phase. If I wanted to smoke at work, I gave him 50 cents or a dollar or whatever. 

Haven't smoked in like 6 years or so I think. I lost track. No desire whatsoever at this point. "Ecigs worked fine for me but then again...I work at an ecig shop lol"I smoked for 20 years. 

Unlearn the lies. Smoking isn't sexy, tasty, cool, relaxing, soothing, stress reliving. Blah blah blah. 

It stinks, hurts, tastes like shit and is killing you. Figure out your triggers and stressors, anticipate them. I was a RRT, I remember the smoke break. I have kept that break, I just lost the cigarettes.

Also, you didn't fail at quitting smoking, you quit for a while. Every reduction is a success, every cigarette not smoked is a victory.

It really is about your perceptions and habits. Both are very hard to change. You are not weak because you failed, you instead have learned more about your habit. Try again. It is just like learning anything, you will keep failing at it until you don't. It is worth it.

I quit 5 years ago, I can smoke a cigarette today and it grosses me out, I put it out and don't crave them. How the hell did I smoke 160,000+ of those nasty things? I programmed myself to do it. It is a learned habit. You can unlearn it, but the fundamental assumptions have to be challenged.

Being smoke free is one of my favorite things I have done for myself. I love it. Not being R J Morris's slave rules.

Now, get back to learning how to not smoke, you got this.""One day, I just stopped smoking. I know that's not that easy for some people, but I simply found other things to fill my time until I was too busy and just forgot to smoke a cigarette. I was working a lot, hanging out with friends (who DIDN'T smoke, big help), and I just was so full of stuff to do that by the time I did have time for a smoke, I was too tired and just wanted to go to bed.  Seriously FUCK smoking and FUCK anyone who thinks they can't quit because you're WRONG AS FUCK. Smoking is a big. fat. SCAM. It's the biggest scam that has ever been. 

1. Get you hooked by making it look ""cool""
2. You become addicted to something that tastes and smells like ass
3. You taste and smell like ass
4. You continue to SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT SMELLS AND TASTES LIKE ASS
5. They profit and you die. 

QUIT BEING A DUMBASS AND STOP SMOKING YOU MORON .""I decided to quit more than five years before I actually quit.  I told myself, ""You can't be a 40-year-old smoker, that's when shit starts going downhill"" when I was about 35 and thought I'd be smoking until I died.

Every year that passed, I'd have it in the back of my mind, ""You're going to be a nonsmoker in a couple of years, enjoy it while you can!""

Then the fateful year arrived.  Then the last month.  But I'd been getting ready for ages, you see?  Everyone knew I was going to be a nonsmoker, even me.  I'd prepared some of those Nicorette things for the cravings.

So when I put that last cigarette out I was well prepared.  There was never any real doubt.  I haven't had one since, even though I still love the smell, and miss the rush...best of luck to you OP.""I quit cold turkey time to time. Smoke for a few weeks then not the next. Your body gets used to the ups and downs and forgets about needing it and just enjoying it. 

Maybe I'm not addicted yet (been smoking for ~5 years) never been more than 1/2 a pack in a day unless going to a show or drinking a lot. Usually have 4-5 of them a day.

Am I just weird or do other people ""want"" them and not feel physically addicted? I'm mentally addicted to the relaxation 100% though, when I'm stressed one thing is for sure: I need a damn cig.  ""This is a shitty answer but is the truth : I got a concision. Out of nowhere I fainted (assuming this was blood sugar related) and I hit my head bad. I quit with in a week of that. Cigarettes just tasted gross afterwards. I also quit drinking in excess post concussion. Probably dangerous, but worth it.""I caught a really bad stomach virus that had me bed ridden for 3 days. During this time I wasn't able to smoke. I had always heard that the hardest part of quitting is the first few days, so I thought since I had already made it that far, I would see if I could make it further. I actually quit cold turkey this way.""I got hospitalized and was very sick for a week. I couldn't get up or go anywhere. To my surprise I actually never thought about smoking the entire time. I guess it was because of the pain or something like that.

I after I hadn't smoked for a week and when a doctor asked me if I smoked that was when I realized that I hadn't smoked the entire time I was there and yes I suddently felt the urge to smoke but to my surprise I told the doctor that I was no longer a smoker. And I actually have never smoked since then.

And the best part about not being a smoker anymore is that my son doesn't remember me being a smoker and he really looks up to me. (c;""I was in prison and smoking regularly; At my parole hearing they told me they'd let me out if I completed a drug program. I went into the drug program the same day and knew I couldn't get away with any shenanigans. I quit February 19th of last year, got out in November, haven't smoked or drank at all.

EDIT: cold turkey.""I gradually reduced my consumption from full, half, etc. over time I just didn't care for it much anymore. ""Fucken nothing!!! 
Insanity wolf yourself into the abyss of no smoking!!!!!!""Pure unadulterated will power. You have to make the decision to do it and stick to it. Nothing else works, you have to visualize a healthier life and follow through. "Scuba certification did it for me.  The first few times diving I focused so much on my breathing.  I really noticed how heavy it was which in turn meant sucking down the air and having to go up much faster than anyone else. This was the deciding factor and I just quit cold turkey.  I also stopped drinking for a while so that I didn't want the smoke with booze."[This is one of the powerful anti-ad video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO0qwl5k9R4)

No..evidently it didn't stop me.. :( but gotta admit that it touched me.


Maybe If I experience it firsthand..want to feel it like being without agenda or manipulation.""What worked for me:

* Give up when you get ill. Rather than having a 'last cigarette' i gave up when I got a chest infection and couldn't smoke for a few days, and a friend mentioned that since i hadn't smoked for a few days, why start again? Giving up by not realising you started to give up was a good way to go, and when you can;t smoke because you would cough for 10 mins it is easier to stop yourself lighting up. 
* Cold turkey - the easy bit of getting off cigarettes is the nicotine, the social part is much harder. Why make this go on longer with patches, sprays with e-cigs?
* Do it when you want to. You can't be forced or cajoled, you have to actually be personally committed. ""I bought a new car.  

95% of the cigarettes I smoked were while in transit, and I didn't want my new car to smell or have little burn marks.  ""Stopped smoking by starting dipping.

Not the ideal way to do it...""I smoked my brother's preferred blend (Reds) instead of my 27's, and thought it tasted disgusting. That's when I realized: fuck, dude ALL cigarettes are disgusting. I was tricking myself into actually thinking one tasted better than the other. They're just all gross to me ever since then. It's gross to think about now, and smelling someone else's smoke makes me nauseous. Just had an eye opener, I guess.

I'll have a cigar maybe once a month, but I used to be a chain smoker, and have only smoked once since Thanksgiving. 

""I smoked for about 6 years before this occurred.

I got a stomach virus and was really nauseated for a while...I couldn't even smell the smoke without wanting to vomit. I didn't have a cigarette for about 2 weeks because of this. After that I figured I could make it to 1 month...then 2, 3...eventually the cravings subsided. It's been almost 3 years since I've quit.

Far too often, people lie to themselves.
You have to really want to quit...when you have the resolve, set short goals and commit to them. Good luck! ""Well im currently about 9 days in Cold turkey and well so far so good. First three days were fucked. Also I still cant sleep a solid night but im over the intense cravings.

I guess genuinely wanting  to quit is the biggest motivation.""Smoked for a few years, then just decided it was gross and not doing anything for me so I just stopped."I decided to stop smoking so I stopped. "After 5 times I have to ask if you actually want to quit? Seriously, being nagged into it by someone else isn't the incentive that will make you stop, without making the decision yourself you will (almost) always fail.

1) You need to *REALLY* want to give up. The catalyst for me was my son, then 2 years old, had developed a cough because I was smoking. At that point massive guilt made the decision for me.

2) Just stop. Don't ""cut down a bit"" don't replace cigarettes with something else like a patch, just stop. Two weeks of hell followed by a lifetime of 'meh..' It really is that simple.

3) Give yourself a tangible reward. Every morning take the cash you would have used to buy cigarettes and drop it in a big jar, you'll be amazed at how quickly it mounts up. Once you can actually see the reward for quitting you can start planning how many more smoke free days until [insert reward here] Could be a holiday, could be a new TV, if you're a heavy smoker it could be a new car. A good friend of mine followed this advice and after 4 months took his wife to Japan for a three week vacation.

20+ years a non-smoker now and I've never wanted to start again.""kinda like you don't ween yourself off of heroin, you don't ween yourself off smoking. cold turkey is the best way.""I quit smoking. Smoked from 14 to 21 woke up one day, realized I didn't want cancer so I threw a half pack away and haven't smoked since. Just quit smoking, you don't need to spend money on a bunch of bullshit, just have self control, and take responsibility for yourself. ""I've tried almost everything to quit, but I didn't like the cold turkey process. So I tried chantix, which worked really well. It allowed me to ween off and at the same time contemplate why I was smoking. I was also a heavy non-filter smoker.""For me, i decided to give up smoking for lent. I bought a 5lb bag of dum-dums because i wanted to try that method out. So whenever i had a craving i just grabbed a lollipop. This worked for a while until my teeth and gums felt sore and i felt like i was getting cavities (~2 weeks). After that i started smoking again but noticed i didnt have as many cravings as before. Around October of 2012, i was introduced to vaping by a friend and i picked up one for myself which, i feel, finally helped me kick the habit. I havent had a real cigarette since then.
Tl;dr: dum-dums and vaping ""I used an e-cig to kick the tobacco habbit. Six months later I decided I was over being a slave to nicotine and decided to go cold turkey. I locked myself in my room over memorial day weekend and proceeded to be the biggest douchey dick in the history of mankind. The simple realization that nicotine could have that much of an affect on my personality has made me not want to go back. The want never fully goes away, to this day if I catch whiff of my favorite brand I have a fleeding thought of tackeling said person and smoking that damn thing to the filter. ""I had 3 failed quits after about 7 months. Always hoped that I could be one of those people that smoke when they drink. Inevitably led back to me smoking. I have used the patch several times and it really helped me get past the jonesing. I'm almost to 2 years smoke free now. The difference this time is that I just decided I was done. No cheating smokes. No electronic smokes. Nearly 2 years later and I don't even think about smoking, and I smoked for 20 years. Good luck!""Cold turkey, but cold turkey NOW. Not tomorrow or next week. I see people saying they set a date but I definitely couldn't have done it that way because I would have always put it off. Try not to think about how this will be the last cigarette you ever smoke. Just think about today. Today you will not smoke. Then tomorrow will be today and you worry about not smoking again. 

You can't avoid work obviously so do something instead when you take a break like get some water from the cooler or whatever. But definitely avoid alcohol for a very long time if you are truly serious about quitting because you WILL smoke when you drink (I would even usually just buy a whole pack and be left to smoke it and then I would tell myself I would ""quit after this pack""). 

If you slip up and smoke (which you probably will) don't think of it as a failure where you have to start all over but just realize that it is a process and don't start smoking again thinking it is a lost cause. Just focus on not smoking the next cigarette. 

Also I find counting the days counterproductive because, while it does give you something to feel good about (""It's been 3 weeks, pretty good, right?""), it will give you something to feel bad about if you slip up and make you feel as if you are starting over which isn't the case at all. It also makes you focus o smoking in a roundabout way because you are thinking about the days that you have gone without smoking.

Oh, and exercise and don't keep cigarettes around. Toss 'em.. But there's no ""solution."" You know what you have to do: you have to quit. It's just really, really hard. It's all about when you convince yourself that ""Fuck it, I'll have one"" and then talk yourself back off the ledge.

Try to remember how utterly disgusting and unhealthy that shit is. The effects are immediate too, not just ""cancer when you're 70."" You can't breathe for shit and because of that you're probably out of shape (unless you're one of these freaks I see every now and then). 

There are no tricks. Just rough times ahead that you already know will be worth it.""I used Chantix.  But, I feel the more important part was getting the mindset that you can never have another cigarette again in your life.  I also accepted that fact that if I continued to smoke it was going to kill me sooner than anything else in my life.""Not me, but Mom. She quit cold turkey after her doc told her she had early stages of emphysema. Smoking 2-3 packs/day for 50yrs had finally caught up to her. This was 10yrs ago. She beat breast cancer a few years ago only to succumb to lung cancer last year. The last 6mo of her life  were a nightmare. I had moved her in with my wife and I because she could no longer live on her own. Any physical exertion caused her to gasp for air, including getting out of bed to sit on her portable toilet that was 1ft away. Now anytime I see a young person smoking I think to myself, ""WTF are you doing stufa(stupid fuck)""""Went to Afghanistan where butts were 4 dollars a carton. When I got home tax brought Newports to $10.30 a pack. Fuck that, I don't need to smoke that bad.  I don't get how homeless people and drug addicts can afford to smoke these days."I have stopped after using nicotine lozenges. Chewing them has replaced the 'need to do something' as well as providing nicotine.Personally an E-cig worked for me. I don't know if you can consider that quitting since you still have a nicotine habit as long as you keep using the E-cig but it's definitely a hell of a lot better for your health than cigarettes.Some Columbian nose-candy"Cold turkey, and a reason, you have to want it, I smoked for damn near ten years and decided I was DONE and I smoked my last cig and spent the next three weeks in hell on earth, there is no sugar coating here it sucks, however I've been smoke free for almost three years now, would not change for the world, I can breathe, I don't get sick hardly at all, it's amazing, but you need that reason, for me I wanted better for myself, and then about six months in I met the love of my life who is deathly allergic to cigarette smoke, so that helps a little bit lol""Snus dude. Snus is the shit. Go and fetch in Sweden, it will work wonders for you."The recent bouts of cold weather in the Midwest have beaten the urge to smoke for me."wife said stop, or I will divorce you.""The Patch.  Follow the instructions. Do not leave it on when you sleep. Drink TONS of water. 

Do step 1 until you think it's time to take it down to step 2 (Should be maybe 1-3 weeks).  If you go to step 2 and need to go back to step 1, no worries, take your time.  

Go down to step 3 once you feel you are ready (Should be 4-7 weeks), and again take your time.  Here is where you have all the time in the world.  By this time you should be out of the habit of having a smoke after meals, while drinking coffee, while drinking alcohol, after smoking a joint, etc.  Stay on step 3 for as long as you feel comfortable.  If you take it off for a couple days and feel that you are having cravings, put that shit back on.  Ween yourself off of it.

I am not saying this will work for everyone, but it definitely worked for me.""Cold turkey by far is the best way. After a couple weeks the Nicotine has left your system and the cravings are pretty much gone.

But for me what worked, I got an e-cig (the one you fill up with liquid), had nicotine for one week, then I got one that was a shisha flavour (0mg nicotine) used that for a few months, then just wasnt bothered to smoke in general. Been off for ages now, a few friends of mine have had the same work for them"Chest pain + cold turkey.  Smoked 1.5 packs for about 10 yrs."Three bouts of pneumonia in one winter. Could barely eat and breathe (was panting more than breathing), and the ER still just shrugged and sent me home that one night I began hallucinating while puking lung-phlegm into the toilet bowl. Figured I'd better do something about it since nobody else would, and its easy enough to quit smoking once breathing turns into panting.   
The only trick I've needed was one that could help me deal with the typical social habits of a smoker, luckily I'd just started at a place where I was the only smoker which suddenly made those smoke breaks really antisocial - I replaced smoke breaks and 'the motions' with water bottle refill breaks and group excursions to the water fountain - I sip from the bottle just like I'd take a drag from a smoke, and with the same frequency (apparently my constant cap-removing and replacing on the water bottle has completely filled the gap left by cigarettes and can annoy my surroundings just the same).""Nicotine Lozenges.  Walgreens has them ~25% cheaper than Nicorette brand.

I can control my own dosage, taking them after a meal or when I'm stressed.  It's a very similar experience to using snus tobacco.

Nowadays I maybe have 1 smoke a week and afterwards I feel shitty and go back to the lozenges.  I might have 2 smokes during a party like new years.

I haven't kicked the addiction, I've just replaced it with something less cancerous.  Been like this for almost 6 months."I decided I would rather play soccer than smoke. My SO was also pretty upset that I started again and making her cry isn't a top priority of mine. Cold turkey worked for me. I would do some push ups every time I wanted a smoke. Worked well.Chantix. Smoker for 10+ years and have quit for 6 years."I quit 4 years ago, did it cold turkey. Was a pack and half a day smoker got 11 years. I would say that you have to want to not smoke any more. You cant think of it as ""Quiting"". And if its work that making it hard for you than take a No Smoking holiday. Take a couple days off and quit the night before your days off. The first 3 days are the hardest I found. I coudnt concentrate. What ever you do, just remember, ""It gets easier everyday"". Good Luck""Cold turkey.

I had an epiphany about how terrible smoking actually was for me after walking up my stairs and being completely out of breath (at the time I was 19, 6'3"", and 165 lbs). so I decided right then and there that the cigs I had were my last (despite it not being a full pack). It's been almost 4 years now since I had a cigarette.

After many failed attempts (and watching my friends repeatedly fail to quit) I've realized that you can't quit by convincing yourself that you want to; you actually have to want to quit. That means you can't make excuses like ""I'll only smoke when I'm drunk"", or ""I won't buy anymore packs"", because eventually you **will** start smoking again. 

I would suggest sitting down and really think about whether you want to quit or not. If you decide you're ready to quit then pick a day that you're going to stop and commit to it, no excuses."I used electronic cigarettes. I haven't smoked in 6 months. Vaping may not be FDA approved but since I started I can run and exercise like I had never smoked."as \u\kirkirus said, going cold turkey is the best way.  To combat the urges I played guitar.  I rarely have before, and never have since, but for 3 days or so whenever I got urges I would play till my fingers hurt.  Find something creative to do to get away from that feeling in your gut.  Eat good, stay with friends, and in a couple days it will pass.  Best of luck to you buddy!   (Also I had quit the job I smoked at before so that was a huge help to me - but im sure you'll find a way.)""New friends, new habits. I quit over the course of several years, and it only really stuck when I found myself in an active, non-smoking social circle. If you find you just can't quit, chances are it's because your friends smoke or see you as a smoker.

Was a smoker for 7-8yrs. Boyfriend of 2yrs doesn't smoke and after a while he stopped asking me to quit. This made me both disappointed in myself and made me feel like he gave up hoping I would quit.

I never ""tried"" to quit.  I smoked with conviction and promised when I did finally attempt to quit I would succeed.  I then gloated that it was going to be super easy to quit to all my friend and co-workers.  All this raised the stakes really really high for the day I would finally quit.

When I decieded to, because my son was on his way, I ordered some champix and pulled out all that gloating, and quit.  It's been just over 2 years and I don't feel like smoking.  If I had known it was going to be that easy I would have quit 10 years earlier.

I tried setting a date where I'd be stress free and have days off work etc. Failed.

I decided to quit when during finals week of college while working full time and taking 4 classes. It sucked, but I think the fact that I was so stressed and busy actually helped. 

Also, when I got the urge to smoke I took a nice swig of water and mentally reminded myself 'this urge will pass in a few seconds, not worth giving in. I have this urge 50 times a day but for only a few seconds at a time, don't be a bitch and give in.' and the urge passed a few seconds later. I believe the 1 week mark is when the physical cravings were gone, after that it was breaking the habits of wanting to smoke after eating, while driving etc. Those are much easier habits to break than the first week of physical cravings. Good luck.""I attached my quitting date with something VERY important (i.e. My wedding day) and stuck with the patch all the way until it said to. 

A lot of people who use the patch, after a few weeks of not smoking, say they're fine now. They stop using the patch and within 2 days they're smoking again. 

Also, replace the smoking with something else. For me it was video games. I started playing a LOT more when I quit. I still find tat when I'm playing games, I don't even think of smoking (or drinking booze for that matter). It doesn't work as well with laid back games like WoW though :p"Take up running.  "There is already some really good advice shared by a lot of people. Here is mine:

Remind yourself you have to be tough to quit, that nicotine is more addictive than heroin. When the cravings come, remind yourself you have to be strong to get through them.

Lung cancer usually gets people to quit and death is a surefire way to quit. So you will eventually quit. But tell yourself you should quit short of lung cancer and death.

1. Realize you have the right to smoke if you want to. You also have the right to quit. You need to decide to quit taking your life and start saving your life. 
2. Realize it is you who failed the first five attempts. Don't feel sad about it but do beat yourself up. You failed. You were the problem. Not the stress around you. It was you.
3. Don't do what you did the first five times. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome. Be sane about quitting.
4. Stop using nicotine. No patches, no inhalers, no e-cigs. Quit cold turkey and don't look back. Nicotine replacement is a scam. It's like overweight people replacing sugar with powdered sugar. 
5. When the cravings come, embrace them. Count how long each lasts. Never believe ""it is never going to end"". Time it. It ends. Eventually the cravings last shorter periods and occur further apart.
6. Exercise. Take walks. Relax. Love life. 
 
Think of something to look forward to if you remain smoke free for a week, a month, a year. Reward yourself. Seriously, if you can do it, you deserve it. You are awesome.

This advice is coming from someone who smoked 30 years and was able to quit. I wish you and everyone else trying to quit the best of luck. ""You have to WANT to quit. Really want to. For years, I told myself I should quit, but really I enjoyed it too much. The habits. 2 failed attempts with gum, patches. It took one winter of constant bronchial infections to finally, truly want to quit. Just went cold turkey, and now I can't even stand second hand smoke."">what ACTUALLY WORKED to get you to successfully stop smoking?

I stopped putting cigarettes in my mouth and lighting them up.  ""I quit cold turkey 19 years ago. I quit cold turkey and never missed them. I never had even one craving after smoking for 18 years. I was a two pack a day smoker when I quit.

The thing most people never tell you about smoking is that there are two parts to the addiction. The physical addiction to nicotine is easy to beat. Don't smoke for about 48 hours and it's pretty much gone. The hard part is the mental addiction. You get addicted to the routine of the that first cigarette right after you wake up, the one after you eat, the one you smoke when you're stressed, etc. The way to beat it is with mental warfare.

There are things people will tell you that you probably have rejected because of the cruelty behind the words. Accept all of this and believe it's true because this is your weapon for winning.

1. You stink. The odor coming off  your body is offensive at best. Even if you only smoke outside the tar from the cigarettes is coating your body and you smell bad. Non-smokers don't even want to be in an elevator with you because of how bad you smell. The tar is coating your clothes, your skin, and your hair and you transfer it to everything you come in contact with. You're gross.
2. You're weak. You let cigarettes dictate what you do and when you do it. You can't just go anywhere on the spur of the moment. You have to have a cigarette first. There are places you'll avoid going because you can't smoke easily. You let cigarettes tell you how to live your life.
3. You're inconsiderate. You hold up everyone while they wait for you to smoke your cigarette. You expose family to the smoke and tar, making them smell your stink and poison.
4. Cigarettes are dirty. If you smoke in your car look at all of the ash and sticky tar that's collecting all over your car. Wipe down the windshield and look at all that brown nasty tar. Look around your house at the brown stains on your walls, ceilings, and curtains. Now think about all of this brown, nasty, sticky tar being on your clothes, your skin, your hair, and in your lungs. Every breath your exhale contains some of that brown stickiness too. It is so absolutely gross. You are disgustingly gross, filthy, and dirty.

The only way you are going to get clean is to put down the cigarettes and never pick them up again. You need to hate them and hate the control they have over you. Throw them away and take control over you life.

If you need stories about people who have died from lung cancer I have those too. Two of my families member died in the past year from lung cancer caused by smoking. It's one of the worst ways you can die. Lung cancer is almost always environmental and the number one cause is smoking. As someone who smoked for 18 years and averaged 1-2 packs a day during that 18 year period, I now have to live with the fact that I'm high risk for lung cancer because I was too stupid to quit when I was younger.""I've only smoked for about 5 years so I think it was easier for me than say a 40 year old. But for me it wasn't as hard as everyone says because I wanted to quit. I mean every smoker thinks they want to quit and they do a little bit, but they would rather keep smoking. I just had a daughter and I knew I had to be a role model. I also couldn't afford them anymore. Another big reason I wanted to quit, I was tired of being a slave to cigarettes. Every hour I needed one, I can't smoke inside anywhere, and people just don't think it's cool anymore. 

As for how I quit, cold turkey. ""Honestly, I feel I got lucky. I use to be a heavy smoker. I just got tired of the taste after awhile, it didn't really phase me. So I stopped cold turkey."Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking."Combination of exercise & e-cigs.  I signed up for Crossfit to get in shape, and after my first class, I went home, threw my cigarettes away, and haven't had one since.  After that workout I felt like I was going to die from not being able to breathe.  I knew I couldn't work out AND smoke real cigarettes, so it was no longer an option.

That afternoon I bought the cheap NJoy ecigs from 7-11, and those got me through the next couple of weeks. I smoked the ecig much less than the regular cigarettes.  After a couple of weeks, I quit the ecig with no problem.

Before that I had tried EVERYTHING:
* patches (full course of Nicoderm 2x):  I smoked again withing weeks of finishing each course
* Chantix: I didn't have the wacky side effects, but it hurt my stomach horribly
* Wellbutrin:  Made me have suicidal thoughts
* cold turkey: lasted until one of my smoking buddies wanted company or until I got stressed at work
* gum:  too gross to actually chew""I've quit smoking 3 times:

1. After smoking for 6 years, I made a new years resolution to quit smoking. At midnight I finished a cigarette and gave the rest of my pack to a friend. I was an asshole for about a week and didn't have a cigarette for 3 years.

2. After thinking ""I can just have an occasional one and be okay"" I started up again. It quickly escalated to a full time habit again. I ended up using nicotine ""mints"" to quit this time.  It took much longer and I was an asshole for closer to a month this time. I was cigarette free for a year.

3. Started up again after during a very dark time in my life which I won't go into here. Four years later, I was on a hike with my 3 year old sun. We were having a great time, and I was struggling getting up a hill.  As he was (literally) running in circles around me I decided that I wanted the be around as long as possible and do as much as I could with him. I mentally prepared myself (read procrastinated) and had my last cigarette about a month after that. This was three years ago and my asshole period was a little over 2 weeks this time.

Things that I've noticed:

* I enjoyed smoking. I still miss it on some level and still have cravings at times. Due to this, I consider myself to be a non-practicing smoker.
* The withdrawal period was harder to get through on each subsequent  attempt.
* I'm not sure if it is because I'm older or not, but it seems that I have lost a measure of my patience each time I've quit.

Quitting is completely a focus of will. It is one of the hardest to get through due to the length of time your will needs to be applied. It will suck.  You will be pissed off.  You will try to rationalize have ""just one to take the edge off"". You will take this stress out on those around you (please warn them, they'll appreciate it). You become your own adversary.

You can get through it. You **will** get through it. No more half-hearted attempts because it is something you should do.  Do it because it is something you want to do.

There are alternatives to lighting up at work.  Step out and take a lap around the parking lot, do some push ups / sit ups, strangle a co-worker (I would avoid that last one). Just try to distract yourself as the craving passes.

Good luck OP. Let us know how it works out."Hypnosis.You could be like my dad and have a heart attack. He has to have triple bypass open heart surgery sometime in the next week or so. Don't smoke and eat your veggies."Wife got pregnant and to support her, quit the day we found out. I used patches and that definitely helped ... 5+ years later I could still have a smoke and love it, sometimes it makes my mouth water. I've only had one smoke since and i got super sick from it and keep that in my mind.

Tldr; get a lady friend preggo""Cold Turkey ... I've always thought that if you need help to quit smoking (patch, pills, etc...), you aren't REALLY ready to quit ... I realize everyone is different, but this is just my opinion...""I moved to Alaska.  If the price doesn't do it, the cold certainly will.""Smoker for 7 years. My story may differ from others. I have this strange, almost obsession with panicking at the first sign of getting a cold. One day I felt a cold coming on and decided to see how long I could go without having a cigarette since I always felt smoking made me more sick. Before I knew it I hadn't lit up in 24 hours which was the first time since I started smoking since I had done that. So I decided to see if I could do 36 the 48 hours. By the time I reached 60 hours I couldn't believe it. While I still felt like dick and still got sick, I wasn't worried. That is until I had to go back to work. I too know the pressures of being at work and coworkers smoking. (75% of my coworkers smoke.) I kindly told everyone my accomplishments and asked them if they would refrain from invited me out to smoke. 
Well I got shit faced one night at a Halloween party about 3 weeks later, bummed a Newpwort 100 and proceeded to puke all over my pirate wig. I wanted to kill myself for letting myself down. I got so depressed that I would not let myself drink for 2 months for fear of it happening again. 
Moral of the story, for myself at least, going cold turkey is what worked best for me. My obsession with not getting sick always played a pivotal role and embarrassing myself by puking on my costume all played a helping hand in me quitting. I have 15 months clean and couldn't be happier. As others have stated, if you don't want to quit you will never go through with it. "I was a professional smoker for 15 years. My Dr. at the time gave me a great tip rather than patches or gum do both. Use patches to keep a nice level of nicotine in the blood and then use the gum when you feel you need a tab. I went from 60 a day to zero and its never bothered me since. Took me a few weeks to taper down the gum (which I became addicted too) but got their in the endAquire a girlfriend that doesn't like smoking. "A real, professional-grade, electronic cigarette. I slowly tapered down the nicotine in the 'juice' until it was gone.

I still get the feeling to smoke occasionally but smelling it once makes that craving go away!

It's unbelievable...but they work!""I just started judgmentally thinking about other smokers until I was too embarrassed by my own habit, that I stopped.  I still see myself as a flawed person and allow myself to slip a few times a year and have one.  But at this point, smoking isnt enjoyable. My throat tightens up, and I dont get the momentary rush that I used to.  

Also I would rather have the money I spent on the stupid habit.  that shit adds up so fast.  a pack a day smokers are now throwing away like $4k a year.  I cant imagine that shit.  I am too broke.

Stop being a pussy about it and quit already.  All you smokers are the same.  Filthy and mentally flawed individuals.  Straighten your shit out.  I miss being one of you though, and love you anyways.""Visual representations can work very well! Say you pay $7 for a pack a day, every day put $7 in a drawer/envelope or whatever, at the end of one week look at the stack of cash! It can be very encouraging. In some cases that could be enough for a gym membership, that new xbox or ps game, or actually being able to pay bills on time!

Im a very visual learning kind of person, this helped me when I quit the first time! Thank you for this thread, im going out to get some patches to quit again.""I smoked heavily for three years until one day I realized I don't want to die of lung cancer or heart disease, so I stopped smoking.

I'll have a cigarette when I'm really drunk every three or four months, but it's only one and the terrible taste overrides the nicotine buzz.""Prison. Even though there was an abundance of roll em up tobacco in prison, it was expensive. 1 to 2 dollars per rollie. Also when we could go to our smoking area (the nasty shitty smelling bathrooms, the guards tried to stay far away) there would be a bunch of scavengers.

Scavengers were guys would live in the bathroom and beg to smoke with you and plead for just a hit. Since there were so many people with all kinds of diseases (herpes, hepatitis, hiv) I refused to share my cigarettes with anyone. So I frequently was threatened and called uppity, racist, cheap, asshole...etc

Finally I got caught with a bunch of tobacco and lost 15 days of my earned good time, meaning I'd have to spend an additional two weeks in prison.

So with all that bullshit and stress I gave it up. I tapered off, getting down to just two cigs a day. Then I quit completely, I felt really bad. Didn't get off my bunk for anything for a few days and it took about two weeks for the crappy feelings to go away. The cravings lasted for months, about a year. The craving would be worst when I'd smell tobacco smoke in the air. But I grew to hate the smell years later. And I still do, I can't be around cigarette smoke it bothers me. Ive tried smoking twice since I quit, and both times made me very nauseous and I had to lay down for hours.

P.S. The tobacco was usually smuggled in someone's prison pocket, aka anus.

P.S.S. When I got out of prison the ridiculous price of cigarettes kept me from picking up that habit again. 

"I quit cold turkey and was convinced that cigarettes were just disgusting.  After that I didn't have the urge.  I know this wouldn't work for 99% of people but it worked for me.Zyban and the patch."I was really hoping I would come here and find some amazing way to quit smoking and all the top comments are talking about quitting cold turkey with sheer will power. God damnit, I don't have that :(""For me it took a change of setting. I haven't smoked in 5 years now and I can honestly say that cold turkey works. I was living at home with my brother who smoked, and when I moved into the dorm at my university I decided it was a great time to quit because it would be less convenient and those around me didn't smoke. I threw up very meal for the next 4-5 months but it was totally worth it! Hope you can kick it.

In the middle of a particularly strong acid trip I was smoking and realized how terrible it tasted, how expensive it was and how bad it smelled.  I put down the cigarette I was smoking, gave the rest of my pack to a friend, and have never ever looked back.  I've never even had a a small urge to smoke again."I started chewing tobacco... God I fail "cold turkey, quit hanging around people that smoke, it helps if your smoking friends quit with you.

I had 2 friends in my regular group of 4 friends that I smoked with, we all quit together, they started up again shortly after. The 1 friend who didn't smoke wanted to help me so he found something we were both interested in and when my other friends went out to smoke, he would talk about that 1 thing with me. It's worked so far and we have a shared interest. He's a really good friend.""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. Go check it out, it may change your life."After 25 years of smoking I simply read a book: Easy Way by Alan Carr. I immediately quit and haven't had so much as a puff since. Been about five years now.I fell in love with someone who is allergic to smoke. Quit cold turkey and never looked back. Been 6 years almost."Chantix.  My wife and I quit at the same time,   she got some pretty nasty side effects, but I didn't get any of them.

* Using nicotine gum while smoking my regular amount. Took away the reward, left only the yuck.
* Trying many times. Practice makes perfect.
* The ban on smoking in bars and eateries. Took away the social pressure.
* Burying my mother in law (emphysema), and noticing that the smokers at the funeral looked 20 years older than the non-smokers, despite being the same actual age."I just quit... tired of spending all that money"ok rare situation here, but if you can get into it it will work:

started up the W. Ridge of Mt Forbidden as a 1/4-1/2 pack a day smoker.  Partner chained smoked the climb.  He got stoned at the top and began to have a panic-attack about repelling and down-climbing.  This helped to push two other strangers (also on the summit) into panic. 
Three panicked climbers and me began the repels.  My partner continued to chain smoke as I nursemaided three people off the mountain, setting up all the raps and getting them in and out.  By the time we got to the bottom I associated cigarette smoke with fear and stress (it took a couple of hours)-- never smoked again."Ended up going on a prescription quit-smoking aid called Bupropion (Wellbutrin). Literally made cigarettes taste like garbage. Couldn't smoke again without that awful taste (and bad stomach ache). It basically makes cigarettes extremely aversive. "I went cold turkey.  Yes, it sucks, but my reasoning is this...from what I've read, nicotine only stays in your body for 2-3 days.  Once it's flushed, ALL of your cravings are psychological only.  So why keep putting nicotine in your body with the gums or the patches?  Get it out, and let it stay out.  To successfully quit you need to beat the psychological addiction anyway.  Which means you have to really want to quit.
As mealy mouthed as it may sound, the best advice I heard for quitting is the simplest advice: Whenever you want to have a cigarette...don't.  ""Cold turkey 2/2006 after 30+ years of pack-a-day.  There had been several previous attempts, which had all failed miserably.  This time was relatively easy because I actually *wanted* to stop.  I'd known for years that I *needed* to stop, but the difference between *need* and *want* made it happen.  It's an addiction and the addict has to want to quit.  The craving was minor, surprisingly.  However, the smell of tobacco smoke was like a siren's call to me for right on 6 months.  After that it was repulsive.  Side effect: weight gain.""I used Chantix. It worked like a charm for me and I didn't see any side effects. Mild nausea if I would take the pill in the morning before eating anything. Other than that, some odd dreams but nothing intense.

Being about my 6th time attempting to quit, for some reason I know this time I'm not going back.""Both of my parents just found something else to do every time they got the urge to smoke. For my dad, it was diet coke. For my mom, I think she ate a carrot or something like that. I don't really remember, it was so long ago. 

Point is, find *something else* to do instead. My dad put on a bit of weight as a result of using diet coke as a substitute, but it still worked and he's since lost the weight.""I quit by finally getting down to one per day, at the end of day after work. It helped that I had changed jobs to a workplace that didn't encourage the habit. I also did the patch for when I went out drinking. When I was at the bar and everyone was smoking and my willpower was about to break, I'd apply the patch. I didn't even finish the whole box. That was 10 years ago. I may have a cigarette maybe once a year in a social setting, but I find that I can walk away after the one. ""An electronic cigarette actually. I never got quite hooked on my E-cig like others do, but it was enough to keep me from wanting cigarettes. A few times I had smoked a cigarette in the middle of my E-cig usage and it tasted for awful and the smoke was too harsh. Naturally I just kind of forgot about my e-cig and now I am completely smoke free.""I used e-cig after a couple months with that it was easy to stop compared to a cigarette. 6 years of smoking now 6 months smoke free. I do however miss it, I loved smoking I just hated the way it made me feel afterward.""I know it'll be hard, but you can't go outside with those smokers anymore. I started taking my breaks downstairs alone. I quit 3 years ago. I used Zyban/Wellbutrin. Within 2 weeks the craving was gone. My social life has changed at work but it's for the best! :) smoke free and loving it!""I started smoking at 16, and was eventually smoking a pack and a half a day by the time I was 21. I literally needed a cigarette to catch my breath after coughing fits (I wish I was making that up). So after a few attempts to quit in vein, I picked a day, said I would smoke my last cigarette on that day, and that was that. Didn't even finish my last pack; there's one left in my room in case the world is ending ;)

But anyway, when people ask me how I quit, my go to response is a note taken from Yoda's book: ""Do, or do not. There is no try.""""My father in law is currently dying of stage 4 lung cancer, that was enough of a wake up call for my wife to quit smoking. Let's hope this time is the one that sticks."Being poor and doing a few push-ups when I craved a cigarette. "Former smoker and drug use here (inc heroin and coke). First, I can confirm that smoking was harder for me to quit than heroin. Although, the process was a lot less brutal. Second, to quit smoking, get into an enjoyable competitive sport with friends - mine was squash. After one session you will be robbed completely of your masculinity after your friends walk all over you. Third, take a weekend and an extra day or two off work. Make sure you have enough food at home to last you and simply lock yourself in without smokes. After the 3 or 4 days, the physical addition will be gone. Forth, you'll still get the psychological desire to smoke for quite a while, but just remember - you don't want to look like a pussy at the next squash session.

Regular sport also gives you a lot of positive reinforcement. You'll rapidly notice a vast improvement in your physical abilities - even things like walking up stairs and, more importantly, sex.

Tl;dr Get over the psychological addition of smoking by realising that smoking makes you a pussy."Just use aversion therapy. Start eating foods that you know will make you diarrhea when you smoke. Start driving terribly and crash when you smoke. Try fucking your life over just because you smoke. GG"I'm not recommending this, but it worked for me...

1/2 oz. of shrooms
couple buddies
pitchers of beer
at least 2-3 packs of smokes

consume as much of the above as possible in a reasonable amount of time.

When you are tripping balls and chainsmoking you may look at your cigarette and decide you no longer have any interest.

never smoke again.

true story, worked for me like 12 years ago.""Having the right mentality and actually truly wanting to quit helped me quit cold turkey. If you don't want to quit for yourself and without outside influence, you're not going to be successful in my opinion. I was tired of all the money I was wasting and how it was really hampering my fitness. ""Having a baby.  Realizing that my habit would be harmful for the kiddo, and not wanting her to grow up seeing me smoke, have me smell like smoke, etc.  For my wife it was the same thing, she'd tried to quite 2-3 times, but being pregnant was her ""cold turkey"" method.""The thing that helped me quit was realizing that my addiction would generate emotion to make me want to smoke.

Smoke when you're stressed --> quit smoking --> addiction generates unfounded feelings of stress to make you smoke.

Once I had the conscious realization that my body was generating this feeling in order to make me do something, I found it far easier to overcome.""It was e-cigs for me. Sure I'm still smoking those, but my quality of life and ability to breathe has improved dramatically. It took a year for me to make a full switch. It was slow, gradual, it helps that I live in a place where it's cold and sucks to go outside for a smoke at night. After the first 6 months I made an active effort to make habitual/mental connections I had with cigs to e-cigs as well. Smoking while drinking was the big one. I started only smoking e-cigs after taking a drink and just resisted the urge to light one up. Now that I've replaced and combined the same cig habits with ecigs I don't need the traditional kind anymore.   
It's all about those habits, sitting on a bench in a park, going for walks, drinking, with friends outside, after meals, those places you formed smoking habits around, those keep you addicted because of the familiarity. If you can replace those with a new habit (like the gum chewing thing) you can get yourself out much easier. Ecigs are a good way to start that because you still get your nicotine. Once you do that you can decrease the nic content in the vape juice and ween yourself off. It takes a while and you may still be smoking nic free vape, but at least you can satisfy the habit without chemical addiction and eventually stop. It takes a while, but that's what worked for me.  
I know you tried ecigs, but the habitual thing is essential to switching. Just puffing on it inside when you get a craving is not the same as going outside to your smoke spot and vapong up there instead of on your couch. "E-cigarettes. I'd smoked a PAD for 30 years and thought I'd give them a try.  I kept the cigarettes with me and every time I wanted a smoke I took a puff on the ecig first.  Sometimes I went ahead and smoked a cig but soon realised that the ecigs taste better.  After two weeks I was tobacco free - no will power needed."I believe that the e-cig is the best option for you.  Even though you have previously tried an ecig, I highly recommend checking out the ecig sub.  You can educate yourself into nicer and more effective ecigs there.  This would also be ideal for your trigger situation as it is legal to smoke an ecig inside. You might have to spend more money on a higher quality ecig, but in the long run you will save loads of money and live a much healthier life.  If you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask here.""What worked for me was to stay at home for about a month. No partying no nothing. I also drew a patern on my hand with a permanent marker. For every day I wrote a line. So whenever I was tempted for a cigarette, I looked at my hand and saw, how many days I got through without tobacco and how much effort would have gone out the window. And I've been clean now for a little short of four years and I couldn't be happier.""Fear of cancer.  I smoked (at least) 2 packs a day for years.  Quit cold turkey 28 years ago.  Now I drink too much...  Win some, lose some. :)""Cold turkey all the way. I have found that with myself and others that when I try to smoke ecigs or switch to gum or dip that I am holding on too hard to the nicotine. 

Cigs were my tobacco of choice and everything else just made me want them. I've seen people jump on the ecig bandwagon who spend MORE now than they did when they just smoked cigarettes. 

I read something profound on reddit when I picked them back up after 2 months: ""There is no such thing as one last cigarette."" You can't quit yesterday and you won't quit tomorrow. In my experience the change HAS to start today.""I was a smoker for about 10 years. I tried to quit several times before I finally managed to stick with it. Cold turkey with the help of Tootsie Pops is what finally worked for me. For the first week or two, whenever I would want a cigarette, I would have a Tootsie Pop instead. This helped to satiate the oral fixation aspect of smoking for me.

After the first couple weeks I was down to about two suckers a day, and after about a month I didn't need either. Now I can go out with friends that *do* smoke and not want one myself. ""I used the willpower method, but my wife successfully quit with chantix. She hasn't smoked for three years. and she LOVES smoking. "Move to MN in the winter -60 with wind chills really makes you want to quit smoking. "I had to use patches. They helped curve the cravings pretty well. Kept them on for about 3 weeks and tried a day without and it went okay. I'm not saying you have to completely alienate your friends that smoke but you've gotta stay strong enough to keep away from where they're going to smoke. Pick up a new hobby to pass the extra time. Learn to draw, study things that interest you, listen music, and as useless as it sounds, keep someone in mind you can talk to. A little positive reinforcement goes a long way""I went drinking in the pub with my smoker friends every night for a week and did not smoke.  It was among the most difficult things I've ever done, but effectively I used my initial enthusiasm for the idea of giving up to get me through that first week.  Then, in the later weeks when I felt like a cigarette I would think back on how difficult that first week was and refuse to waste that effort.

Still not smoking.  Nearly 10 years.""I tried quite a few times and obsessed over how hard it was and then one day - distracted by a new job - I just stopped without trying. It wasn't difficult and I never wanted to go back. 

This may sound easier said than done, but we I think we over think quitting and that makes it into a huge deal which is self-defeating.""Cold turkey! 

I smoked camel wides and marb reds for about 15 years. I been working as a wildland firefighter for a few years and started chewing when i was not smoking and doing both simultaneously.  
When I did not have money for a pack I would walk around getting butts out of ash trey's and bumming smokes.  I remember toward's the end of my addiction it was raining and all I could find was wet soaked butts.  I had to dry them out by puffing on them with a open flame of my bic lighter...nasty! plus coughing up shit all day everyday, yellow fingers, smelling like ass, constantly thinking about smokes...
I quit cold turkey February 26th 2013 about mid day...In the past I would always lie down to go to bed and think about how bad cigs where and how much I hated them but when I woke up I could not go very long without having one...so quitting mid day was something new.  First few days suck but I spent that time on smoking websites, youtube, smoking cell phone apps, I learned  everything I could about cravings from others whenever I had a craving...learn how nicotine breaks down in your system and why we have cravings...drink lots of water.

Even if you go back to smoking don't let that get you down. pick your self up, dust off and try again.

Every time you try and quit I think it's a small victory. It tells your brain that you can quit and you aren't a slave to nicotine...If you quit smoking but chew nicorete, take pills, or use electronic cigarettes and you still have nicotine in your system, your just fooling yourself and are still addicted to nicotine...I don't think there is a point in doing things half ass...

tl;dr Nicotine is bad and cold turkey is the best way to quit. ""I'm not a huge fan of cigarettes but iv been dipping for about 5 years now. It's gotten to the point where I almost subconsciously put a pinch in after I eat, when I drive, when I wake up, right before I go to bed, in class. Basically 24/7, and it comes out to about a can a day. My question is, do these tips for cigarettes work for smokeless tobacco, or is there another way?""only and best way to stop: Don't hang around with smokers until you haven't smoked in half a year or so and can stay strong when the occasional smoker drops in. I just completely stopped hanging out with smokers, especially when drunk."Meth. "I picked up and ecig 181 days ago and have not smoked since.  I am now down to no nicotine juice for the last 3 weeks, and will most likely stop the ecig in the next couple of weeks."I quit the day my daughter was born. Maybe you should try that?"Used to be a heavy smoker, hand-rolling helped me to smoke less overall, then somehow I ended up getting a pouch of menthol flavored ""Drum"" brand tobacco.  Even though I don't typically mind the taste of mint or menthol cigarettes, this particular blend was so foul that even a few drags were enough to disgust me into putting the cigarette out.  After a few days of this reduced smoking pattern I decided to quit and was successful.  I truly believe the weaning process was key to my success.  If you have the willpower to not go out and buy whatever tobacco or cigarettes you prefer, there is a chance it may work for you as well.  Best of luck.""Got sick for 10 days, then got better for 5 days, smoked those days, got nasty bronchitis that ruined a vacation. Decided right then while pouring snot out and feeling my throat and lungs bleed, that was it.""I tried cold turkey several times but I never could make it past the 3rd day. However, I learned more about the nature of the habit, and myself each time. 

I enjoyed smoking, but I hated aspects of it, so I started to consciously pay more attention to the things I disliked to condition myself to dislike smoking overall until I couldn't stand it any more. 

My brother tried Chantix, but started up again after a few months, because he didn't change any other aspect of his lifestyle. 

I switched from Camels and Marlboros to full-strength American Spirits on a whim and discovered I could go longer between cigarettes. I then progressively forced myself to switch to lighter cigarettes every few months or so until I was smoking their lightest ones. It took about a week for my nicotine tolerance to normalize and get used to them, so I had to force myself through a week of unsatisfying cigarettes.

When I smoked Marlboro Lights, I could only go about 2 hours without a cigarette before I was absolutely fiending. When I smoked the ultra-light American Spirits (Orange pack at the time) however, I could go 16-18 hours and that allowed me to distinguish *craving* a cigarette from just wanting one.

When I first started smoking, I would look for ways to add another cigarette into my day, so when I resolved to quit, I had to to the opposite and break down the overall habit into small individual habits, eliminating them one by one:

Û¢ I never smoked inside, so that part was easy. 

Û¢ I stopped smoking while driving (that was HARD)

Û¢ I stopped smoking after eating

Û¢ I stopped smoking in the morning

Û¢ I stopped smoking after sex

Û¢ I stopped going to bars as much because I would smoke excessively while drinking

Û¢ I stopped smoking after 10PM.

It took me a few weeks to get accustomed to each of these.

At that point I was down to 2-3 cigarettes per day: One after work, one before bed and sometimes another one in between.

After I was able to stick with this list for a month I tried to quit cold turkey one more time, but whenever my cravings came on I was just too irritable to function. I couldn't get past the third day.

I got a prescription for Chantix and after 2 weeks (October 5th, 2012), I had stopped smoking entirely. I finished out the prescription (a full month) and avoided bars, coffee shops and any other place or person with whom I strongly associated smoking.

About a month in, 2 friends died unexpectedly, within a couple weeks of each other. I accepted that I would have one cigarette for the sake of normalcy, enjoyed it and didn't have another one. 

The hardest thing about quitting was growing the fuck up and actually saying no to the spoiled brat in me that felt entitled to cigarettes.

When you're addicted to something, your life is usually really crappy in some way, because the stress and chaos becomes the justification you use to maintain the habit. Once the habit is gone, you realize that you are the one making your life crappy and there simply is no reason to continue doing that. 

The key was being honest with myself so I could take ownership of my choices. In the past, I would tell myself not to smoke over and over, dreading the fact that I knew I would smoke, and then emotionally beat myself up over it. Eventually I realized that the only reason I had failed is because I wasn't honest with myself about what was really going to happen, so I stopped all that nonsense and started admitted to myself that yes, I was in fact going to do it. At that point I was able to honestly say that if I went to a bar or a coffee shop, I would definitely smoke and so I just stopped going. If I knew I was going to have a cigarette, I didn't set myself up for failure by pretending otherwise. This greatly simplified my life.

Taking ownership of my choices instead of constantly feeling powerless against them was the tipping point that helped me really make the changes I needed.

The physical cravings went away entirely after about 10 days on Chantix. They tell you to keep smoking normally and you'll just stop wanting them. That's exactly what happened.

The sentimental cravings stuck around for several months however, but again, that was just a matter of being an adult, saying no to myself and moving on. It really helped that I absolutely hated the smell of cigarette smoke almost immediately after quitting. I disliked it already but man was it awful afterward. 

It took a couple months to relearn how to deal with life and not be an impatient jerk, but I eventually calmed down and got back to enjoying life again. 

I'm so glad I quit. It was easier than I expected and all of the worries I had were for nothing. It was absolutely worth the effort. 

If you haven't already, I suggest subscribing to /r/stopsmoking, even if you aren't ready to quit just yet. It'll help you prepare and find motivation.""(My dad, not me) getting and surviving cancer. Gave him a reality check""3 things. 

1 - someone very close to me got cancer. Visiting an oncology ward was a big nope. 

2 - reading that 50% of smokers die from smoking related illnesses. 

3 - repeatedly telling myself that I was bigger than my addiction and that I could beat it and become a non smoker. I went cold turkey and it was tough but it was something I really, really wanted to be free of. I've never looked back. "Ecigs..I smoked for 16 years at a pack per day. To me there is no excuse as to why someone cannot quit with these being available. You can also step down the nicotine level over a period of time until you reach 0mg. It was an very easy transition. Stop buying cigarettes."14 years ago I was made redundant and it was eat or smoke.  I chose not to starve and here I am still not smoking.

Don't buy them, don't put yourself in harms way by picking up a different rest habit.

Take it a day at a time.

I still have a recurring dream that I am smoking but that's all it is.

However, don't replace cigs with food...I am now trying to give that up.."I got a girlfriend who absolutely hates smoking. And she would hate kissing me after I'd had a cigarette. Stopped smoking two weeks into the relap"I got pneumonia and it HURT to smoke. It took me a couple of weeks to fully get over it and by that time, my cravings were gone. Having said that, I don't recommend actually attempting to get sick."A healthy hatred of the smoking and what comes with it. You have to replace smoking with something that you can also get into the habit of. I have only gone 4-5 months ( honestly can't remember) but I remember working at a bar at the time and having to spend at least a hour outside watching people smoke and hating it. Good luck those of you out there. "The mindsets talked about here are key and important. 

An actual trick, the one I used: Do not buy them. Set a hard limit for yourself to never buy them. I found that it is a much easier limit to follow. Saying ""Im quitting smoking"" is slightly nebulous and difficult to do. It is a broad task. The specificity of ""I will not buy cigarettes"" its easier. Also, you aren't addicted to buying them, just smoking them, so making that decision at the store its much easier. 

Every once in a while, i will be drunk, and see someone smoking. I will bum one and love it. I won't buy them, though. And I won't bum a lot, because i hate feeling like a, well, bum. So you go a bit easy on yourself by thinking you can still bum them, but it will be a rare occurrence. 

Tl:dr - Just don't BUY them. 

YMMV, but it really helped me and my wife quit. 3 years and counting, with the occasional bummed one.""I got really sick. Like too sick to even want to smoke and then I used the nicotine patches. 

I work in a cigar bar so whenever I'm working I'm surrounded by people smoking.

You also have to really want to quit.""Do some research into the science. Not only will it give you methods that work, but it's kind of like when you buy running clothes and sneakers to motivate you to start running: you'll have already incorporated quitting into your life."http://gwhyatt.blogspot.com/2008/04/quit-smoking-sith-way.html"For me it wasn't planned. Woke up in the morning, decided on the spot that I didn't want to smoke anymore and that was it. QuitNow app helped to see my progress and take courage the first weeks but after a while I decided it was consuming my precious SD card space and deleted it.""The patches helped me and my girlfriend. And determination. 
"A smokers a smoker when the chips are down. "Too bad I'm a bit late to this party, but the BEST thing to do when trying to quit is move. 

Get to another city, or somewhere else, and start a routine without smoking. ""Very Cold Turkey

If you can get past the first three days with out a cig. The cravings gradually diminish."E-cig got me off of cigarettes. And a ton of will power. Once I got off nicotine I wanted it so bad but if you just remeber how gross you feel the urge to stay off it over powers the urge to use it"I am a 22 year old male from Sweden and i used to ""Snus""(Highly addictive) since i was 13 years old until 21. I took a look at my teeth one day and said holy shit what am i doing, and i threw it all away and just stopped. I took on average 24 snus per day. Easiest method is just quitting without those stupid scams like patches, gums etc.""After smoking for 11 years and trying to quit several times using patches, gum, welbutrin, and other cessation methods; the biggest key to me quitting was the mental decision to not be a smoker anymore.  I couldn't cheat my way there, I had to actually commit to the idea that I was not going to smoke anymore, and I used nicotine lozenges very occasionally to help with the worst cravings which stopped after a week.
Not everyone's best method, but it worked for me.""A hot girl that I thought I had a chance with + Chantix + a cubic fuckton of will power.

When my quit day came, I had been taking Chantix for a week.  I still wasn't ready to quit and didn't want to, but I did.  I told myself if I made it a day without smoking, I could reward myself with a smoke.  It sucked but I made it through that day and did NOT reward myself with a cigarette.  Then I told myself, if I can make it two days, I'll reward myself with a cigarette.  Two days came and went and I told myself, make it a week and then you can have a cigarette.  

This is when I realized that I was quitting.  *When you quit, you can't reward yourself with that which you are giving up.*  That's completely counterproductive.  This is why I am against nicotine replacement such as lozenges, strips, gum, etc.  You're trading the delivery method of your addiction (cigarettes) to a delivery method sold by a pharmaceutical conglomerate.  But you're still pumping your body full of that same addictive substance.  Like George Carlin said, ""it's not what drugs you're on, but who's.""

In the end, when I quit smoking, I quit completely.  And that is about as cold turkey as it can get, even with the help of Chantix.  It's been over 4 years now and I have not had a single molecule of nicotine in my body since I quit.

I miss it.  I always will.  I still think about it sometimes.  I love the smell of smoke and often will hang out outside with the smokers just to get a whiff of the smoke.  And while I miss smoking and always will, I don't regret quitting either.""It's not really a trick but I'll tell you what went through my head when I finally quit after many failed attempts. I truly believe it is an essential thought process if you ever want to fully quit and have it last. It's been about a year and a half since I quit and I think I'm finally done with them for good, I can't see any reason I would go back now. I smoked for about 5 years and was able to quit completely cold turkey the moment I made the decision

All that I had to change was my mindset. All the other times, I still thought of myself as a smoker trying to quit. Every time I would have a break at work, was driving home, or after a meal, I would subconsciously consider myself as a smoker trying to quit. When I was a smoker, I really wanted a cigarette and it was excusable to want one because I was still a smoker, I was just trying to quit. Didn't go for a couple days without one? Well I might as well just have one, because I'm a smoker and I need one, even thgh I'm trying to stop.

Then, when I finally quit all I did was tell myself, I no longer smoke. I just do not do it anymore, I'm not a smoker from this point on. Every time someone would offer me one (which was a lot, because it was common for me and my friends to bum them off each other) I would just say ""no, I don't smoke"". Say it just like that, no additional ""trying to quit"" or ""oh no, don't tempt me"" or anything like that. Just repeat the same line, you may even want to tell it to yourself out loud when you get a craving ""no thank you, I don't smoke"". For some reason it became sooo much easier to say no to myself because I beat it into my own brain that I was not a smoker. I would even go outside with my friends while they had a cigarette and it nearly felt like I was going through with the whole ""ritual"" of going out for a cig to relax. 

I believe that is the reason why top comment says studies show that cold turkey is he best way, because if you smoke some it keeps you in the smoker mindset even though you are cutting down. You will still feel like you have the need and that it's excusable to slip up because you are still a smoker and quitting is hard. Be accountable for your own mindset and don't excuse those pervasive thoughts of cigarettes and when you do get one of those cravings, shame yourself for it rather than feel like it's constantly nagging at you.  Every time you get a craving, just tell your own mind to shut the fuck up and deal with it, because your body is no longer a smoker.""Chantix. 25 yr. habit. Quit jn less than a month. Have NEVER had another craving.

Honestly, if I could have done cold turkey I would have. That addiction had me wrapped up. 

The most important aspect of it for me was that I desperately wanted to quit. Chantix got me there. Gotta talk to your doctor though. That shit really can make people crazy if it's not prescribed. Even then, you need to be aware of your body and stop if you start feeling the crazies.  ""I've quit a few times. I've slipped a few times. I've been without for over 18 months now. I know I'm better off for it, but there is always that part of my brain that tells me I like it. That I miss it. The tricks the brain play on you are very real. I tend to agree that successful quitting is an act of pure willpower. Your head will be messing with you so hard and only willpower is going to keep you to task.

The use of patches did help but they are not a magic bullet. I've used them each quit attempt, and they were best for breaking the social habits or other smoking triggers. The drive to and from work, after a meal, etc, whatever they happen to be are easier to brush off without the physical craving. 

You still have to quit the patches. When it comes time to reduce the dose and switch to the next step you gotta do it and that is also hard. 

I don't believe that I'll ever stop thinking that it would be nice to have a smoke every now and then. The most certain thing I can say about quitting is that those urges get easier to manage each day after the quit date. ""I quit ""cold turkey"".

But the biggest thing was:  I wanted to change my lifestyle - completely.  I had just gotten married, and we just got pregnant with our son.  

Back at this time, it was still legal to smoke in bars and restaurants.  
One of my biggest triggers was social smoking, at bars.

Marriage was such a huge 180 for me. It's not that I stopped going to bars, but I went from like 3 nights a week to once or twice a month.

Since that time, after about 2 years of no cigarettes at all, I had trouble every time I either went to a bar, or walked through a foyer where people were smoking.  Cravings.  I would occasionally smoke one or two.  I was so happy when I moved to a state where smoking was banned in restaurants and bars.  Made it so much easier.

Another thing is Wellbutrin. That's supposed to help.""Commitment just that, really, it works for me.""I smoked 1.5 packs a day for 15 years. In 2009, my mom worked for a company called Pfizer, most well known for its little blue pill for men. They also develop many other drugs and this little gem called Chantix was just released by them. I had also decided and committed to quitting first before anything because I knew that was the real key to success. 

There are 2 dates you need to set when going this route: date 1 is the day you begin taking it. Date 2 is your quit day. You're supposed to take the chantix every day for a week then quit and then keep taking the chantix for another 3 weeks. It does some hocus pocus like blocking the brains nicotine receptors and what happens is after that first week, your brain feels as if you've never had nicotine in the first place and you can just put the cigarettes down and that's it. 

I set date one so that date 2 coincided with the anniversary of my dads passing away from cancer as kind of a motivation to stick with it. Date one rolls around and I begin taking the chantix. Now, if you've seen the commercials for it, they give you a laundry list of side effects, such as nausea and crazy dreams. They weren't kidding! I could only handle it for the week leading up to my quit date and I stopped taking it the day I quit smoking. It was the 8 year anniversary of my dads passing at that time. Ever since then my brain has subconsciously associated smoking with being sick to my stomach and refuses to let my smoke.  It will be 5 years this August that i quit. The exception is I have a cheap cigar once or twice a month if I go to a casino or something because I enjoy that. 

I can't believe its almost been 5 years already!

TL;DR: chantix works ""For me it was will power. I really wanted to quit so I did. I quit cold turkey when I was ready and its been almost 5 and a half years now smoke free. After 15 years of smoking it feels amazing to be free of the cigarette. Nothing is going to help you quit if you don't want to, if you really want to quit you can do it without any help from other nicotine products.""I went cold turkey. Locked myself in my apartment for 3 full days with nothing but Netflix, Chinese delivery and pepto bismol. Worst 72 hours of my life, but I haven't so much as touched a cig in 2 years ""I quit cold turkey. The trick was that I also stopped drinking for a year as well. I could control myself during the week, but when it was drinkin' time, I couldn't help myself.

""Bronchitis. I didn't smoke for very long, about 5 years, but I was smoking about two packs a day and then I got bronchitis. Couldn't smoke for two weeks straight and at that point I was like, ""well, I guess I'll quit."" The cravings never really leave though, they just get less frequent and easier to deal with.""Ecigs were what worked for me. I smoked for 26 years heavily, and nothing worked for me to quit. But as I got older, I really started to notice that my health was suffering, I would get out of breath, cough constantly and have a tightness in my chest that never went away. 

I found an ecig shop close to where I live one day and went in and had a chat. They gave me different juices to try and when I found one that tasted good to me and gave me the throat hit I was looking for I knew I was done smoking. It will be a year on valentines day since I smoked any tobacco, and I have come down to a very low nicotine juice.

Ecigs are awesome but they take a bit of work finding one that works for you. The cig lookalikes aren't worth the bother though. Get a tank and battery combo!""Buy a pack of smokes. Put no limit on how many you can smoke in a day. See how long you can go between smokes. The gaps will get shorter until you just stop. I used to want a smoke because I knew I couldn't have one. But if I didn't restrict myself it was fine, I didn't sweat about it. ""Do you drink alcohol?  That will be your biggest hurdle, It is almost impossible to quit when you drink regularly.

 Smoke pipe tobacco, its delicious, cheap, smells great, SATISFYING, and lastly one of the 'easier' ways to ween yourself off.... Took me 2 months.""If you want to stay quit, find a reason not to start back up. For me, I started working out and became a healthier person. I feel great and don't want to smoke because I don't want to give up feeling great. I've quit many times but I never stuck with it until I became a non-smoker instead of just being a smoker who quit smoking."My father dying of a heart attack.  I quit cold turkey."Cold turkey after deciding to quit for myself, of my own volition. Smoked filterless Lucky Strike cigarettes for nine years, quit May of last year.

I stocked up on jerky and chewy candies to occupy that hand-mouth behavior until I got over the two week bridge.""Cold turkey for sure.  Coupled with being ready to quit AND truly wanting to quit.  I also use those fancy, expensive ""chewing sticks"" (toothpicks) that are made from birch wood and soaked in tea tree oil.  They are really hard and they almost get spicy as you chew on them.""I quit cold turkey, but whenever I tried quitting suddenly, I could not handle it so I relapsed quickly. It only worked when I started quitting gradually, first conditioning myself to realize that I'm not even enjoying the smokes but am rather doing it out of habit, then by slowly changing this habit by cutting out one ritual cigarette after another (e.g. smoking on the way to the car, on the way home from work, on lunch break, etc). Several days would pass before I would cut out another habitual cigarette. I toughed out each of these habit cuts by thinking about how pleasant the next ritual cigarette would feel. One Monday, after I whittled my habit to half a cigarette a day (I was smoking half-cigarettes for over a month at this point), I decided to go ahead and quit and see how long I'd last. My previous high scores, when I'd quit suddenly, would last a few days at best. This one has been running since last March. I still keep my last half a pack of Marlboro menthols in my drawer, along with a lighter, for easy access, just to rub it in my habit's face that there it is, I can smoke a boag any time I want, but I won't not because I choose not to.
I believe that, for most guilty pleasures, you're ready to start quitting on your own only when the ""guilty"" part eclipses the ""pleasure"" part. When I was quitting smoking, the first couple puffs made me go ""aaaaahh finally, the smokey goodness of relaxation"". Subsequent puffs made me think ""why am I doing this? I'm not even enjoying it. And I'm gonna feel crappier when I finish it, anyway. It's a stupid cancer stick."" At that point it pretty much ceased to be a pleasurable activity altogether.""My ex-girlfriend, and my mom, both smokers for over 15 years, quit with the help of e-cigarettes.""30 year smoker.  Failed to quit 100 times.  took chantix for a month without even trying to cut down or quit, then one afternoon 5 weeks in I realized that I had forgotton to have a cigarette for a couple of days.  I got one out, smoked it about half way, and just didn't like it.  I threw it out the window and never had another cigarette again.  Go Chantix.  It blocked all the pleasure receptors in my brain and allowed me to get over the physical addiction to nicotine _while_ smoking!  What I learned is that it was only the physical addiction to the nicotine that was keeping me smoking.  Once that was done, I didn't care for them anymore.  

it was a physical addiction.  It wasn't about willpower or strength of character.  It was just a physical addiction.  A medical condition that was cured with medicine. ""By absolutely making my mind up that I was going to kick the habit and not allowing failure. I also took it 1 day at a time. Nothing fancy... 

I had smoked 2 packs a day or Marlboro reds for @ 16 years when I quit. ""I quit for ten years and never stopped wanting one, so accept that you will always want to smoke, and will have to say no for the rest of your life.""I first quit to ""get in shape"" and be healthy but that didn't last long. Then began dating a beautiful woman (over two years now!) that said how incredibly disgusting it was and she would never date a smoker.""I quit cold turkey, when I got pregnant, 20 or so years ago.

My husband quit a few years later using the patch and mints. He needed something to substitute for the oral habit, so he bought one of every kind of mints at the store to try. He settled on Altoids, and for about a month, we spent as much on altoids as he was spending on smoking. Then he tapered off the mints over the next month or two after that.

Be warned, one of the side effects is ""vivid dreams"". If you have a partner you sleep with, you wearing the patch at night may affect them too. He decided not to wear it at night as a result of the vivid dreams he was having. I was fine with my vivid dreams sleeping next to him though. ""I tried twice when using patches, and gum. Failed quickly.

The third time, I went up to our family ranch - notably away from booze - for a couple months to work. Kept myself busy and didnt really have any trouble dropping the habit.

This is after a pack a day for a decade, if that makes any difference."Wanting to. I chose a method that i think is super effective but wanting to quit is the most important thing. PM me if you think you need a specific method."Quitting is easy. I did it loads of times. :-) 

On a serious note though it all comes down to motivation. My then girlfriend said she wouldn't move in to a flat with a smoker. So I had a choice. Spending money giving myself lung cancer or sharing a flat (and by extension a bed) with my girlfriend. Choices like that are actually pretty easy. I just went cold turkey. No patches or e-cigs etc. 

She's my wife now. It was definitely worth it.  ""I stopped smoking when I started dating my now fiancÌ©. He didn't mind that I smoked but I was very self conscious about how I smelled. So, every single time I saw him I would go home after work, smoke 5 cigarettes, take a shower and head the other direction to see him. It wasn't hard not smoking when we were together even though we would drink a lot and that the best time to smoke! I finally got sick of all the hassle and just stopped. I stopped after 15 years and it's been 5 years since. What also made me stop was when I thought... I'm not in high school anymore and I look pretty stupid smoking because I supposedly 'need' to. ""I had a kid and that was the inspiration to quit cold turkey.  it's been about 1.5 years and  I don't get cravings much at all any more, maybe once in a blue moon.  Good luck and hang in there OP.""Just quit. One thing that really helped for me was buying a stack of (non-nicotine) gums. Everytime I would crave, i would just take a fresh gum and try to think of other things.

Also weed.""Cold turkey, after a bout w/a flu so intense I couldn't smoke anyway. It was my third attempt and have been a non-smoker for 14 years now.

The ultimate trick? Really, it' simple, in principal anyway:during periods of intense craving (the frequency of which gradually diminished over time thankfully) I would tell myself that later on I could smoke AS MUCH AS I WANT! - but just - NOT RIGHT NOW! No matter how bad it got I knew I'd let myself have one, or 20, and believe it or not the thought of all those fresh cigs lined up awaiting got me through those intense but temporary urges, which lasted the better part of a year (about nine months actually). It was probably 7 years before they stopped altogether, or truth be told, still happened but were so brief in duration I would find myself asking, ""Did I just crave a cig?""

So I conned myself basically, but was able to go along with the ruse because the overwhelming urge to smoke would always diminish soon enough for basic will power to take over, although for months it was always very touch and go.
""I'd been smoking a pack and a half a day for about 18 years when I quit after using Chantix, only used it for about 6 weeks though. Have been smoke free for about 4years now.""The way that worked for me was to go for a run. Seriously though, go outside run a 5K for a benchmark time. Then try to quit and compete with that time. It does help if you have a competitive spirit. One year later I have trimmed my time down from 34 minutes to 24 minutes, with hopes to get it down 5 more minutes. Not to mention you'll heal your lungs faster, you'll get in better cardiovascular shape, and you'll just all around feel better about yourself."What worked for me is this ( Im a 22 year old guy )  Every time I want a cigarette I picture myself dying of cancer in a hospital bed at the age of 25 all by myself.  Then I dont want a cigarette anymore.  Give it a shot I guess"Anxiety. I was constantly have anxiety and panic attacks. I didn't understand why. So I quit smoking everything, cigarettes and weed, and cut the majority of caffeine out of my life other than my morning cup of coffee. Still have anxiety attacks, but they're much more manageable. It's been almost three years, and I quit cold turkey. I was a smoker for about four years. ""First of all, you have to want to quit. Not your SO,kids, parents or anybody, you. Then get it in your head about what life will be like without smoking. YOu have to prepare your mind for the lack of your best friend, cigarettes. But then I used Zyban and weed to et oveer the smoking crave."Working with kids. First day I started a third grade boy asked why I smelled like his uncle. I stopped that day and haven't looked back."Bike commuting did it for me. I smoked irregularly but, consistently for 17 years. And this is the only thing that worked. ""Started dating a girl who didn't smoke.  She HATED when I would light up and wouldn't kiss me etc. (because of the smell).  Just little things like that.  Last straw was one time at a friends - we were all hanging out and drinking (I had started only smoking while drinking).  I light a cigarette and she grabs one too and lights up.  She said 'If you are going to, then I am too.""  5 years later we are married and I am smoke free.""My great uncle was a heavy smoker. One day the government raised taxes on cigarettes. He was very conservative and strongly opposed to the tax increase. So he vowed to never buy another cigarette again. As a result he quit cold turkey on a day's notice.

So I guess the answer is willpower. External motivation helps too, whether it's political or a friend/SO.""8 years, cold turkey, 2 months down. As everyone has already said, you really just need a good reason to quit. ""I put the money I would've spent on cigarettes into building my record collection. If I cut back 2 packs over the course of a week, I could go to the record store and buy a record that weekend.
Seeing what the money I was spending on cigarettes gradually build something I enjoyed was my motivation to cut back more and more until I was completely done.""You really have to want to quit in order for any method to work. Otherwise you'll keep smoking. I was smoking about 3 packs a day when i just decided I'd had it with smoking. So I went to my doctor and asked to be put on smoking cessation drugs. She basically told me she was only prescribing me a 2-3 week supply of Zyban with no refill and said that if I was going to quit I would do so within that amount of time. I actually stopped smoking before the pills ran out. That was eleven years ago. I have never wanted another cigarette since, but I occasionally have dreams where I am smoking again.""In short, I had a daughter. I had tried to quit smoking a few times before that, made it 6 months at one time before my dumb ass decided to have just one and oops. Then, my GF(now ex sadly) got pregnant. I spent 9 months in terror of being a dad til one day pop, there she is. I held her for the first time, and I decided it was time to grow up and be an adult. I quit smoking cold turkey, but I also stopped doing a lot of drugs and drinking. I was a pretty bad alcoholic, so that month sucked. But every time I looked down at my little girl, I knew I had to nut up and stay the course. I know this may not help you quit, but sometimes you just need a trigger to keep you quit. Good luck""To be honest, dating someone who doesn't smoke works pretty well. ""I quit about 7 months ago, and stopped taking gum and using the patch 5 months ago. I haven't had a drag since the day that I quit, which was the day I found out that I was going to be a father. 

You see, my father smoked and had to use oxygen for the last few years of his life; he eventually died because of the consequences of his life decisions (liver cancer from alcohol-related Hepatitis C, emphysema, etc.). It was a 10+ year period of hospital visits and bed confinement, and was a long, brutal way to die at the age of 55. When my wife told me that she was pregnant, I realized that I was putting myself at risk of  a similar fate - as well as my children. 

I gathered my smoking cessation devices: the previously mentioned patches and boxes of nicotine gum, as well as several electronic cigarettes. While the E cigs were helpful at first, I was still using them at the same times that I had smoked, such as after meals, whenever I felt nervous, etc. I knew that unless I stopped continuously conditioning my brain to need nicotine at any moment's notice, I would never truly be free of smoking. So I put down the E cigs and focused on being more healthy and using meditation and deep breathing techniques to calm myself during tense situations. 

I am now healthier and feel better than I have in years, and surprisingly I rarely crave a cigarette (even when I'm around them). And with a baby coming any day know (due date is tomorrow), I feel pretty good knowing that I haven't exposed my wife to any 2nd or 3rd degree smoke and that if I keep up this healthy lifestyle, my children (hopefully) should never have to see me have a two hour coughing fit, need to replace my oxygen tank, and/or die a slow and painful death at the age of 55. 

TLDR: Don't want to die in my 50's, but more importantly don't want my children to see me die. And feeling good = good. 
 ""I think the thought of allowing myself to be controlled by an inanimate object initially compelled me to quit over 3 years ago.  Ecigs, nicorrete, and lozenges helped the first 6 months.

I smoked one cigarette a couple weeks ago which threw off my equilibrium(I literally fell over), made me dizzy, and dry heaved in my toilet.

I will never smoke again.""Water!

I know this is going to sound funny, but I quite smoking due to water. I quite cold turkey. I got really sick and for the first time in my life I had to struggle to breath. Once I got better I made the decision to quite.

I walked around with these huge bottles of water. I had read somewhere that smoking dehydrates you and that chugging water could help pass intense cravings. So whenever I had a craving to smoke I would start chugging water.

Lets be honest, for the first three days I was pissing like every 15min. It was hell, but it actually worked. Something about taking my mind off wanting a cigarette plus the cold water helped the cravings pass. I did this for about three days like a nut case. After about a week or two I didn't need a lot of water, but still had a bottle of water handy. I can honestly say after about a week or two the cravings completely vanished.

However, did that mean I didn't want to have a smoke when I was out drinking or in the night when I woke up? No, years after I stopped smoking I would wake up and reach for my pack only to remember I no longer smoked. The craving and addition is really easy to kick, changing who you are is not so easy. It took about 1-2 years before the ritual of smoking completely left my system.

It has been nine years since my last smoke. I can say that even being around smokers I have  absolutely no temptation to have a smoke and have never felt better.""I grew to hate it over time so I just stopped. I made the decision that smoking wasn't going to be part of my life anymore.

Alan Carr's The Easy Way to Quit Smoking helped a bit. I read maybe 1/4 of it after I had already quit and that helped with the cravings. Then I started going for the high score in days without smoking (a smoking cessation app on the phone with a counter). Then after a while, you just forget to check.""You can do what I did. Smoke a ton of ciggarettes one evening, stress yourself out pretty bad, then dial 911 because you think you might be having a heart attack. That set me straight and I bet it would work for you too.""I actually had an app that helped me the most. It was called... iQuit? On Apple. 

Our was a timer basically. You set it up saying how many cigarettes you smoke per day, and how many hours between your first and last cig of the day (like 16 hours or whatever).

It spaces your smokes out over that time, so every time you want a cig, look at the app. If it's green, go ahead and smoke. If it's red, the timer will show you how much longer you have to wait. Each time you have a smoke, the intervals between them get a little tiny bit longer.

I found that it threw me off of my habit. I would see the timer say there was like 2 minutes left until I could smoke and i'd think ""yeah I can last that long let me go do this one other thing in the meantime."" Eventually I forgot to come back to the app and have my smoke. If I couldn't wait, it had ""cheats"" so you could smoke now but it would still reset the amount of time until your next one.

I tried cold turkey and just couldn't do it. This method took about a year but I found it worked really well. ""As someone who used to have a serious drug problem(almost 4 years clean), cigarettes are almost as hard to quit. They are on every corner. They are somewhat socially acceptable. You will see people smoking everywhere. You will smell people smoking everywhere. Those urges will NEVER go away just like my drug of choice was/is for me. At least I had to go searching for the drug, hell, I can buy cigarettes EVERYWHERE. The only way to quit anything is to be 100% DONE. Mentally if you arent saying things like,  ""I am done with this shit. Its gross and im sick of the way it makes me feel and the struggles that are associated with it"" you are probably ready. If you are saying things like, ""I should probably quit"" or ""everyone hates that I smoke I should quit"" you probably arent going to be successful. Get your mind ready because your are going to have to be strong no matter what technique you use. I'm almost ready myself...""6 month quitter here

I tapered off, down to two cigarettes a day (from about a pack a day) over a period of two weeks, and just... quit

The reality of e-cigs is: they don't really work. They help with the tapering, but as long as the nicotine is in your system, you will still want to smoke. My two relapses came when I thought I could take a casual ecig puff again when I was stressed. Started smoking again a day later.

I have to say those NYC anti-smoking commercials helped. I just didn't want to commit slow suicide anymore. The support of my fiance, of course, helped a ton. But she never nagged about it."My dad was a pack a day until he had a stroke.  I think that may have helped with the whole cold turkey thing."It took a change in my routine and environment. I took a month long winter session course at a different school and lived with my SO. I got out of class one day, realized I hadn't had a cigarette and decided to stop. Spending weeks away from home and my routine made things a lot easier.""Electronic cigarettes; it was a seamless transition, did not take a ounce of effort from my part. Started using liquids at a 16mg/ml nicotine level and each month I decreased the concentration by 2. Now I am not addicted to nicotine but keep vaping 0mg liquids for the pleasure of it.

For some context, I smoked about 50 cigarettes per day for 7 years."Chantix.   Worked like magic...4 years smoke freeI stopped feeling depressed with consoling and a change of friends."We are all creatures of habit, remember that.  I was very lucky to be starting a new summer camp job after smoking for nearly 7 years.  I told myself that I would not smoke while there and I bought some nicorette gum for tough days.

Obviously you're not starting new job, but look at what your everyday habits are... the things you do without even knowing.  Actively look to change your habits, maybe change up your work space, how you get to work, your schedule, add in working out change it to another time in the day.  Transitions are tough but the more you can deliberately alter your habitual schedule the more chances you have of deliberately making it your own and choosing what things to add (or dismiss).""The prospect of meeting and dating girls.  I decided that if I did not want a wife that smoked, that I should no longer smoke.  After 1 month of quitting I met my wife.  Sure I have had 20 or so over the last 3 years, but only when I am away for the weekend or something.  I quit cold turkey and I have no sympathy for weak minded people who say that they cannot quit cold turkey.  I smoked for 4 years before quitting and sure it was hard, but it was not that difficult that anybody could do it if they wanted to.  I think that the real issue is that most people are not willing to change the way they do things.  Do you smoke in the car? stop doing that.  Do you take smoke breaks? stop doing that.  Once you cut down on the time you allow yourself to smoke it becomes easy.""Like a lot of the top comments are saying, I too quit cold turkey. I realized from past failures that a lot of the addiction I had was mental. What some call an oral fixation. So I bought a bag of hard candy to suck on when cravings got bad. 

Still off the nic sticks to this day. ""I was a 1 pack-per-day smoker at most, but the way I quit was a combination of things:

1) being broke as the price of cigs kept going up and up forced me to stop buying packs   
2) deciding I didn't really want any of the fine long-term health benefits that come from tobacco was a strong motivator   
3) resorting to scrounging half-smoked cigs out of ashtrays for a while.

Number 3 was admittedly gross and pathetic, but that's the kind of thing addicts do. Risking Bubonic Aidsplagueherpescancer from some random person's cigarette butt didn't seem as bad as turning down some delicious burning tobacco.   Eventually I grossed myself out enough that I quit and haven't smoked in 7 years.

""I smoked from the age of 16 to 21. I wanted to start losing weight and feeling better in general. So, i joined a gym. Not being able to run very well pushed me to want to quit the smokes even more. So i started writing on my calendar at work everyday. I would write how many i had that day and cut down gradually. After about 2 weeks i was down to one a day. Kept going to the gym, and this kept my will power strong and motivated me to be healthy. I would write on the tender no smokes today. Some days i would cheat and have a couple drags here and there. I would always mark if i cheated. The days i cheated made me feel bad so the push to quit was even stronger. It has been over a year now without cigarettes, although i will admit i have snuck the ""drunk drag"" when Im shitfaced, which is rare cuz i hardly drink. I also smoke weed, and i mostly vape to prevent lung gunk, but i guarantee that mj has not inhibited my performance at the gym. I've lost 30 lbs and now i feel like a new person. The change is slow but if you keep it constant it will make a big difference. :) good luck dude/dudette
""There were 3 key points that got me to quit permanently.

#1 - You have to seriously WANT to quit. I tried quitting many times before I was really 100% mentally ready. You have to really want it. You can't be like, ""Man I wish I could quit smoking."" or ""I kinda wanna stop."". It didn't work for me until I was like ""Fuck this, I am done, I am killing myself.""

#2 - Cold Turkey. No cheat cigarettes or nicotine replacement. Every time you take nicotine into your body, all you do is extend the withdrawal symptoms. Instead of 3-7 days of agony, it becomes weeks or even months of agony. It gets easier after the initial 3 days, and every day past that is easier than the last.

#3 - Any time you have a craving, do something to get your mind off it. Seriously. Go for a walk, read an article, get a drink of water, Clean something, work out, do ANYTHING at all that isn't smoking until you forget that you wanted a smoke. Most cravings last about 5 minutes, so if you can kill those 5 minutes, you can last until the next craving, at which time you will want to find another thing to do. My house was so clean by the time my cravings were done, it was a nice little bonus.

A side note - A lot of people say that you can go from being addicted 100% to being a ""once in awhile"" smoker. I wouldn't recommend it. Out of every friend I have who quit for over a year who decided one drunken night to have a single smoke, they ALL went back to smoking full time, pack a day habits. In my eyes, it is just not worth it.

This site kinda helped me: www.whyquit.com (Warning - pictures of sick people)

Haven't smoked for 3 years, so it definitely worked for me. Keep in mind, the cravings don't go away. Ever. They just become weaker, shorter and less frequent. Even after 3 years, sometimes I'll get one. They are much different now though. Now its more like a 5 second thing, where randomly every 2 months or so, I'll see a smoke and be like ""Man I could go for a sm....no fuck that"" and the craving is over that fast.

Keep trying, it's not easy. It took me multiple tries before I got it. (not cheating was the biggest key to success for me)
""I once read that if you quit by time your 30, you have a 95% less chance of getting lung cancer. So, I would always say, I'll quit when I turn 30. Next thing I knew, 14 years had passed and I was quickly approaching my 30th. 

So, I quit cold turkey on my 30th and it worked. I think a big reason why it worked was my 30th was a red letter date. If I smoked again, I couldn't ever go back to my 30th and I might have to wait until I was 40 before I went back. 

Being mentally prepared to never smoke again is the key. ""I have half a pack of ciggies that I can have any time I want. My trick was to have some around, but at home. Every time I had a craving at work I would tell myself I could have one when I got home. Doing this all day, then not having cig at home because my wife would KILL me, worked.

And patches. I haven't smoked in 7 years, but I still have that half pack of cigs. They must be stale as shit by now.""My girlfriend. We started dating, she didn't like me smoking. I didn't want to fight about it, so I quit cold turkey. 3 months without one now, and I feel great."Started vaping. Still hooked on nicotine but I can breath :) "You should look into ego style batteries and clearomizers, it gives you a better dose of nic as well as a much more satisfying experience ""This may be crushed under the cynicism of reddit but true love! I met another student who was an absolutely beautiful girl inside and out. We started dating and she knew I was a smoker and she didn't seem to care. Things began to get serious and she said, ""If you want us to be together I only ask you to change one thing please never smoke again."" It was extremely difficult but I have never smoked again. That was more than 10 years ago! We've been married for 7. People say you can't quit for someone else but I'm evidence to the contrary. 
""to me was to prove my friends wrong :) . they make fun of me saying ""you will never made it"" and just to prove them wrong i made it and with no looking back. 3 years ago""Having REAL reasons. My examples: wanting to more than casually date a girl who didn't like smoking at all, needing to pass a fitness run test for the military, knowing basic training will suck much worse with nicotine withdrawal. Stuff like this trumps any flimsy unspecific reasons."I helped my aunt quit. Said I would visit her if she stopped. She stopped by reading sone sort of book. And then I had to visit..."February 2nd will be one year smoke free for me after 8 years of pack a day smoking. I tried a bunch of different methods, cold turkey, gum, patches...the ONLY thing that's worked is e-cigs. I started with the store ones and the v2's but found myself going back to analog cigs every time. Once I found a good setup, for me an Itaste MVP, it has worked wonderfully and at this point Im not even a little tempted when someone Im with lights up.  ""I took part in 'Dryathalon' for January - cutting out drinking for one month. I tend to smoke when I drink, it seemed to really help. I now drink again but don't feel the compulsion to smoke."Vaping plain and simple"Hypnosis.  I'm not a new-agey kind of guy, but I was a pack-a-day smoker for 16 years and really wanted to stop.  Went to a hypnotist once, cost $125, and haven't touched a cigarette in more than 18 months.  Best $125 I ever spent.""The fear of paying more for life insurance and health insurance premiums.... 

I have aged parents and I wanted to take out a big life insurance policy to take care of them in case something happens to me. But I found that my smoker status greatly inflated my premiums so I decided to quit by going cold turkey. Currently I am smoke free for 4+ months and in another 5/6 months I will be classified as a non-smoker. ""I've quit twice over the course of my life. Both times the ""Cold Turkey"" method worked. I haven't smoked in over 2 years. I managed to sate my desire to blow smoke by smoking e-cigs with 0 nicotine juice. Until I finally got over that, and put it down for good. I haven't used the e-cig in over a year. My wife quit thanks to her pregnancy; we're both better off, and saving a shitload of money. 

It's all about willpower. If you can push through the actual ""withdrawl"" period, the rest is mind over matter.""Meditation. Being aware of my urges, feeling them fully and accepting their temporariness. A lot of water and excercise. "."It's easy. Pick a date when you are going to quit. Then, tell everyone you know that you are going to quit on that date, and that it will be easy, and that only losers can't give up cigarettes. Pride will keep you from smoking.

Also, for the first week or two, make sure you are busy doing things that you wouldn't normally smoke while doing. Eg if you smoke while watching TV, give up TV for a week at the same time. A huge part of it is just keeping yourself busy
""smoked for 8 years, quit once for 2 months, then end up smoking again. Motive: in my case stupidness. Is really simple to quit smoking. From what i see you smoke one pack a day, just like i used to. It's about 3 and half months since i quit again. If you don't have any dangerous health problems (another reason to quit) then it's a little harder. 
People think about quiting almost as something else should do it for them. It's false. Not the nicotine gum, not the patches not even the electronic cigarette are helping. All you have to do is trust yourself and say this is it. Today i'm going to do this. (also mean it-stop fooling yourself). Kirkirus has a really good point about quiting. 
The easiest way from my perspective is to adapt to a new way of living. Avoid people that are smoking (when they do it, not all the time), avoid places with a lot of smoke. When you fell like the world is ending if you don't smoke in that moment, try to do something else, anything (not smoking :)), eat something ( don't do that everytime you fell the world is ending or you end up a fatty), play something, call someone, go out and buy a toy for your family, anything that gets your mind from smoking. After a while you will start feeling all thoose things again, smell, taste etc. 
Conclusion: if you want it, you can do it! It's all about you!
Fuck smoking!"I started with snus and it basicly made me quit smoking in 2 days. I was a smoker for 4 years. So try snus"Almost similar...
In my case, I had to go through a surgery to remove my wisdom teeth, 4 of them at the same day, after that, during the recover the doctor asked me to know smoke for a couple days, after 2 days I was really bad but after 3 or 4 days I got used to not smoke, so I just kept the Doctor's advice one day at a time until the urge to smoke had gone for good."E cigs. Literally amazing I never thought I could quit and not really want to smoke. I thought it would always be a struggle. Not so"I quit cold turkey, went through so much gum for the next few weeks. I found that when ever I left the house that was the hardest part it was like what do I do when I'm walking anywhere. After a while I just sort of forgot about it. Can never get rid of those drunk cravings though""Cold turkey for me i'm afraid, this could also be seen as just when I REALLY wanted to quit""Heavy x-smoker, also tried everything. Cold turkey didn't work. Just got really pissed and started over eating, and then smoked double amount. Medicine that closes receptors worked, champix. Ciggies tasted like shit and didn't do ANYTHING for me anymore. Haven't smoked since then. ""I quit when I got diagnosed with a disease that is supposed to make my life a little different. So I pulled the ""grieve all at once"" saying and enjoyed a fun week, quitting after twenty years of smoking. I guess you can also call this a cold turkey quit. ""i'm in the process right now, i haven't smoked in 3 months. i work in retail, and it was a similar deal. i smoked cause i could take 10 minutes every hour if i wanted to. two biggest things that have helped me have been:

1. not drinking coffee anymore, it's tough but fuck does it help. i switched to tea instead, usually non-caffinated so i can use hot drinks as my ""break"" while i make it at work, very relaxing too.

2. tea tree oil toothpicks, for when you're really bugging out, they're great for the oral fixation.

honestly, those two have made this VERY easy for me, but i also did quit cold turkey.

any other questions, let me know. always glad to help.""Here's my personal truth: I cheated. 

And by that, here's what I mean: I never liked it to begin with. So why start? The military. Practically every training class (nearly two years of  ""A"" school) had a 15 minute break for smokers. Didn't smoke? Fine, sit your ass in that chair and just wait for 15 minutes. Or go piss. I learned to tolerate and even, in some ways, like smoking. I enjoyed how it made me feel. I enjoyed what it did to my nerves. I couldn't stand the taste, the smell, or the fact that it was killing me. I could feel it fucking up my lungs, but still I did it. Off and on for almost ten years from the legal age that I could smoke. 

So what made me finally decide to stop? My kids. As soon as I found out my fiance was pregnant, I vowed to stop completely. I slipped up every now and then, though, usually when I was drinking and needed something to hype up the buzz. 

But the final nail in the coffin (no pun intended) was when my father died. Diagnosed of Stage IV small cell carcinoma in October. Immediately quit smoking and went on chemo. We lost him that December. Since then, I've slipped up once and that was over two years ago. Every time it creeps into my mind or I'm surrounded by people that are smokers (usually when we're at a party, so it's pretty rare), I think of my Dad, I think of my kids and of losing them, and then it's easy to turn it down. Mostly because I never liked it in the first place. 

So I don't have any real or helpful advice on how to quit, sorry. Try Chantix, I heard that stuff works wonders. ""I quit on my 30th birthday after smoking for 12 years.  I am 36 now and have never had a nicotine craving since my last smoke. I've had the physical cravings of the act itself, but never for the drug. This is how I did it:

First I had already cut way back. I didn't smoke in the house. I didn't smoke in the car. A pack would last me 2-3 days when I started weaning myself off of them. 

My theory was that if I would steadily push back what time I started smoking everyday, and never smoked before the time I started yesterday, eventually I'd run out of day and not smoke anymore. The process took me about a month and a half, which, if I did it again, I would stretch out for an extra couple of week to make it easier, but my goal was to stop by my birthday so I pushed myself. 

Basically, if I had my first cigarette of the day today at 9am, tomorrow I wouldn't start smoking until 9:15. The only rule was I couldn't start earlier than yesterday. Some days I couldn't push the time back at all. I remember when my start time was around lunch time it was harder, so maybe for a week I was starting at noon before I was able to push it to 12:15. But after a few days I'd be used the later start, so I'd be able to go a little longer. 

I chewed on a ton of tootsie pops to get to that first smoke sometimes, but after the first smoke of the day, I'd never limit myself to how much I smoked. As long as I didn't start before the time I started yesterday, I could smoke all I wanted for the rest of the day. Over the month and a half the start time kept getting later and later until the day before my birthday, I went out at 10pm for what was my first cigarette of the day and the last cigarette I've smoked. I went to bed and never had a nicotine craving again. 

Like I said, at the time I felt like I rushed it at times. I think the more you're used to smoking, the longer it will (and should) take. But weaning myself off cigarettes was the easiest way I could imagine doing it, and it worked perfectly for me. 

Good luck!

""Cold turkey, if you can do it. I managed 9 months, then got complaicant and eventually became a smoker again.

I'm on the e-cigs these days, obviously still hooked on nicotine, but feeling a lot better. 

I hope to stop using them at some point, when cigs are a distant enough memory, but they'll do for now.

Fuck gum, patches, sprays, and especially fuck pills. I tried Champix years ago, made me turn into the Hulk, awful temper, not nice at all. Not everybody has a bad reaction to them, but I know enough that have to steer clear of them.""I gave up using the cold turkey method and it worked for like 3 months. As soon as I started drinking I would crave smokes though, eventually I succumbed one drunken night and I still haven't shook them. 

Whiskey and a cigarette is just too good.""Biggest thing (I think) is you have to be ready to stop.  When I tried to stop because I didn't think I could afford it or my girlfriend thought it was gross I failed.  When I decided for me that I didn't want to do it anymore it was easier.  

I picked a date (new year's day, so clichÌ©) and started getting ready by altering routines slightly.  Instead of smoking right after dinner I'd do dishes first, things like that. Then when the day came I used a patch.  Not the first step, I started with the second, and only did one box (2 weeks instead of the recommended 8 week program).  I think this helped because a) I knew I was still getting nicotine and that mentally made it easier when I wanted one and b) I knew that technically it can be dangerous to smoke on the patch, so extra deterrent with immediate consequences instead of far-off ones.  If I really wanted one, I would rub that patch and pretend I was massaging nicotine into me (stupid, but it helped).  After the box ran out I hadn't smoked in 2 weeks, so a large part of the habit was gone.  Then the withdrawal was less annoying, and it's short lived.  

Things to keep in mind that can help you stay the course - you'll feel better physically sooner than you think, and in ways you didn't think about.  It's sooo nice.  Cravings only last a couple minutes, so wait it out.  Habits are harder to break than nicotine, so beware of firsts, i.e. first time drinking, first time at your favorite hangout, all that.  Get past it once and you know you can do it again.  I also allowed myself little rewards, using some of the money I saved to have little treats when it was bothering me more.  

Remember, much of it is in your head, and if you want to be done with it it's easier than you thought it would be.  You just have to be ready.  Final thought, guilt is a killer!  If you slip up and sneak one, don't give up!  It's not the end.  People think, oh fuck I had a smoke, I failed.  This is false, just get back on the horse.  You'll get there.  

This was my experience.  YMMV, obviously, but these things helped me and I wish I'd known some of them at the time.  Good luck!""I wasnt a smoker but recently I started using ecigs, so it probably helps for quitting too"SavedChantix!

Honestly it was a lot easier than I thought it would be, but I also moved to a new state. A big part of addiction is the association with things like driving, eating, working. So a change a scenery makes a big difference. I read that a lot of soldiers in the Korean war were addicted to Heroin, but when they came back to the states the addiction went away.

While most people don't have the luxury of moving, it might help to go on a vacation for a few weeks while you try quitting. Or changing one habit at a time, like don't smoke after you eat a meal. Changing your behavior is the hardest part, the actual chemical addiction is much easier to deal with."Vaping"I couldn't sleep / let anyone else sleep because of the coughing. Every time i lay down, i would start coughing. I had so much phlegm in my mouth everytime coughed, it was disgusting. I quit because of that, and whadda ya know, the coughing stopped.""Cold turkey.

So I said,  fuck this fuck you fuck fuckity fuck! And quit right then. 
I quit out of spite and anger.
""I smoked two packs in one day on St Patrick's Day and when I woke up, sick as a dog, my body no longer wanted to smoke.

When I got better a week later and went to smoke a cigarette, I no longer liked it, it hurt to smoke and the desire completely went away. 

*I do not recommend my method.*""There is probably no way that OP will see this suggestion but, quit cold turkey while on a vacation. That's what did it for me."Chantix!  It is expensive (luckily my work paid 100%) but totally worth it in the long run.  Miracle drug that works.  I smoked a pack a day for 20 years and was able to quite with minimal withdrawal.  It's beena  year and a half and still not even a craving.  I can even be around friends that still smoke with no desire.  I love it!!!  Best thing I ever did."Pfft, I must have made more than fifteen attempts to quit before it finally stuck. 

My advice? Keep at it. Don't get discouraged when you have a moment of weakness, just quit again. Every time I quit I did a little bit better until one magical day when I realized that it had been a few days since I even thought about smoking, and that I was finally going to make it this time."Vaping is what got me to quit after smoking for 20 years. I started out on a higher nicotine level and bumped myself down. This Sunday will be my 1 year anniversary of quitting."Pregnancy, but to be honest with you I was never a huge smoker. Just when I was hanging with friends or drinking. I never really smoked when I was stressed or bored, and I *never* smoked when I was alone. ""I got crazy drunk on a Saturday night.  Pretty much slept all through Sunday (no cigarettes).  Then, Monday morning, I decided not to buy a pack.  Haven't bought one since.  Cold turkey ftw.

Edit:This was awhile ago"Welbutrin and a desire to quit. Having a very attractive wife threaten to stop kissing you (among other things) was also a great motivator. Left my Ex.  Has been smooth sailing ever since."Getting two upper respiratory lung infections in a row was motivation enough. I still had a hard time quitting but I knew I had to. I don't really recommend doing this but it worked for me. I started smoking dokha. Its kind of tobacco pipe that is popular in Dubai. So its rare. When I ran out of the tobacco made for it, I couldn't find any in my home city. I tried to smoke cigs again but they tasted so awful, I couldn't even take a 2nd drag. and the rest is history. I'm not advising you to do this, its just the way I managed to quit. Good Luck! ""My mother got cancer, it shit me up. ""A buddy told me to do this and it worked, I hope it helps you:

-I smoked about seven-fold what i would in a normal day, and literally forced myself to oversmoke so much that i got sick with cough fits, phlem, chest pains, and dizziness for about 3 days. I had successfully made myself completely repulsed and sickened by the thought or smell of tobacco and never looked back since. At that point i hated smoking as much as i did and couldn't make myself stop. Good luck to any of you going through the same."4mg generic Nicorette. 170 pieces - $31.00 at Walmart.com. You get used to it and I have been addicted to them for 5 years now. I pray it doesn't turn out that they give you cancer as well!"I smoked easily a pack a day for like 6 years and, after ""quitting"" multiple times, the only thing that makes it work is your own desire to quit. Cold turkey is the most effective method, because ""weening"" yourself off of addictive substance abuse is just nonsense. The only way to get your brain to stop craving a chemical is by not giving it that chemical *and then sacking the fuck up when it starts to throw a hissy fit about it*. Trust me, the ""bad part"" is roughly day 2-5 and then the edge starts to die down a bit. If you can make it through a week, the worst is over and within another week you're past craving the chemical part of the addiction.  The last hump to get over is training yourself not to smoke during the physical addiction queues like driving or drinking, for instance.

If you still like to smoke, and want to smoke, that's a mindset you need to change. Quitting is the easiest thing in the world when you can *truthfully* say to yourself ""I no longer wish to smoke anymore because it's an expensive bad habit that is literally killing me in the process. It has absolutely no up-side.""""pretty much cold turkey, I never weaned myself down. i never said ""i'm quitting"" or told people I was. I just told myself i'm not gonna smoke any ciggarettes today, every day.""Dude. I just one day stopped being addicted to smoking I don't know why or how, I just stopped. Addiction is for life. Being a smoker is part of who I am. To quit is to give up who you are. Truth is, you'll be unhappy, smoker or not. I like the taste of tobacco and think its a great activity. I binge smoke from time to time but for the most part I quit. Smokers and ex smokers are miserable judgemental people. Don't listen to them, listen to yourself. You're not addicted to the chemical you're addicted to a lifestyle, you're addicted to yourself. So embrace it and love it. ""In a month I'll have 2 years behind me. It was  the first time in my life that I lived somewhere that no one else smoked and that made a huge difference.  I used the patch for a couple weeks but it ended up making me sick so I quit that too. (I don't know where you live but in Canada we have a smoking cessation program where you can get free gum and patches if you call 911 - the nurse hotline.) The reason I didn't go back to smoking was that my fiancÌ© had quit too and I didn't want to be the one spending our money on something that would kill me. We are low income so it made me feel really guilty even thinking about it. I'm not gunna lie, I think about cigarettes daily. But my son and fiancÌ© keep me on track without even knowing it. 
"I got pregnant. :/I was in the hospital for long enough for the effects of addiction to wear off. Kinda lucky cause I could not summon the willpower for cold turkey."Cold turkey is the only way.  I quit while my wife continued to smoke.  She didn't even realize for a week until we were almost out and she asked me to get more and I told her that she had to buy her own.  There are a couple things that will help.

1.  Quit on a Tuesday, by the time the weekend gets here the cravings were lessened.
2.  Have a plan.  Everything you are going to do for the next couple weeks, play games, go to movies, keep busy!
3.  Snacks!  Peanuts, cashews, almonds, jerky, carrots, anything that is easy to stick in your mouth.  You can get the weight off later.  Large meals are a trigger.
4.  Drink water and I mean lots of water.  Try and avoid soda and especially alcohol.

Good luck!
"After reading some posts and looking back at my experience I would have to say that u really have to want to quit. U have to accept that it is going to be hard and not use the excuse of how difficult it is to continue smoking. Quitting fucking sucks. That's the truth. What u r feeling is no different than what anyone else feels and it is no reason for u to light one up. I tried to quit countless times only to fail after each one. But u get to the point where u say to urself that this isn't a game and I have to be serious about this. Get rid of any cigarettes in ur house. Get rid of the smell. Try to separate urself from others who smoke or at least at the actual time that they r smoking. Live ur new smokeless life because that's what u have now. It's like when people say they r on a diet and always fail. It's not a diet it's a new lifestyle that they r now living. That's how u have to look at it"I smoked until I got really sick. A few times. Eventually, the thought of a sweet Camel Blue (lights at the time) made me sick to my stomach. That's what I recommend for anyone trying to quit."I have tried everything from being hypnotized to cold turkey gum patches etc. I just got into vaping. Not your typical e-cig from the gas station. Find a shop that sells liquid etc. After one week of smoking a pack a day I stopped. The taste is so good I just lit a CIG and couldn't even smoke it because it was so gross! Do it now!"Running did it for me.  It was hard to get going, but each run was an investment. Every cigarette was counter productive to my goal and really illustrated how much damage I was inflicting on my self.""It was very tough for me, the key is to keep trying, I think it took me 6 or 7 tries to finally kick the habbit for good, it also takes time for it to sink in just how damaging smoking is to your health.

I did use nicorette gums, which helped tremendously because it removes your physical craving, but most likely you'll become addicted to the gum instead afterwards, which is still better than smoking I guess, some people just go on the rest of their lives being nicorette addicts instead, again, still beats smoking.

If it's your first couple times trying to quit, you will most likely fail, the key is to not beat yourself up for it, just try again at a later date, you probably have been smoking for a very, very long time, it takes a couple of tries to get it right! I look at it this way, practice makes perfect.

Same thing with relapse, if it happens it happens, don't dwell on it, just pick yourself back up and try again. If you need help from some form of smoking cessation aids, use them. From my personal experience, it's hell of a lot easier to give up nicorette than quitting smoking!

One last thing, even after long periods of not smoking, you might still occasionally get the sudden craving out of nowhere, remind yourself that the craving is ONLY TEMPORARY AND WILL PASS EVENTUALLY, and just distract yourself with some other activities very quickly.

Good luck my friend! A life as a non-smoker is so much better than a smoker! Once you quit, you realize just how much freedom you give up for being a smoker! You no longer have to plan your days around your smoke breaks, you don't have to worry about meetings run long or being stuck on a long flight, you no longer have to ""case the joint"" when you get to a new place to look for the smoking spot, I can go on and on about how nice it is to remove the shackles of nicotine, but these are things you will have to find out for yourself."The patch and my wife threatening to leave me if I didn't quit."Where did the term ""cold turkey"" originate from?""Vanity.  I've got a wrinkle on my upper lip from all the puckering up to inhale.  It's been 3 years since I kicked the habit and probably my 4th or 5th attempt.  Just don't quit quitting, you can do it.""""Cig-a-like"" eCigarettes, the kind you buy at the gas station, are pretty much junk.  I suggest you get into more advanced eCigs mods, preferably regulated mods, rebuildable atomizers and even eventually start to make your own eLiquid.  It's a bit of a learning curve, but once you get into it you'll be kicking yourself for not doing it sooner.

Head on over to [**r/electronic_cigarette**](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette).  Great community, tons of helpful advice.  You'll do well.""My boyfriend , my cousin and my brother all quit using vapor cigs. Not ones that look like actual cigarettes,like blu, those my boyfriend tried and it didn't work for him. My brother went to a place called monster vape and had quit. My boyfriend tried it since it worked for my brother, he hadn't smoked for almost a year now. Told my cousin and now she's smoke free. ""Growing a beard. Smelled like smoke even more. Transitioned slowly to e cigs starting 3-4 years ago. Once the technology caught up, I quit cigs all together. Now I vape 0 nicotine as a hobby. Over one year with no cigs.""I used e-cigarettes to quit.  Haven't smoked in over a year now and i barely ever touch my e-cig anymore. I also took up running, running helps you stay smoke free about as much as the e-cig helped.""A coworker of mine had the hardest time quitting smoking...

...until one day, when she got sick and was throwing up.
Every time she would puke, she would take a drag from a cigarette.

After that she completely lost the urge to smoke again.
I don't smoke but I thought it was completely brilliant. 
""State of Minnesota increased tobacco tax by nearly $2/pack. Also nicotine patches. Also the terrible family history of heart disease and lung cancer. I'm almost a year into it and rarely even think about smoking anymore. 

Motivation is the only real way to quit smoking IMO. ""First and foremost you must have the desire to actually quit! You have to have that want factor! Otherwise at the first sight of stress or other triggers youÛªll pick it right back up. 

I found that the patches work great at getting rid of the nicotine cravings, but the daily routines like a smoking after eating, drinking coffee in the morning or driver is what was a little tough to kick. 

I changed my routines a little bit around and have been smoke free for 6 weeks! 

FYI I smoked for 13 years. 

Good luck! It's hard but it can be kicked!

""I've been cigarette free for 2 years.  Cold turkey.  The hardest part was driving and being around friends who smoke.  For driving I cut straws to the size of cigs and used them for a while.  The friends thing, well you have to just have will power because your friends are gonna smoke.
""When I quit, I wasn't planning on it. A couple friends were quitting and I was asked by them if I wanted in. I said screw it. So we decided to see who could last the longest. Things that helped me. I was already smoking a lot of pot at the time, so when I got a craving, I would smoke a bowl or joint. Oral fixation taken care of. I also played a lot of Battlefield 3 to keep my mind off of it. Also work kept me busy enough. Bam! A distraction. Ok, so the tricky part. How to handle all the times you would normally be smoking. After eating, after smoking a bowl, after a stressful situation, with coffee, etc. I had to consciously tell myself I didn't need a smoke. Also weed helped again. After about a month of being focused, I didn't feel the need to smoke anymore. So I quit smoking weed. I had to do one last test. The last time I had quit, I started back up do to drinking. I bought three talk cans and pounded them. I was lit and I didn't want to smoke. Success! My friends still smoke though. Oh well. Now, this worked for me. Everyone is different. The basic lesson is there. Cover oral fixation. Distract yourself/keep busy. Stay focused. You have to want to quit too. I didn't expect to quit, but I had wanted to quit for a long time. Just need the proper push I guess. Oh, I quit cold turkey. The weening thing doesn't work for me.

I tried quitting probably 30-40 times utilizing everything out there, patch, gum, pills, plastic whistles and nothing even remotely worked.  The longest I had quit was 3 days.  I have a pretty addictive personality and very little self restraint or willpower.  I give into my urges rather easily so the effort of trying to quit was almost futile. Then I tried a product called Quest cigarettes which was a program where there was 3 types of cigarette levels and each level had a different amount of nicotine.  1 was basically a Marlboro Light, 2 was an Ultralight and 3 had almost no nicotine at all like .005% I believe.  It took awhile to get used to a light coming from Camels but it took about 3 months on step 1 to be able to move to step 2 and that took two months and step 3 was 2 months as well.  The beauty of it was I smoked whenever I wanted and as much as I wanted.  If I had the urge to smoke I did, I didn't beat myself up about it.  My mind slowly leveled out at each level and I can still remember tossing the last cigarette I ever smoked.  As I tossed it on the ground to put it out I remember thinking how I had absolutely no urge to smoke anymore.  Than two weeks later I was sitting in a bar with two people who were smoking and I had no urge at all even after a few drinks.  That was 9 years ago and I have had zero urges since.  Too bad they discontinued Quest in 2010 it was a magical product.""You wanna quit? Easy. As in ""Alan Carr's the easy way to stop smoking"". I used it, and have stopped smoking now for over 4years. Give it a go, it even comes in audio book. ""It sounds stupid but I just stopped little by little. I didn't restrict myself from it. I cut back more and more and eventually it started to taste so bad and make me feel so bad I didn't want to do it anymore. If I smoke one now I feel like shit for hours. So just cut back more and more until it grosses
 you out... If you love smoking and it will never be gross to you. I'm not sure I can help then. "one word. spliffs "This is probably going to be buried but here goes. One night I got hammered and cigarettes, when you are are drunk, are like crack for a crackhead. Bought a pack of cigs at a local 7-11 and started chatting n smoking with some buddies outside a bar. Thought I had a pretty good night, didn't remember much (always the sign of a good night, right?). I woke up the next morning, and barely could speak. My throat was basically destroyed. Looked in my pocket and there was an empty pack of cigs. Turns out I smoked the whole pack in about 3 hours. Luckily nothing bad that was long term came out of it but now when I think of the taste of cigs I feel like throwing up. 

TLDR: Buy a pack of cigs and smoke them all in 3 hours. ""This is not really going to be helpful for anyone, but what worked for me was being in the hospital. I went in for what was supposed to be a minor surgery but I ended up having to stay there for over a month. I was in a lot of pain most of the time and even if anyone had let me do so, I wouldn't have been capable of going outside for a smoke. I was sort of forced to quit, as it was really my only option, and the pain meds I was on got me through any withdrawals, I guess.""- stop buying cigarettes.
- stop going outside for smoke breaks, even if it means being ""antisocial""

- if you work in a clinic or hospital, keep taking your ""smoke breaks"" but instead go for a walk.""Electronic cigarettes. Started with the blu's, and then I picked up an ego pen. I smoked on an off for a year, and then I invested in a more expensive, long term electronic cigarette. Since then I haven't smoked more than a drunken cigarette or two, in about a year. I started smoking heavily at 16, and I'm 25 now. "I had also heard that if you have access to a sauna you should go for two days after you quit to sweat out the nicotine in your system and that it really helps with cravings and overall follow through."I started smoking in 1993 and I was a pack and a half a day smoker by the time I quit in 2008. I used all three steps of the Nicoderm CQ patches as directed and that helped with the nicotine cravings. As far as the oral fixation part of smoking...I smoke a ton of pot. As soon as I got out of work I would smoke a joint or bowl and would continue to smoke pot throughout the day. As I moved on to steps 2 and 3 of the Nicoderm patches I also cut down on the weed smoking considerably, to the point where I was only smoking one or two bowls a day during step 3 of the patches. Once I was done with the patches I also stopped smoking weed for a year or so. Fast forward to 2014 and I am still tobacco free, though I still enjoy the occasional toke. 

I know all I did was substitute one vice for another, and this method of quitting smoking cigs won't work for everyone for various reasons. But it worked for me. ""I quit cold turkey. I think my decision was made, and the opportunity just came with another cold in the middle of winter. 

My decision was made because 

1/ I reflected for some time on why I was smoking (what happened in my mind when I lit a cig) and did not like the weakness and fear I saw there in me,      

2/ babies were born in my family, I felt the love I had for them, and refused to give them a bad example, or leave them early, 

3/ maybe least importantly, I did not feel like giving money to the cigarette makers

PS: surprisingly enough (or not), it's been two summers I have started again smoking for the duration of festivals (5-7 days), enjoyed it thoroughly, and quit with no issue at the gate when leaving.""After 2 failed legitimate attempts (took Zyban both those times), I took a course called ""X-smokers"". It's basically a behaviour-modification/brainwashing set of in-person sessions. 8 weeks in length, you smoke for the first 5 weeks, then the last 3 weeks are the non-smoking weeks. Worked great and never looked back. They teach you about how your body reacts to cigarettes and and the whole physical side of it. They also teach you about how the nicotine addiction isn't really all that strong, and it's mostly just the psychological addiction.

The keys to the course for me was that they immediately make you change the cigarettes you're used to smoking, then they start breaking what you most closely associate with smoking. First thing they took away was coffee & cigarettes. You could still have your smoke and coffee, but you could no longer have them simultaneously. Then they introduce ""control times"". You want to have a smoke after that nice big meal? Nope, wait 10 minutes, then smoke. You wanna have a smoke with that beer? Nope, wait 10 minutes after you're done that drink, then smoke (this was HUGE - you end up wanting a to have that next drink instead of waiting to have a cigarette). The control times get longer and longer as you go through the course. Then you start to break the ties with all the things you associate with smoking.

Yes, the first couple of days after you stop smoking are difficult, but you are given the techniques to deal with it. Also, from the beginning of the course you are told to keep all your cigarette buts in a see-through glass jar. Pretty gross, but you get to see what you were doing to yourself.

I quit in November of 2006 and haven't looked back. No desire to start again either.

Good luck.""Wanting to.

And cold turkey.  Quit for a few weeks after finally, FINALLY deciding I wanted/needed to.  Lapsed and tried one, but after the few weeks had passed, it made me feel sick.  So I put it down, and never lit up again.  I don't even get the urges anymore....not even when drinking, which surprises me."Standing on the porch of my apartment in only shorts when it was below freezing trying to get a quick smoke in. Then I realized how fucking stupid it was and quit cold turkey. 12 years later I still would kill someone for a smoke. I suppose that is why I have a food addiction problem I need to work on as well. Only prob is I can't quit food cold turkey. "Quitting for just today. I would tell myself each and every day that I was just quitting for today, and that if I made it through, I could smoke tomorrow. After the first 3-4 days of stringing together this psychological lie, I found myself craving cigarettes less and less, to the point where I didn't want them any more. 

Truth be told, if I'm out drinking and someone offers me a smoke, I may take a couple drags from it, but I haven't had a whole cigarette to myself in more than a year.

That, and smell your fingers after you smoke. It would make me gag everytime. Ew."Cold turkey. Decided i wanted to stop and just stopped. Havent looked back."my wife (28) and I (30) were planning to have kids.  So we quit cold turkey.  It stuck, and we haven't looked back in 13 years.  There are some mitigating factors.

We both smoked less than a pack a day, although if we went out drinking or partying I at least could smoke a pack in an evening.  
We live in Canada and at the time, Marlboro Lights cigarettes were still unavailable for sale legally in Canada.  I bought all of my ML's as contraband usually via a couple of stores in Toronto's Chinatown neighbourhood.  Occasionally the government's antismuggling efforts would be successful and the supply would be limited, and eventually the cigarettes would be the proverbial bottom of the barrel, meaning they would turn stale very quickly after opening a pack.  
I hated the taste of other cigarettes, so switching to another brand wasn't possible for me.  
The end result of the scarcity, staleness and being locked into a single brand meant that I essentially weaned myself off cigarettes because the experience had become so unpleasant to me that I smoked less and less until I just stopped.
In my wife's case, she just stopped and didn't start again.  She told me she never liked smoking much to begin with so she didn't find it difficult.  
Obviously our circumstances won't line up with everyone else's. But in our case the formula was motivation (cleaning up before conceiving a child and being healthier in general), and opportunity for me, via the poisoned well of my cigarette supply.  

I highly recommend the stale cigarette thing btw.  Open all your packs and just let them sit.  Over time they'll be less and less pleasant to smoke.  It could help.""A. Don't give upÛÓeven after ""cheating""
B. Cold turkey is the only way to goÛÓramping down is still smoking
C. Decide to not be a smokerÛÓyou have to retool yourself to dislike the smell, the feelings of it, etc.

There is no magic bullet. It takes diligence. Trust me, I still crave them no and again (and even cheat), but with the three things above I have quit.
""When you feel a craving coming on, tighten your lips together and inhale deeply a few times. Don't take actually take a breath, just let a little air slip in through your closed mouth. This mimics the way inhaling cigarette smoke deprives oxygen to your lungs and tricks the brain into feeling like you took a puff. You may even feel a bit light headed like when you light up after not having a smoke for a long time. This technique was told to me by a doctor years ago and has worked for myself and others I've mentioned it to. ""You have to have some self control and a will to quit. There's nothing else. I decided one day that I wanted to taste again and not wake up feeling like I had a cold. Haven't had a cigarette in 3 years. 

If you've tried to quit and failed its because you want to fail, nothing more. Good luck on the next attempt. I really want you to quit as well, random stranger."E-Cigs.....three years with out a real cigarette now"Cold turkey 8 years ago with my wife. We both quit and went though it together. We leaned on each other during the cravings, and having some one else helped us pull through. ""I just quit. One night I had my last cigarette from the pack and decided not to buy more the next day. Made it ok the entire day then went and got absolutely hammered. I could smell the smoke coming in from outside and really wanted one. I told myself no and my friends/support system said no. From that day on I knew that if I could be that shitfaced and not need a cigarette, then I wouldn't need it anymore. ""Common sense
"I quit during a bad bout of bronchitis.  I simply couldn't smoke while I was sick.  It took me a month to get over it.  By then I was past the physical withdrawal effects.  For a while I'd bum a cigarette every so often while I drank.  Then that tapered off as I pretty much stopped drinking.It's not easy. I quit smoking by telling myself in my head every time I took a drag of a cigarette that this tastes awful. It might've been two months maybe three but eventually the cigarette actually did start tasting awful and I didn't want to smoke anymore and that's when I knew it was time to quit. And then once I quit I didn't smoke that's the hardest part don't smoke no matter what happened. If your girlfriend breaking up with you don't smoke if you're eating a great steak don't smoke after word. Oh and the cravings will be there you know that it really strong at certain points seven days is a really strong craving 15 days is a really strong craving 30 days is a huge craving and then even at six months any year every now and then I still had really big craving but just don't smoke and don't have them anywhere around you. When I quit I was working in a bar where you could smoke and being offered three packs of cigarettes so one day all the sudden for me to stop quitting is probably the hardest it could've ever been. Good luck and just with every half of that cigarette tell yourself how much you think it tastes terrible or you hate the tape or this tape awful anything to just start convincing yourself that it doesn't taste good.  And maybe start smoking weed"I'm not a smoker, but my uncle was. He worked as a military engineer, so a lot of travelling in his youth, a lot of stresses, and a lot of work. Naturally, smoke was his close friend.

Not until he fell ill, about 20 years ago. I didn't ask him what did he contracted, but he said during that time feeling ill on bed, the smell and the taste of smoke turned, as he described, disgusting. I guess smoke was too bad for him that he has been a non-smoker ever since.""I smoked for 12yrs im 2yrs quit right now, my personal opinion has always been cold turkey is the best, and you can only truly quit if YOU want to quit. I failed a few times and I realized I didn't want to quit because I didn't like smoking I wanted to quit because my parents and friends told me it was bad for me so I should want to quit, it fooled me into thinking I wanted to quit, but in reality I never truly wanted to stop, I just wanted everyone to stop hassling me about it and easiest way was to say ""im trying to quit"". Really I would say that and then just look for a time when I could smoke and nobody would see me. It has to be you that wants to truly quit smoking to do it, you have to hate everything about it, the detriment to your health, the cost, the having to go outside on a cold rainy day and you have to decide all the crap is worse than the enjoyment of having a smoke. Once you reach the point where you're getting no enjoyment anymore only gradually more pissed off at everything smoking is taking away from you, thats when its time to start quitting.""Really it's a state of mind. I had made excuses, e.g. 'after this pack', etc. for years. I had tried to stop several times previously without success. I was off work for 2 weeks sick and just thought 'now's the time'. I didn't go out socially for those 2 weeks. I did use patches but they were uncomfortable and I'm not sure how much they really helped. The main thing was the realisation that smoking had become the master of me and I did not want to be a slave. It got easier after a couple of months but I know that I can NEVER smoke again or I will be back where I started.""I began by extending the time between buying a new pack and each individual cigarette. Even if at first it was only a few hours between a cigarette that was a small win. Each pack I would push further and further from the last. At the point I could make it 2 or 3 days between is when I started to notice the awful cigarette smell and taste again. Extending the time between packs at the end could be an entire week at a time and that made the smell, taste and choking unbearable. Experiencing that grossness enough times was enough for me to take the final step of just not buying anymore. It took maybe 6-8 months after my last pack for random urges to completely disappear. I tried cold turkey from a pack a day several times but failed every time. ""Have you tried Vaping?  I switched from traditional cigarettes over 6 months ago and have not looked back since.  You can get a pretty cheap setup for under 100 bucks or even just pickup a disposable e-cigarette like Blu or Njoy.  I realize it's giving up one habbit for another, but I personally feel 1000 times better than when I smoked traditional analog cigarette's.  Good luck to you sir!

Edit: sorry, just read the last bit of your post.  It's not easy to switch to e-cigs, by a long shot, but after 2-3 days the cravings start to go away.  I would recommend getting something with the highest nicotine level you can find.  24mg worked for me.  Now I'm at 12 and lowering it a bit every couple months.""I quit buying cigarettes. 

For a little while I blagged fags off my mates while I was drinking. Yeah, it was dickish, so I'd only ask for one or two instead of five or ten. 

Eventually that was one. Now I refuse ones that are offered. Social pressure is a useful tool! ""I smoked for over two years (not long, I know) but my wife had been a smoker for about five or so. One day we were driving back to the house, smoking our cigarettes and I said, ""This is my last cigarette."". She decided that it would be her last cigarette too. That was 4 months ago. We quit 100% cold turkey and I think it's the best way.

One of the biggest helps for us is that we had each other, and we both wanted to quit. Another thing that helped tremendously, and this may sound counter-productive, but we kept our cigarettes around. We knew exactly where they were and could light up at any point if we chose to. I think we both took comfort in that. We never actually smoked them and eventually threw them away.

The first few weeks is the hardest, everything you do you associate with doing it while smoking. On break at work, smoke. Just ate? Smoke.
Just woke up? Smoke. etc, etc. The goal is not to simply quit smoking, but learn to not associate all of your daily activities with it as well.



I wish you the best of luck and hope you find the strength to quit. I literally have no cravings for them and notice how awful they smell on other people. Just do it cold turkey, that's the best way in my opinion.""I quit 10 months ago using electronic cig.  a good quality ecigarette and the right flavor is all you need.  Stay away from the drug store crap and get tou a nice one that works.  Spend some time finding a good liquid that suits you and going back to real cigs will make you feel instantly sick.  I use the itaste mvp2 battery, iclear 16 clearomizer, and get all my liquid from  indigo vapor.  I couldnt be forced to smoke another cigarette this thing is so good.""Pregnancy.  Seriously, the second I found out I stopped.  When I wanted one I would go online and read about all the terrible things smoking does to a fetus and it would make me feel guilty for even thinking about it.  That was a year and a half ago.  I sometimes want to smoke, especially after large meals, but thinking about touching my kid with my smoke hands and breathing my smoke breath on her makes me sad.  And she does everything I do.  EVERYTHING, and it would break my heart to see her pretend smoking :("[deleted]"I smoked half a pack a day for about 5 years. 

Cold turkey with change of everyday habits is the only way.  Since smoking is a habit, you'll need to start changing the everyday things that remind you of smoking. 

For instance: I would always have a cigarette at the entrance door to my office building.  So instead of going that way, I would purposely enter the building through the side door.  

I also smoked after lunch.  So to kick that habit, I would take a quick walk afterwards.

Try to stay away from your friends that smoke. I would avoid drinking alcohol for a few weeks. 

Avoid asking strangers for cigarettes."Cancer"I just quit.  I was ready after 15 years of smoking.  I used some cinnamon flavored toothpicks for a few weeks and it was great for the oral fixation but that was it.  I always tell people that unless you are ready to quit mentally,  there's no reason to try.  It's simply motivation and willpower.  Don't try it for anyone else but yourself.  Also, if you are not ready or do not really want to quit... don't try.  It's your life, be happy with who you are.  BTW:  I quit 13 years ago."Willpowerhttp://www.weighdown.com/   this site has classes teaching you how to stop any vise you could ever think of.   And it works."I stopped smoking. It worked. I simply said, ""I don't want to die from this shit"" ""What helped me was stages: Quit smoking in the car, then at home, and then at work. I still smoke occasionally when out with friends after a few adult beverages, but the key is I don't think about cigarettes and don't need cigarettes. Smoking is now a special occasion- a once-a-month kind of treat.""/r/electronic_cigarette

/r/Vaping101 ""It made me feel like shit to the point of making smoking unappealing.  Quitting the last time (most smokers quit many tikes, only to pick it back up) was easy because whatever craving of nicotine I had was offset by the sick feeling I have just thinking about smoking a cigarette.  Being winded all the time, having my heart flutter, the constant feeling of stress that high blood pressure gives you all were a direct result of my smoking.

It kind of makes me wonder if a clockwork orange style of aversion therapy would work, like smoking cigarettes with something that made you nautious.  Probably not, but basically the feeling horrible side of my smoking finally won out. ""The desire to quit first off, and the perspective after this video.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TL2Vh7goJc""I recently quit for the second time(a little over two weeks ago) but am feeling stronger this time. The first time I quit I quit cold turkey which lasted a good two months until I got drunk and hit a bumpy road in life, which I figured having just one cig wouldn't hurt. Stupid me. I started back up for another year or so until two weeks ago. This time, I quit smoking cigarettes and quit drinking all types of soda. I quit soda to clear up my face for acting head shots I'm getting done. I believe what really helped me quit easily this time was the fact that I had another addiction to focus on quitting and that let up on me thinking about cigarettes so much. I also used nicotine lozenges for a bit which helped initially but then I wore off them since I didn't want to grow a dependency. I also tried using smoker's patches which was a terrible idea since I threw up with the first patch, seriously don't try it unless you smoke like a motherfucker. Here are a couple other methods I've come across that may help you out.

- Exercise, sweat out the addiction

- Dip whatever cigs you have left in milk just enough so they can dry off within time, now every time you crave a cig, light up one of your milk-cigs. They will smell and taste absolutely repulsive and it should turn the idea of smoking into a bad image. 

- Distract the ""act of smoking"" with something healthier. Some smokers only smoke because they enjoy the act of putting something near their mouths. Replace it with something simple like chewing gum, drinking more water (what I did), chew on a straw, etc. 

- You mentioned your trigger is work, so was mine. Just find things to keep you busy around your work-place. I never stopped finding something to do in order to distract myself from going outside. Also, talk to your boss about getting breaks if you're a non-smoker, everyone is entitled to a break whether or not they smoke. It's ridiculous to say that only smokers can have a break just to feed their addictions. (I had the same problem in my workplace until I brought it up. 



You may have seen these methods before, I just wanted to show what worked well for me. Hope this helped you, best of luck in quitting...again!

Edit: Grammar""I was given an ultimatum by my now-husband. When we started getting really serious he told me he couldn't see himself being married to a smoker. He said that 1 of 3 things would happen: 

1) He would start smoking (not an option for me) 
2) We would break up (also not an option) 
3) I would quit smoking

I found something I wanted more than a cigarette, and that was him. I went cold-turkey. Having his support helped a lot, as did sucking on a peppermint whenever I had a craving (my mom swears by blow-pops).

""Honestly, I had just started dating this guy that I REALLY liked when my friend jokingly suggested we quit smoking together. He got so happy and said he hadn't wanted to say anything but he hated the taste and smell of smoke. Realizing that my habit was making him uncomfortable and not liking the idea of smelling/tasting bad, I just stopped. Every time I want a cigg I just imagine him about to kiss me and then getting discussed and hugging me instead. I haven't smoked in a year. ""Discipline. I decided to quit, but didn't throw away my last pack of smokes, it was probably half full. Kept it in my jacket for two months, knowing that I didn't quit due to lack of cigarettes, but due to my own will. This kept me strong enough to keep me from taking one and smoke it.

Oh, and exercise. Took up running. 4 years smoke free now!"I finished my last pack and then told myself how much money I was wasting on it and also how bad my health was getting. Whether you're old or young its never to late to give it up."I quit when my wife got pregnant. Cold turkey. That was 7years ago. I had tried unsuccessfully to quit the same way, even tried gum.. you just really have to want it.

My wife used the 3step nicoderm cq patches, but didn't finish with the final patches, just the first two, she's been cig free for about 3years now.

Sister has been smoke free for almost a year, also cold turkey. Dad quit about 4years ago, same.. mom quit about the time I did. Same way.

Gist of it is, you have to want it.. some people need a little extra jeep, using patches or gum or whatever, but if you don't want to quit, you won't.

With that said, there are still days that I go ""man, wish I had a smoke"" so don't miss yourself into thinking it will be easy to quit.

The best way to quit is to never start.

Edit: fixed some autocorrect issues."E-cigs for me. I was wanting to quit for years and one day my husband went into a vape shop and bought me an Ego Twist. He brought it home and I was upset that he spent $60 on all of it. In an effort to save money I told myself I would use it until I recouped the $60. Wound up loving it!! Over a year smoke free now."Aww look at all the guys in here from /r/stopsmoking. This isn't a bandwagon post or anything is it?

Get a real electronic cigarette, Something mechanical or at least variable voltage. Those shitty little ego devices don't give you enough throat hit or vapor and replacing the coil every day sucks ass.

I'm down to 6mg nicotine with ecigs and I can quit if I want but I'm not noticing any of the ill effects I got with tobacco and my respiratory health is 100% restored. Plus I like the effects of nicotine almost as much as caffeine.

I'm sure I'm going to get a bunch of naysayers but those people don't know what they're talking about and are engaging in confirmation bias to help prove to themselves that they aren't weak willed. ""I didn't smoke, but I used to chew fairly heavily for about a year. I just decided one day that I didn't like the chains that were around me, constantly having to have a can in my pocket, nicotine cravings if I didn't have any recently, etc, and I went cold turkey. There's an all natural, herbal chew out there that I used one can of and that was it. I was done.""I had a system to work with. My smoking was pretty much set to a schedule already - 1 on the way to work, 1 during the first break, 1 at lunch, etc. So each week, I would cut one from my schedule until I was down to not smoking at all. It was still difficult, but I felt like that system made the transition a lot less painful for me than it could have been.""I actually justÛ? quit.  Five years ago.  I smoked my last one, threw away the empty pack, and said ""I'm done.""  Haven't touched them since. ""2 years without a smoke and still going strong. I did it cold turkey, it was one of the hardest addiction to overcome. Find a good support group, have friendd help you out. It will take a lot of will power and the first 3 months are tough. Good luck!""I didn't smoke for as long as others, only like 4 or 5 years. Still was not easy to stop. 

I came home from work one day, and took a 20 minute cat nap. When I woke up, I felt like extreme shit. It was so weird, I was fine 20 minutes earlier. It turned out to be a 24 hour flu type sickness, and the last thing I want to do when I'm sick is smoke. So I decided I was not gunna smoke, and I just stuck to it when I got over the sickness. It has been over 2 years now since then. Now if only I can get my mom and brother to stop. ""I was lucky, because smoking was disgusting to start for me, i had to work through it, throw up, acquire a taste for it. 

Once i'd taught my body to like it, seriously, there was no hope in hell for me to quit, I was a solid pack and a half a day and I liked it, thought it was cool, felt naked, awkward and retarded to ever talk outside without one in my hand.  

One summer I lived at the bottom of a hill and I was lazy, i was also lonely for awhile, so nobody to mooch off.  After this depressing period of having to climb a mountain to get a smoke I couldn't afford, I dried out by accident.

Then I was back at college and I went outside with friends and took a puff and realized suddenly that it was gross - i needed to smoke, needed to have it in my hand, but fuck was it disgusting.  I realized i had gone long enough without it that I found it unpleasant.

So i had the choice to either smoke through the gross until I liked it again - or endure the terrible pointlessness of human hands without a smoke. 

So I fake smoked. I didn't light them. I still do it when drinking sometimes, its a funny gag with friends i guess.  People approach and try to light my smokes and I accept the offer but aim the cig away from the flame - 9 of 10 times they think they lit my smoke.  When they notice it's out again, I say it's okay, they last longer like this.""i said to myself that im stronger than this shit. whenever you get a craving, you have to decide, are you a pussy or are you stronger than this"Don't light one and smoke it.  That worked for me."I like to break it down into two phases:

1.  Break the physical habit of reaching for a smoke...carrying a pack, lighter and all of that wonderful stuff.  Do this by using nicotine replacement.  I like the lozenge because it delivers a steady drip of nicotine and satisfies the oral fixation stuff.  This is the easy part (you will still want a good old smoke, but it's tolerable after a week or so).

2.  This is the hard part.  Reduce the number and dose of the lozenges and then quit cold turkey.  The physical withdrawal is awful.  I felt like little people were scratching my eyes from the inside.  Terrible sleep, edgy, etc.  If you can make it for a month you should be golden, but the urge to smoke never totally goes away. 

It's worth it if you can get to the other side.  Best of luck.  ""Quit cold turkey and started running.

This introduced an immediate consequence for any cigarette I smoked. I'm not sure if it's a physiological thing or perhaps even purely psychological, but when I would smoke a cigarette on a Friday night, I could FEEL it during my run on Sunday.""after several false starts,exercise,exercise,exercise. In fact I just don't think it is possible without it.every time you want a cig drop and do 20 push ups,or body weight squats and sit ups,that plus a cardio of some sort is the only way i could beat it.also a very engaging piece of media for me i played mass effect 1 and 2 back to back for 2 weeks,I think binge watching a awesome netflix show would be just as good.""I wish more replies like the one I am going to make were higher up.. quitting cold turkey is definitely one of the hardest ways to quit (imo) and not that effective at all. I mean hell, I tried to quit my PAD Marlboro Red habit cold turkey a few times over the years, and I always ""relapsed"" due to some stressful situation or lack of willpower.

On August 6th, 2013 I bought a vaporizer. Within a week I found cigarettes to smell and taste horribly. My PAD habit has turned in to ZERO a day, my sense of smell and taste returned, my lungs feel better, and my wallet loves me.

Now I get to vape basically wherever I want, whenever I want, using whatever flavor I want, and not bothering anyone at all or really harming myself. Not only that, I have drastically lowered my nicotine intake. In August I was using eJuice that contained 18mg/ml of nicotine. Now I use 6mg/ml."I never started. Worked like a mother fucking charm. AH HA HA HA HA HA!"Cold turkey, because my girl hated it.  8 years, and I just stopped."Will power and choices."I actually wanted to stop smoking, so I did. ""Lived abroad, got paid shit, adopted a puppy, roommate ditched me. Could either afford to pay rent on my own and buy the cigs, or pay rent on my own and buy food and pay vet bills for the puppy.

Not the ones that look like cigarettes, the good ones. check out [electronic_cigarette!](http://reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette)""I can only go by personal experience. I smoked for over 25 years. I probably started around age 14 -16. The reason being it was what peers were doing. And at the time, It was socially acceptable - enough that adverts were still dominate. I always told myself that I'd never smoke when I was a kid. HA!

I didn't really take notice of the addiction side of smoking until I hit rough times in my 20's. By then I was already smoking a pack a day. It really starts to bother you when you find yourself digging into ashtrays to smoke butts left by other people and/or are bumming cigarettes more than you can afford to buy them for yourself and pissing those people off, that have the same ""habit"".

Even when I didn't have a job, I never made any serious attempts to quit. Oh sure, I would cut down - even as far down as 5 cigarettes a day, but that was mainly because I ""had no choice"". It was my private ball and chain for years.

Recently I noticed something. More accurately, I was missing something that I remembered of my youth. It was practically a nostiglosia  moment for me. When I was a kid, environments were often remembered with scent. How come I don't smell my surroundings now? How come I don't smell that fresh pine? Fall leaves? stomped grass?

It was all because I killed my nose with smoking, and suddenly wanted it back. Oh I did have a smokers cough in the morning sometimes. and my phlegm was a nice tint of brown. More often than not I always had a stuffy nose - filled with more brown gunk. 

None of this mattered though. I was still very hooked. Just another day. Another pack. Another $.$$ out of my wallet. Whatever the price happened to be. 

3 months ago I was browsing reddit as usual and decided to linger in /r/stopsmoking . At the time I was also going through my usual cutting back routine. Someone happened to mention Allen Carr and his book and I decided to take a look out of curiosity. 

What I learned was that I was telling myself incredibly complex lies to excuse and continue my smoking ""habit"". Habit? no. ADDICTION!
In fact its as bad or worse than any other addicted drug. Cutting back is ridiculous. Going from 5 to 1 is surely going to help right? Wrong. You're still getting your 'fix' - just delayed.

Allen Carr's book helped me put those lies to rest and gave me a way to think about smoking while quitting. But I'll warn you here. There's quite a bit of controversy over his book. Some people expect it to be a magic trick or hypotonus. Or think it's too cultish. 90% of his book also  appears to be a bunch of flabber mouthing nonsense - and probably is. Whether or not this was intentional or pure book filler is up for grabs. The truth is that it's no more than a fact book, with tips on what to expect. 

While most methods will push you in ice cold water and let you sink, Carr's book teaches you to slide in and realize it was never that cold to  begin with. 

I'm happy to say I've not touched a cigarette in 3 months. I can smell again. Can now jog 3 miles. And I'm confident I'll never touch another cigarette.

I quit cold turkey.Just go cold turkey and thug the pain of withdrawal like a man. And run a lot."My wife and I were about to have a kid. After ten years of a pack a day habit, and trying unsuccessfully in the past to ""smoke in moderation"", I just stopped. Cold turkey, no magic bullet. 

It was tough at first, but then all things are I suppose. I was just at a point where it no longer made sense for me personally, financially, or emotionally to continue smoking. Just over three years now, and I haven't touched a cigarette since. You can't ""cheat just once"", because that isn't how addiction works. E-cigs (and other devices) are bullshit enablers that allow you to bargain with yourself (whenever I say this the friggin pitchfork brigade of apologists storm my inbox... so, I'm ready for that).

It gets easier, and in the end, you will be (most likely) really glad that you are no longer an addict.""My boyfriend used an herb called Kratom. It effects the same neurotransmitters that nicotine does so it almost 'replaces' it and gives the user a chance to have relief from an assortment of symptoms. He was no longer depressed, anxious and could re-learn how to do everything much easier. He's been smoke free for 14 months now! ""What worked for me: The patches. Started with the strongest ones as I smoked a pack a day. Great dreams! But anyways it was hard that first week. Honestly I drank a lot. Not beer, because what goes together better than a beer and a cig. Straight shots. I would get pretty beligerant and pass out. But after a week or so I started forgetting about holding the cig. Then I started getting nicotine overdoses from the patches. Started feeling really weird. So I stepped down. Then I realized wtf, I don't need these at all! And 8 years later here we are

What worked for me was the motivation not to pollute my wife and kids combined with aversion therapy. A weekend blow out which involved copious amounts of drinking and smoking and resulted in a week long hangover.

Fell asleep for eighteen hours. Woke up without a craving, never smoked another cigarette.

For me, it was mostly the cold, and laziness. At some point I looked up and realized I couldn't smoke in my apartment. Couldn't smoke in the office. Didn't want to stand there in the freezing cold to smoke. Friends were complaining about the smell in my car, plus the cold. 

I counted the cigarettes I was smoking each day. Started at maybe eight (I was never a real big smoker). Got rid of the pain-in-the-ass ones, like where you're standing outside of the building or having to go downstairs. Then I got rid of the habitual ones, like the every-time-I-get-in-the-car ""I didn't even really want this"" cigarettes. 

So now I'm down to the gotta-have-a cigarettes. The moments of high-stress, at the end of a night of drinking, after a big meal. I don't not smoke cigarettes, but I smoke maybe 20 cigarettes a month.

I broke my neck and the doctor essentially refused to operate if I didn't promise to quit.  Also the nurses refused to wheel me downstairs to smoke.

Makes you have the most vivid dreams ever if you put a fresh one on at night.Smoked for 25 years. Read Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking and never looked back. I liked that it encouraged me to continue smoking while I read. I also liked it because it appealed to my way of thinking about addiction and gave me mental tools to cope with quitting. While any way of quitting is acceptable as long as you quit. This book details why using gums and other nicotine supplements only make it harder."Cold Turkey, Quit almost 3 years ago. I have had a few smokes(like maybe 5~6 in 3 years) when drinking. Hookah occasionally when my roommates use it. I did abstain from tobacco for 2 years before I did either one of those. Neither one makes me run out and buy a pack. I wouldn't recommend it though. Quitting was the best thing I ever did.""I stopped craving it during the day, so that part was easy. I still craved it when I was drunk, so for about two years I only smoked when I was drunk. Then I chain-smoked with a friend of mine during a drunk night, and was sick for two weeks afterwards with a cold and bad cough. Haven't gotten a craving since then. 

I'm aware that this isn't actually a method of quitting. My mom smoked for years, and one day just stopped wanting it and quit, too.

EDIT: I also never had the hard time dealing with the craving that everyone talks about. The only times I wanted a cigarette was when a routine came up that I used to smoke during, such as driving, during a good song, etc.""Probably not available to you, but for me, it was Demerol that was the key to my ability to quit. Surgery complications meant that I had about a two-week supply of Demerol for pain, and I'm convinced that's what got me through the worst of the physical withdrawals. After that, it was just one day at a time, like AA. I'd wake up and say to myself, ""Just for today, you're not going to smoke."" And I did that every single day until it was no longer necessary. That was 15 years ago, and now I'm one of those obnoxious, rabid non-smokers who has zero tolerance for the smell. ""I quit one situation at a time. First, I quit smoking in my bathroom. Then I quit smoking in my living room. Then I quit smoking in my kitchen. Then I quit smoking in my office. Then I quit smoking everywhere but outside. Then I quit smoking outside. ""Chantix. That drug face me the worst insomnia and nightmares, and I only took it for four days. With every craving that hits, I see the blood dropping off my child's arm in that dream and vomit. No more smoking for me. ""/ragequit, first time I used that function in my brain for a positive outcome."The patch and a bad memory. "In my personal experience with quitting cigarettes, my friend and I decided that we both wanted to stop before we became adults and it had really settled into our lives. I was 17 at the time and had been smoking for about 3 years as well as my amigo. We both figured that the best way to do it was to chain smoke cigarettes until we couldn't smoke anymore. From that point on that was it, no more cigarettes. I think that having a friend doing it with me really encouraged me not to give up because I didn't want to be the weak one. 

I think the driving force to quit really has to be yourself. You have to say no every single time or else you're just giving in to your temptations. The use of nicotine supplements can only help so much before they leave you in denial that you have quit. Quitting cold turkey isn't for everyone, but being able to say no after your quit date is difficult but completely possible
"Cold turkey and will power. I went cold turkey BUT I bought an e - cig and used it when I was getting to the point of breaking down and buying a pack. I only used the e - cig about 5 times in total and I would only take a couple of puffs. I haven't smoked in 2 years now. Hope that helps. Good luck to you! I girlfriend told me it was gross. I couldn't argue it. I knew I had to quit at some point and it was rough at first since a lot of my friends smoke. Even made it despite them offering me cigarettes every once in awhile. I just had a streak going and once it was a few weeks I didn't want to break it. It's basically will power. I've seen so many people fail trying other methods. You have to want to be done. "I got the flu one winter and my throat was way too sore to smoke, it wasnt even an option.  10 days later when I was finally healthy I realized that I had ""quit"" almost two weeks ago.  I decided to go with it, having already been through the toughest days of quitting.  That was in 2001."I actually like smoking so it was hard for me to find an alternative. I use a vape pen with nicotine juice and flavoring. I went from a pack a day to not wanting one at all in less than 2 weeks. Interested? "Just stop buying them.  Form some kind of punishment if you violate the rule like donating the same amount of money you paid for the pack to charity.  While donating to charity is great, that money loss will get tiresome pretty quickly.  ""Innate cheapness and a monetary award. This worked for me about 20 years ago. I was smoking about a pack a day, spending five bucks a pack. I took a two-liter plastic bottle, and first thing each morning I put a $5 bill in the bottle and told myself, ""Well, can't buy smokes today - I already 'spent' my $5."" At the end of a year I sliced the bottle open - and rewarded myself with $1825.00 to spend however I wished. That nearly TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS that had been going (figuratively) up in smoke. The combination of a year to break the habit, the monetary reward,  and the realization of the waste of money did the trick for me; I haven't touched a cigarette since."i subscribed to /r/electronic_cigaretteHaving high blood pressure. It was either quit or have a massive stroke!"I used niquitin patches 24mg for 1st week, 2nd week 14mg and 3rd week 7mg worked perfectly I didn't need a cigarette at all been a non-smoker for 9months now.""I slowly cut back until I was at three or four smokes a day. Then, cold turkey. It was difficult, but I did it. ""I quit smoking over five years ago on my first attempt.  I was a fairly heavy smoker -- 20+ a day.  I smoked for 10 years. I quit by replacing my addiction with nicotine gum, which I chewed with varying levels of madness for about 3 years.  Finally, I transitioned from the gum to the patch and started chewing non-nicotine gum.  The key for me was taking the control out of my hands in terms of when the nicotine came into my system. It wasn't easy, and there is no one way to quit.  For me, focusing on increased physical activity was an important piece.  Ultimately you have to just stop being chickenshit and make a bold move.  Try a few different tactics. Some might not work at first. Keep trying.  Smoking is fucking corny.""Don't bring cigs outside with you. Just fucking go outside and take a 3 minute break. It might ""feel"" like you can't take a break without lighting up but it isn't reality. It's not even legal in the US. If others get a smoke break, you get a break break. Talk to HR if its an issue with management. 

There was a guy on here years ago that brought one of those little jars of bubble solution outside for his smoke breaks. Just blew bubbles for 3 minutes while other employees smoked.  At least it's something to do.  Grab a book. Download a podcast. 

Break the pattern!  In my mind ecigs are crap and not tested for long term health results.  Plus they just keep the behavior loop going. "I started smoking at 15 during my freshman year in high.  I smoked for 20 years and tried everything. Until Chantix came along...I had to quit drinking for a few months (it was a trigger) but that wasn't a big deal. It was one of the easiest things I've ever managed to do. I am now 4 years smoke free (except for the occasional stogie)."My girlfriend made a deal with me.  She won't have sex with me if she can smell smoke on my breath... I'll also tell her when I failed and had a smoke because I'm tragically honest.  Anyway, 16 months later it turns out I like sex WAY more than tobacco.""I quit smoking cold turkey on October 1. Every time I attempted to quit in the past I gained weight which would lead me back to smoking. This time, the day I quit I also started a fitness program. A friend of mine had amazing results doing the Insanity program so that's what I chose. I also started eating small meals every couple of hours and counting my calories. Small meals eliminates the unhealthy snacking habits I fell into during previous attempts AND gives me those little sanity breaks I used to get when I would step outside to smoke. Diet and exercise gave me something else to focus on, improved my mood, and, for the first time ever, I actually lost weight when I quit! I still think about it occasionally but I look and feel so much better than I have in years that it's easy to brush those thoughts aside. ""Went cold turkey after waking up New Years Day with a horrible sore throat from smoking maybe 30 to 40 in six hours (difficult to keep track when you're handing them out)

It's one of those things, like other people in this thread, I tried patches and gum etc but they just didn't work for me but they worked for others I know. I think one thing that needs to be mentioned however is that a few people will quit first time, others wont. This is probably the third time I've quit, you've just got to power through whatever triggered the relapse, and begin again.

EDIT: Spelling""Think about the money. Today it's $5.25 times 30 days, add in interest, think about retirement, think how much money of yours they have, think about paying for lunch, stay focused on the money. ""I tried giving up a number of times before I found a method that worked. The hardest part of giving up, IMO, is that when you stop smoking it actually changes a habit which is central to your lifestyle. As any smoker who drinks or works in the service industry knows, there are moments in the day in which a cigarette 'fits' and when you give up it's not just the nicotine you miss but the routine. In other words, you associate cigarettes with many other things in your life.

The problem with going cold turkey is that you are not just trying to stop smoking, you are simultaneously reordering important patterns in your life and breaking associations without compensating for it. The other problem with cold turkey is that it puts you 'on the wagon' so that when you fall off, the temptation is to go 'ah fuck it' and just start lighting up. If you set up huge numbers in your head (e.g. 35 days without a cigarette) it makes the failure that much more painful if (and most likely, when) it occurs.

So in order to avoid the damage to habit and the psychological stress of cold turkey I used a slow weaning process where I gradually changed both my habits around smoking while also slowly getting myself off them.
 
It had a number of phases:
1. I gradually reduced my smoking from 20 a day to about 3/4 a day. That was my first goal.  
2. Once I got there, I tried to cut down to smoking only at 'key' habit moments (such as a 5 minute break at work, or when drinking) but to forgo them at other times (and still not exceed 3/4 a day). This reduced my intake to about 10 a week.
3. Then I allowed myself a limited number of cigarettes at key moments and no cigarettes at other times. So, for instance, I would go out on a Saturday night and say ""I am allowed to have 3."" This had the effect of reassuring myself that I was allowed to smoke, but made me save it up, so to speak.
4. I cut that number down to 2 and then 1 cigarette. This meant I could still go out, still reassure myself that I was allowed to smoke and so avoid the stress. However, what naturally started to happen was I would ""save"" that cigarette until closing time.

One night, about nine years ago, I was sitting on the balcony of a bar that had its lights on while the staff were clearing everyone out and I was 'letting' myself have my cigarette and thought, ""I am not even enjoying this."" From then on I stopped smoking.

Now, bear in mind, I have probably smoked approx 30 cigs since then till now, but they have been at big parties or when hammered or whatever. The key thing is I broke the habit and CRITICALLY the associations that cigarettes had in my life.  Consequently, it would be very hard for me to start smoking again.

BTW, the whole process - from 20 a day to none - took about 7 or 8 months. 

TL;DR: One of the main problems of smoking is the associations you create between smoking and other things, and the danger off 'falling off the wagon.' I came up with an approach that broke the associations and never psychologically put me on a wagon to begin with.
""Cold turkey for me. I was fed up with spending tons of money (half pack a day easy), smelling like shit, having people not want to be around me when I smoke, and the most influential cause was the severe impact it had on my health. I had started gaining weight in college and wanted to lose weight and get fit and stop being sick. I quit smoking and started exercising and I've never been more fit in my life. Although I cheat once in a while and have a cigarette when I'm drinking with my buddies. But that's once a month at best. "I went cold turkey myself. But a friend of mine who had smoked for almost ten years told me that what finally got her to quit was a picture of healthy human lungs next to a set from a lifelong smoker from cadavers. The image scared her so much that she was able to taper off and quit. "Psychedelics, specifically LSD. I tripped twice about a week apart, and a few days after decided that I no longer wanted to smoke.  It really was that simple, as easy as choosing what clothes you want to wear in the morning or what to have for breakfast.   ""Once I was really ready, I used the patch.  It made me afraid to smoke because of all the warnings about it killing me if I did.  I basically built it up in my head that if I smoked within an hour of taking the patch off, bad things would happen.  I used the patch for a week and by the end of it, I knew I was done smoking.
Also, and I hate to sound cliche, but you really have to be ready mentally.  That's the biggest battle.  You have to have a distraction plan.  Most urges don't last long as long as you don't dwell on it.  If you feel like you want one, change your scenery, even if it's just a walk to the bathroom.  
You have to stay away from as many triggers as possible.  There's nothing that says you can't go out to the parking lot during work and walk a lap or 2.  If the smokers get the break, so do the non-smokers.  Bring a bottle of water and walk.  
It also helped that I found out I was pregnant 2 months after I quit.  I still get the occasional urge, even almost 4 years later...then I see how much they cost and the urge goes away.
Good luck!  You can do it!""I got engaged and made a promise to not smoke for a while. When you love someone, you'll do anything for them. Long story short, we're no longer together so I'm on and off smoking. "Tapering down. "I had been considering it for a long time. I failed about 12 or so times to quit. 

I had about two weeks off from work, finished off my pack and went for a walk to the store to buy smokes when I simply decided now was the time. 

It was probably the toughest three days in my immediate memory. Every time I felt a strong craving, I would go climbing at the gym until I was too exhausted to care. After a week, it got easier. After a month I was no longer thinking about it daily. 

After two months of being smoke free, I started running. That was the motivation I needed to carry on. 

Now I know if I start again, I have to give up the running, my climbing will decline and I would have to go through the three days of hell all over again. 

Also, I used the ""Since iQuit"" app. It's been 8 months and I've saved $2000 dollars (smokes are $13 a pack in Alberta). "Add up how much you spend a month on cigs. Worked for me"It's already been said that simply not smoking anymore is the way to go (cold). It's hard, and it will suck a little. You know the main reason people don't quit or revert?

3 years on the 15th of February and I smoked for 25."For me it was when I started to exercise heavily again. I hated running (and still do) but could feel my lungs being incredibly over worked. I eventually started to feel that every time I smoked I was in effect cancelling out the hard work I had gone through working out. By stopping. Jan 8th 2011 I had my last one and didn't have another one.I only smoke when I drink and I only drink on my days off"I had bronchitis so bad that I couldn't breathe well enough to smoke. Figured I'd have a smoke in a week or two when I could breathe again, and by that time I didn't want one anymore. I was too miserable from being sick to even notice withdrawal. ""The best way to stop is to never start. Seriously, fellow highschoolers and younger, please for the love of god don't start. Way to many of my buddies smoke tobacco and it is fucked.

And if you are desperate enough to start smoking cigarettes in the locker room, you have a serious problem."" This will probably sound ridiculous but the way I quit was by smoking cannabis every time I felt like a cigarette. Obviously you might find your self smoking cannabis a bit more and you might find it a little inappropriate at times but after 3 or 4 weeks and didn't feel the need for a cigarette anymore. 

Occasionally on nights out I will have a cigarette or 10 but the next day i feel kind of ashamed of my self for doing it."Not buying any. Seriously just dont walk into a store and buy them. Its that simple. "This book: books.google.com/books/about/The_Easy_Way_to_Stop_Smoking.html?id=cN_xAuodABgC

There's usually a pdf of it floating around on huge internet. I tried everything before that (nothing worked) but reading this book did the trick.  ""I quit cold turkey and used a couple methods to help me through the first couple weeks. 
It's good to occupy your mouth with something when having a craving, I used jolly ranchers. I could bite down on them and they lasted long enough to get me through the craving, plus helped redirect my oral fixation. After a couple weeks I switched to gum, since all that sugar isn't that great for you either. 
I also got a large clear vase and put it in a spot that I saw several times a day, the island in my kitchen. Every time I would have normally bought a pack if cigarettes, for me it was every other day, I put that cash in the vase, and used it as incentive to buy myself something I really wanted. 
I made a list of all the reasons I wanted to quit and taped it to my mirror. 
Also, no matter what the situation, DO NOT think you can have just one! It's not worth it, and it can easily send you back to regular smoking. 
Good luck! It's a tough thing to do, but it is so worth it! ""I had really good luck with Chantix one time I quit.  I went back to smoking well after the Chatnix was over, so I don't accuse it of failing.  Also, I didn't freak out and kill anyone either, which is a bonus.

That said, I decided at 37, after 25 years of smoking and on the precipice of my daughter's birth, I was done.  I had to be.  

I used patches for about 10 weeks.  It totally fucking sucked ass, but (sounds corny) I made a commitment that my daughter would never know me as a smoker.  I quit October 4, 2011, she was born about a month later, and I haven't had a cigarette since.  I thinks about smoking a lot, even still.  But every day gets easier.  I miss it, but I also miss being 12 and playing in the creek, or being 17 and going to prom or or being 29 and thinking that was sooooo old.  That ship has sailed; just fond memories now.  You can do it - really.  You have what you need already; just let yourself.

**TL;DR - you just have to be ready; really fucking mentally ready to be done.**""The first thing I did was quit smoking my favorite cigs.  The one right when I woke up, the on right after I ate, etc.  That was the hard part.  Then I gradually cut down, one cig every hour.  One cig every 2 hours.  After I was good with that, I stopped.  I had enough practice with fighting cravings that it was much easier at that point...they still smell good 2 years later though.  Hahaha.""Lobelia worked for me but only after years of tapering off my smoking habit. I stopped smoking in the house, then the car. I got down to 2 or 3 a day. Lobelia is chemically similar to nicotine but has a side effect that makes the smell of cigarettes repulsive.""Champix worked really well for me. No cravings even after I stopped taking it. It was nice. Cold turkey, minus the anxious sweats and shakes, I personally highly recommend it. 

Until one day, working a shutdown at a refinery, being two and a half months in with a total of 6 days off in total, and running on fumes, I made the mistake of walking through the smoke pit. The yearning of the smell never goes away, and I couldn't fight it.

Was the best 2 years in recent memory until that point. I'll probably do it again here soon. But I found it worked, and I loved the wild dreams. ""Both my wife and I stopped at the same time using CHAMPIX tablets from the doctor. It was a course of about 8 weeks, the first pack of 2 weeks worth built you up to full dosage then it gradually declined as you worked through hue he course.
The idea was to commit to taking the tablets, nothing more. We both had a real desire to quit, but the doctor told us ""just take the tablets and don't worry about setting a quitting date.""
It was about 5 days in to the course that I stopped smoking, my wife was the following day. It's not like there was a sort of epiphany or light bulb moment, I just found myself not smoking and not even thinking about smoking!
That was a little over 3 years  ago and I honestly can't think of the last day I thought about lighting up. It just never crosses my mind. 
Oh, I smoked at least 20 a day for about 20 years, although I was on very mild cigs by the end.
CHAMPIX were great, though I do remember feeling slightly nauseous but that may have been withdrawal symptoms. The best decision I have ever made was committing to taking those tablets.
As for my wife, she also stopped although she sometimes says she misses smoking. I think it's the idea of taking a quick break for a smoke; it's the breaks she misses, not the smoke. I get that, smoking is often a group event!""Smoked for 10 years or so, I quit over the course of a month or two

First by cutting smoking out of my car completely, I'd usually have two on my way to and from work, as well as lighting one up every time I got in the car. I also started buying 20 packs as opposed to 25s

Then I gave myself a budget of only about $20 a week for smokes. I was a pack a day smoker so this wasn't easy and basically allowed me 4 shitty packs, or two packs of a brand I enjoyed (Belmont Milds)

It wasn't too bad going this route, but the hardest was not smoking when out drinking, so I simply stopped getting drunk every weekend for a couple months."Getting addicted to videogames made me quit.I smoked until the day I heard my name and cancer in the same sentence. Cancer cured my smoking."Not sure if it will work for everyone because I only smoked for 5 years.  My method:  Used the patch for the nicotine and carried toothpicks with me for the physical addiction of holding something in my hands and holding in my mouth.  Can use the same motions with a toothpick.  This help around my friends that smoked.  After I kicked the nicotine addiction, toothpicks were easy to put down.""I quit cold turkey after 13 years. I had finally had enough and I read Alan Carr's book and it helped me change my outlook. That mixed with the support of the fine folks over at /r/stopsmoking, I'm almost 200 days smoke free now. My big realization was that I had brainwashed myself into thinking smoking gave me something that it actually did not. I gave it credit for things which were really just part of life, smoker or otherwise. I tricked myself into thinking it was hard to stop and that life wouldn't be the same after quitting."chantix helped for me. but I am still addicted to nicotine and chew the gum and lozenges regularly. it's expensive but at least I am not smoking. "strong will + the nicorette spray, which I have now transitioned to the gum (which I still chew)"Pretty much all my friends smoke. I quit a year and a half ago or so cold turkey. For me it was actually finding a girl who wants me to be around long enough and be healthy. "Was in Thailand and saw one of those gross out pictures on the pack. Thought about it and realized I smoked to be a rebel but I was finding that I was becoming dependent on it. I made the decision to quit 12 days ago, I just hope I have the strength never to light up ever again.""I quit a year ago using a quality e-cig and I have no desire to smoke cigarettes again.  I've also lowered the nicotine twice and my next step is to go nicotine free by the summer.  
I love vaping the juice and I'll keep using it for a while. ""Just don't smoke.

Now, I will admit that I still have the odd ciggy when I've been out for a meal and drink, but I can just have the one ever couple of months and enjoy it and that's it.

I could never really understand the attraction of smoking though.  I smoked regularly for years but only a few a day and with the gradual price rise the gaps between them just got bigger and bigger until I was getting a pack at the weekend and then eventually just stealing other peoples' on a night out."Vaping"Honestly, I got so pissed off at myself that I had failed to quit so many times that I threw them all out the window and refused to buy more. I guess attempting to punish myself (kinda weird I know). But my big triggers were drinking and long drives. Quit drinking and that helped a lot but my long drives were pretty difficult. Some days it still hits me pretty hard. ""To be honest, I just quit cold turkey. The first couple of weeks were hard: shaking, cold sweats, anxiety attacks. But, once you suffer through it, it's as easy as telling yourself that the craving for a cigarette passes in about three minutes. Just man the eff up and do it. "Cold turkey with a friend. We each put in $10 into a bucket every day.

It's always in the car/truck, on the way to work in the morning.

I started Chantix in January 2013.  After about 2 weeks I had zero physical cravings.  After I stopped taking it, I would still have mental cravings when I was driving, or when I saw friends smoke.  But, I have not gone back since. 

I don't know if I was just lucky, but I had a great experience with Chantix-- maybe one or two vivid dreams (not nightmares)..and that is it.  No suicidal thoughts or depression, yada yada yada.... 

I am not some secret online marketer promoter for Chantix, I promise--but it worked REALLY well for me and I would highly recommend it.

Its like 300 bucks, and at least last year, my insurance didn't cover it.  But in the long run its really worth it.  My bro is on it now so we will see how it works for him. ""It started to affect my quality of life so I quit cold turkey.  It was impeding my ability to do the things I wanted to do.  Whenever I begin to consider smoking again, I remind myself why I quit.  The reasons are substantial.  I wouldn't have been able to quit otherwise.""The short answer is cold turkey, but it's a bit more complicated than that.  

I've been trying to quit for a couple years.  I started with e cigarettes but at the end, I felt like I was using it as an excuse to ""smoke"" indoors and I still was reaching for the real thing outside - although I was smoking less.  The patches worked for a while for me.  I went a good month on patches not touching a cigarette.  But in the end, I gave back in.  

For me to finally stop, it took a wholesale change in my behavior.  When I got a new job, moved to a new town and got a new place, I took that opportunity to reestablish my habits.  I decided that this town wasn't going to be one where I smoked.  The little ticks like reaching for one as soon as I step outside, I actively tried to replace (taking a really exaggeratedly deep inhale).  I made sure there wasn't one in my vicinity so that even when I wanted one, it'd be a pain in the ass for me to get.  I'm going 4 months strong and I think I'm gonna make it.""Ecigs. But not those shitty ones you get in the mall or gas station. They suck, and they're owned by Phillip Morris and other big tobacco companies anyway. And don't believe the BS about not knowing about safety. While it's true there hasn't been inhalation studies on all the fda approved flavorings, there isn't actually much in there. It's mostly propylene glycol, which there have been TONS of studies on the inhalation effects, all of which say the worst is a little irritation after copious amounts. Source: I'm a chemist and had access to literature databases. The fda was basically straight up lying in the early days. Now they just focus on the flavorings. But if you're really all that concerned just get unflavored. Propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine actually taste pretty good on their own. 

Ecigs allow you to have nicotine (which on its own is no more dangerous than caffeine) and to wean yourself down to no nicotine. It also allows you to have the oral fixation effect, which was always my biggest problem with quitting. Car rides were boring, sitting at my desk too long made me antsy. Now a puff or two of my ecig takes care of that. 

After a good deal of experimentation and lots of money spent, I believe I have an ideal setup for the average user. Look for the following online, there's always deals to be had everywhere:

**Battery:** eGo-C twist. The short one is closer to cigarrillo size, but less battery. The larger one is cigar sized, maybe slightly smaller. Some smokers are initially put off by the size and want a smaller one. Just trust me on this one. The size won't bother you at all after a day of use. 

**Atomizer/tank:** this is what holds and vaporizes the juice.  My preference is for the Kanger Evod. Although if you don't mind something a little bigger with much better features, such as the air intake not being next to the battery connection, which sometimes resulted in leaks causing connection issues, check out the Kanger Aerotank. 

**Juice**: now this is a tough one, because it's all personal preference. The ecig community has always raved about Backwoods Brews ejuice. And for good reason, it's awesome. Now you're never going to find something that tastes exactly like a cigarette. Just accept that. Because there are tons of awesome flavors. I suggest the Applewood tobacco. Anything mint and mocha is always good too. And if you were a menthol smoker, you're in luck, because menthol cigarettes just taste like menthol anyway, and there are tons of menthol based flavors out there. So just try a bunch of small sample sizes before you settle on your all-day vape. When in doubt with a juice vendor, try their RY4. It is a unique chocolate tobacco flavor that pretty much every vendor has their own version of and it's almost always good. For something lighter, search for RY3.

Hope that helps. Feel free to PM me with any questions. I know wayy too much about this stuff at this point. "I'm only 18 and i started smoking occasionally just because I had could finally purchase cigarettes myself. I told myself I wouldn't get addicted but found myself smoking every day. I told myself I needed to quit and after talking to some guys at work who smoke packs a day it really helped me realize how bad the addiction could become. I just stopped purchasing cigarettes altogether and haven't smoked in a long time now."Allen Carr
""Cold turkey.... Slowed down like the last year I was smoking then the gf told me it was her or the cigs, and I said her not only because she did this but because I was only killing myself. Honestly I haven't gone the full 2years with out a drag off a cigarette but I've been 2 years without buying them and I haven't smoke a full cigarette since. Also I've gone 6 months plus without so much as a drag off a cigarette.... I just slip up when I'm drunk and take a couple drags off a buddy's. But let me tell you the wanting of a cigarette never goes away. And that's not just my word I've known other that say the craving never goes away... It subsides sometimes but if you get stressed the first thing that always comes to mind is. GIVE ME THAT CIGARETTE. Also I was a smoker for about 8 years which isnt even that bad. I'm just glad I changed for the better. Honestly it wasn't that hard either just realize you are only killing yourself and paying for it.... That just seems dumb.""I'm sure this will get buried. I have now quit for almost one year after smoking for about 15 years. I have tried quitting a couple other times with varying success. The only thing that has ever worked is cold turkey. 

What has worked for me this time. I changed some of my routines to avoids triggers. You will still get triggered but it helps some. I also got an app on my phone that keeps track of the amount of time I have quit, how many cigarettes I haven't smoked, and most importantly how much money I have saved. Most importantly just will power. I decided I wanted to not smoke more than I wanted to smoke. You have to quit because you want to, not because you think you should. If your heart isn't in it, it isn't going to work. ""Tapered those nicotine lozenges.  I also wanted to quit, so when my taper was at crumbs I was done.  You still get that smidge of a craving, but i is A LOT less than what it would have been when I was at a full lozenge.

I think I'd still be smoking if I did cold turkey because I have a personality where I get hooked on things easily.""I was suddenly and overwhelmingly terrified of dying from a smoking related illness. I stopped immediately. Mentally it was so easy but I knew it was going to be difficult physically. To help myself I bought a load of apples and rice cakes. For the first week or so, whenever I felt like I wanted a cigarette I ate an apple or rice cake. The craving went away totally after about 3 weeks. I have not smoked for about 11 years but I have the odd dream where I have started again, even though I absolutely do not want or need a cigarette. I guess they are just dreams about life the same as any other. I don't consider myself a smoker who doesn't smoke, I consider myself a non-smoker and try to forget that I ever did.""I started smoking ""socially"". I wouldn't really go buy a pack and smoke on my own, but anytime I'd be out drinking or out with friends who smoked, I'd have one or two. That eventually turned into a pack a day habit that lasted for a few years. 


I tried quitting a bunch of times throughout those few years. I tried cold turkey a few times and nicotine patches a few times. The longest I made it any of those times was maybe a month (and I hated everything by the end of that month). 


I've been a non smoker again since August 8th, 2013. And ultimately, it was going cold turkey. BUT. I had help this time. It sounds crazy, but I read a book by Alan Carr called ""Easy Way to Quit Smoking"". The title makes it sound like a gimmick, but I came home one day and decided enough was enough, so I read through the book in one sitting. After i finished that book, it was still challenging at times, but I felt like i had a different mindset about it and like I was better equipped to deal with the cravings that soon disappeared."Vape pen.Gum for two years during the week and only smoking on the weekends. Then I decided that was stupid. So I quit. Though I did wait until a week where my girlfriend was on a business trip and my boss was on vacation. "I didn't read any of the other comments, but: E-Cig. /r/electronic_cigarette is a great community."Not drinking. "My cat died suddenly of lung cancer, and helping him through the last few weeks of his life was emotionally devastating. Shortly after that I got really sick with a chest cold and decided it was time to quit for good. Been smoke free for 9 months now!

*please note - I never, ever smoked indoors around my pets so my kitty getting lung cancer wasn't caused by that. "Pretty sure I had a minor heart attack during my morning smoke years ago. Haven't touched a cig since.Smoking a lot of pot help me quit"Smoked for 6 years before I came to the realization that I really didn't even enjoy them anymore. I didn't pick a date I just said ""This is my last pack. I've got to improve my run time and I'm only smoking because I'm so used to it by this point."" I caved a couple times. Bought a pack while drinking. Bummed a cigarette here or there on stressful days at work, but cold turkey worked for me. You have to remember why you're quitting but don't constantly think about it and before you know it two weeks has gone by and the urge has died down. I wanted to smoke while drinking or after a good meal but recognize and resist those triggered urges and eventually you'll get past it. ""Quit cold turkey, mostly because the prices for a pack were slowly raised to retarded levels where I used to live.""I used the patch for the first few days (to help get over the worst part of it), and then went cold turkey.

I chewed sunflower seeds every time I got in my car and always kept Lifesaver mints in my purse to suck on when I got the urge to smoke.""I smoked for 20 years or so. I got the opportunity to move countries and decided after I get on the plane, I will never buy another box. I put my last cigarette out before boarding and never lit up again. I do not even know what smokes cost here. After many attempts, it took getting completely out of my routine and starting something new to stay the course. I quit 6 years ago."A loved one getting angina is a pretty big one.....but i wouldn't recommend having any of your loved ones getting that just to entice you to quit. :p"One day I realized the ridiculousness of the habit... Why am I paying so much money to slowly poison myself to death? I don't need this to survive so why am I paying for it? After 15 years I quit smoking cold turkey and never had a craving and never looked back.

I guess being a cheap bastard worked out for me that time.""My daughter cried and told me she didn't want me to die. It made me give up straight away. I got on the patches, they worked great, never looked back. ""Seeing a long time smoker cough up blood, then light up. "I just stopped.After I got out of the military I had to move in with my dad for a bit. He told me if he ever caught me smoking he would kill me. He showed me the gun. Cold turkey it was and I'll be damned if it didn't work! Thanks dad! "Not quitting quitting. As far as the cold turkey/NRT debate, I used nicotine gum and chewed it for at least a year after my last cigarette. I went from 2.5 packs (or the equivalent with rollies) to the full strength gum to the light gum at the point I was meant to quit gum. For a year or two after the gum, I'd occasionally get a nic fit, but I had distanced myself from cigarettes so much, I'd crave the gum.  

I am now almost six years after my last cigarette, and I never get nic fits. I hate smoke. I don't mind it if people smoke outside, away from my window, but I hate the smell. Yes, I am one of those ex-smokers and I am so fucking glad I am. My father-in-law, a smoker for longer but a much lighter smoker (<a pack a day) quit a month or two before me and still craves a cigarette almost every day. Not saying either experience is typical with either method as it probably depends on the smoker, but this is my experience.

As far as quitting, once you get there, it's the most amazing feeling. It still amazes me that I am a non-smoker. From my first few packs, I was always a heavier smoker than those around me. By the time I was 18, I was smoking more than a pack and a half a day. It took me a few years of different methods and attempts to quit, but I know the biggest factor was just being determined to get to the point where I didn't smoke. Not to the point where I just smoked at parties or at the pub, but no smoking at all. ""I smoked for 9 years. Decided to quit. Not because of health or money reasons. In fact i enjoyed smoking a lot. The reason I stopped was non smoking friends telling me how much it stunk. 

I believe anyone can stop smoking if they want. Just remember the whole battle takes place in the mind. I thought to myself on the very first day I quit "" The only way I will put another cigarette in my mouth is if somebody has a gun to my head "" .  Every time I had a bad craving I just though that. And after a week it was much easier. Its been 9 months now and the urge to smoke hasn't gone all together but when I get an urge I just remind myself that I'm in control. I've beat it and no matter what it will stay beat.
""Getting knocked up. Haha.
No really, I started with the electronic cigarettes to help get me through cravings. Then I tried nicotine gum but I found that I couldn't chew an entire piece as it would make me jittery and burn my mouth so I started chewing half pieces. 
For the first month or so, I avoided drinking (a craving trigger of mine even still) and avoided hanging out with or around smokers. This meant eating in the break room at work instead of going outside where all the smokers congregate. 
Also, I saved this picture http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z-qFD3X-xbE/UjTSJsocwaI/AAAAAAAAJfs/egSOt3prFuY/s1600/q.jpg to my phone and looked at it whenever I had a bad craving.
6 months later, I am still smoke free.""Few (4-5) of my friends stopped smoking after reading one book (about 100pages long)

If anyone is interested I'll ask them for title.""Electronic cigarettes.

I did everything else.  Cold turkey, patches, gum, so on.  Everything except for the pills (which I refused to touch after seeing what they did to my dad).

I saw Blu, several years ago, and started doing research.  The 510 had just came out, so I bit the bullet and bought a kit.  When it came in on a Saturday, I had bought a pack the night before.

It was the last pack of cigarettes I've purchased.

Edit: I just remembered there was a point that I bought a pack.  I had stopped using my 510/mods at that point, and my dad's 'easy, 2 day recovery' surgery turned into 'fuck, he almost died', which then had almost a year of insanity related to that surgery .  I had no working batteries, no working chargers, etc., and bought a pack.  Then went back to vaping as soon as I could get a replacement to my door.  So when I bought my 510, the night before was the *second* to last pack.""Willpower (should that be 2 words?).  Really, nothing worked until I just decided I wasn't going to smoke anymore.  That was 10 years ago and I smoked for 20.  After the first week you've basically kicked the physical addiction which doesn't mean it's easy but you no longer need the cigs you just want them.""I moved to USA, where cigs cost U$12 while at my hometown they used to cost the equivalent to U$2""You really have to want to quit otherwise it will never happen.  Once you have made that decision it depends on your will power.  I am weak in that department so I tried eCigs this time around.  It really helps for the action of smoking that is the hard habit for me.  The nicotine withdrawal is manageable but the hand to mouth habit is really tough.

I started with a higher dose of nicotine in my ecig and each time i order more juice, i drop it down a level.   So far so good, 6 months in!"I never drank coffee before so I traded cigarettes with coffee. I've been smoke free for a year and four months. Cold turkey after spending some time on whyquit.org.  It's been 3 years after smoking for about 24I hear going to a sauna to sweat out the nicotine helps. You need to go there like two days in a row or something.Quit cold turkey when I found out I was pregnant. My girlfriend dumped me. She hated that I smoked so to spite her I quit cold turkey. Its been over six years since I had a cigarette. "For me it was persistent bronchitis. I got so sick of feeling like hammered shit, I just threw my last pack away and that was that.

I've had a couple of isolated ones since but never started again.""I started by only smoking 3 times a day, the important smokes was after meals, and taking a shit smokes (smokers know wassup). And I stayed high off of some good weed most of the day, when I was high and cotton mouth cigarette smoke taste was nasty to me. 3 cigs a day and when I could I smoked weed to get me off cigs. Eventually cut those 3 a day to 2, then 1....then before I knew it.""Cold turkey and sunflower seeds (in shell).  I'm not going to blow smoke up your ass--I was a miserable bastard, and I'm sure I made a few people around me miserable as well.  After a month, though, I was pretty well good to go.""i think the thing for me was realizing and being okay with the fact that i am never going to have another cigarette again. once you accept that, just adhere to it. just stop, that's it. "Sounds dumb but Allen Carrs Easy Way to quit smoking. Never read the book but a friend sent me a bootleg of the web seminar. Sat through all 4 hours and never looked back. Went from white knuckle discipline quitting to just being totally over it after 15 years of heavy smoking. Can't recommend highly enough. Seen it work for some serious lost causes. "Cold turkey is the only way. Don't bother yourself with excuses. Remove yourself from the environment for 2 weeks, and you'll be in the clear. Good luck.""for me, it was realizing that those stressed feelings - moments of panic - cravings for a cigarette etc - cigarettes don't help those feelings, they CAUSE them.  and it means that when you're in the worst part of a craving,  the best way out is through.

make that your mantra -  The best way out is always through.

also - no substitutes.  gum, nicotine patches, e-cigarettes.  none of it.  cold turkey.""I smoked for 12 years, and when I quit it was just cold-turkey. I know that many people can't do this, but it worked for me.

Almost 10 years free of it now."Actually wanting to quit coupled with Chantix."I smoked a pack a day for about ten years, and was working my way up to about a pack and a half a day. I'd tried the gum twice, the patch twice, and Welbutrin once without success. I finally broke down and got an e-cig and just stuck with that for six months, hitting it as frequently as I'd light a cigarette, without cheating and having any real cigarettes. After those six months I quit that thing cold turkey.

     I also took up the sport of fencing to reward myself and reenforce my decision to stop smoking.""I went to a local MMA gym in town looking to do something with my life and not be a piece of shit anymore. The gym I went to took people with any level of experience and they preached ""You can do it, but you have to put the time in."" I really dedicated myself to it. The workouts were so intense and I absolutely hated, but I started gaining confidence everyday as well as learning self respect. I took it very seriously and I realized smoking was severely inhibiting my ability to perform my new hobby. I quit cold turkey 4 years ago because I dedicated myself to a new lifestyle and never looked back. Cheers."Just not smoking anymore seems to do the trickI substituted it with snus. Worked for me :)[This](http://youtu.be/0TL2Vh7goJc) video helped me tremendously."I met my now girlfriend that basically took me away from my friends and away from the neighborhood that would encourage smoking. 
You see, I would go to my friend's house and jam out and smoke all weekend. We knew a lot of people around the neighborhood so they would come by and smoke in the garage. 

Since when my girlfriend and I made it official, I ultimately stopped going over and that's when I quit meth cold turkey. ""I also quit cold turkey (mostly). I had some old nicotine gum lying around that I chomped on a few times but that's it. I didn't change any routines really...I still drink coffee and alcohol which are two things that really draw me to smoking. I just forced myself to get used to drinking without smoking. Having regular old minty gum around also helped me. 

The impetus to quit came from a couple things. First and foremost was the cost. At about $7.50 a pack, it's just too much money to throw away. I really like smoking, but the obvious negative health benefits also forced me to quit. I got tired of clearing my lungs left and right, and after having sinus surgery and a tonsillectomy, I can finally truly enjoy the benefits of normal breathing. 

I used this kind of chart to track my ""progress"": http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html

Knowing that my body is fixing itself after years of smoking kept me motivated. The other thing I really liked is that at the end of the day, I still smell like I took a shower, rather than an ash tray.
""Chantix helped with the actual quitting. Made me smoke less and less, and not even want them. In fact, by the time I quit, they were disgusting to me. This was just in 1 week. Then for the next couple months while I still took it I wanted none. Once you're done with it, just like any quit smoker, you still have that want occasionally. Maybe while driving, or partying, or watching a movie where someone lights up even, so staying quit is all on you and WANTING to stay quit. Hands down, Chantix was the best at breaking the chemical side of the addiction, but for the psychological side it's all on you no matter what way you quit. Obviously, this is only great if you're not one of the ones that it makes hallucinate, go crazy, and try to kill yourself. Thankfully I had zero side effects.""e-cig worked for me and I was smoking 1 to 1/12 packs a day for about 10 years. what kind of e-cig you have can make a world of difference, as well as the juice. Right now I'm vaping out of a Vamo V5 with a Kanger Pro-tank 3 and some honey pearry juice from the vapor chef. I got the equipment for about 90 bucks but it's the best vaping setup I've had so far. I ""quite"" smoking in the beginning of last August, with the occasional cig. the last time I had one, about a month ago it made me sick and tasted awful. So IMO do a bit more research in vaping. When I started I was at 18mg of nicotine and now I'm down to 12mg with a spare tank that has 6mg. Been trying to use the 6mg more so I can continue to decrease to 0mg. ""My girlfriend help me quit 3 years ago. I slip every here and then when i'm drinking, but when i wake up theres no urge to smoke. In the beginning i knew my temptation was intense when i drank so i quit that for a while too. Its just your attitute towards quitting that works. Quiting cold turkey is the way I did it. Eating lots of gum and sunflower seeds helps too.""""Madness is repeating the same thing over expecting different results."" Keep trying to quit, you have obviously failed a few times (no worries, we all have). If your sane (which I am assuming you are) you will eventually stop. Otherwise, well, at least you are in the right profession. ""I smoked a lot of weed with my cigarettes and when I switched to vaping, I smoked less often. After one really hungover day where I couldn't even get out of bed for a stoge, I decided the next day that if I could go one day without a smoke, I could go two days, and so on. I also found myself getting stoned more often after quitting, but it leveled off in the end"Determination. And just realizing how much my 20+ years of smoking have fucked up my health. I celebrated 3 years last week.I got my wisdom teeth pulled out. 3 weeks later I realized I hadn't smoked and just stick with it. It's been 4 years and I don't crave it unless I've been drinking. I do admit that I've smoked one on occasion but never started up again. "I quit while I had a bad cold, which made the first three days go by easily. I never could smoke while I had a cold. Then, I quit drinking coffee and beer for two weeks, and going out to bars for the next month or so. I started drinking tea and taking tea breaks instead of smoke breaks. I smoked for 15 years, and I've been off of them for over four years now. Good luck!""I was really sick in the hospital for two weeks and they didn't allow smoking in the room, was really expensive but it worked. (Would not recommend this method) Still had cravings for two years whenever I smelled the refreshing aroma of tobacco.""Pot.
Smoked pot a lot
Worked"I smoked while wearing the patch. Getting nauseous/sick when I smoked did the trick. "I quit when a pretty girl said she'd make out with me if I went 2 weeks without a cigarette. I'm at 7 years, 2 months, 17 days... and still waiting for her to make out with me."Cold turkey by far and actually really wanting to quit. Start Vaping. Ecigs are great and satisfy your oral fixation. You can still step out with your co-workers and even vape at your desk for the most part depending on your workplace. Everyone in my department quit smoking in the last 6 months thanks to vaping. I rarely even pull out my ecig anymore unless i'm ultra stressed. "Love, actually. "Recognising all the triggers that made me want to smoke and either avoiding them or having strategies to deal with them. It took me a dozen tries but I'm at 6 months now and I've got no compulsion to start again."Fear.

I smoked for 6 months and would wake up hacking up black shit from my throat (newports) just quit it right then.

Wake up every morning to black phelm wasn't my idea of a good habit.""I quit cold Turkey.  I had a mantra when I was feeling weak and craving a smoke, which was ""stop being a pussy"".  It was my way of mind over matter.  Feel like a cigarette after a meal?  Stop being a pussy!  Stressed at work and need a smoke?  Stop being a pussy!  I don't know, it worked for me.

I am 7 years without a cigarette."I quit smoking via coma. (Not recommended)just smoked a joint instead"I used to smoke a pack a day. I quit using e-cigarrettes.

The trick with e-cigs is the following:

1. Get the e-liquid with the highest nicotine content (24+ mg)

2. **Don't quit smoking,** instead, 2-3 minutes before smoking, use the e-cig, that way when you do smoke, your body will already have nicotine, and the real cigarrette will not be as good.

3. After a few days of doing this 2 things will happen: YOu will stop associating Nicotine with Cigarettes, and the cigarrettes will start to taste bad, even to the point of making you nauseous. 

4. **Dont try to force quitting cigarrettes**, since after a while it will not be pleasant to smoke as long as you hit the e-cig beforehand.

5. Once you have a month or 2 without smoking cigarrettes, start changing the e-liquid every month to another with lower nicotine content. In my case i went 24,18,12,0. 

The whole process took me about 4 months, but the great thing is that **it was not hard**. I didn't have the abstinence issues because it was gradual and I never had to deal with being all anxious for a cigarette.

""For me Wellbutrin really took the edge off the craving while I tapered down.  I tapered pretty quickly (4 weeks?) and only took the drugs for another 4-6 weeks after that.

This was after several stints of patches (didn't work) and cold turkey (too hard).  Been 8 years now."I dropped extacy one night and me and 2 others killed a carton of Newports in a 8 hr period.  They next day I felt like complete shit and have not touched a cig since.  "I started with the patch then switched to the gum and lozenges.  Haven't had a cigarette in 3 years.  (Of course, now I need to try to quit the gum and lozenges because I'm still hooked on the nicotine.  But at least I can breathe and I don't smell like smoke.)""I used ""e-cigs"". I started with a cheap gas station model and quickly moved up to a high end Mod and RBA Dripper. 

Over the course of three months I slowly dropped my nicotine levels down to zero and I have been at Zero nicotine for 2 months now.

I now continue to vape because it became a hobby and something to keep myself busy when I get frustrated. Being a recovering alcoholic as well this has been a life saver for me more than just when it comes to tobacco.""Willpower... Tons and tons of willpower!

It was my father dying that gave me the push so, as has been stated, with the right reasons its easy.""Out of curiosity, which type of electronic cigarette are you using? I live in a family of smokers, and my brother had tried using vaporizers that look similar to actual cigarettes (like those you would find at a convenience store). He said it was ""alright"" but didn't give him that feeling in his throat that a normal cigarette did.

So I did a bit of research and got him a Kanger EVOD starter kit from a local vape shop. He loves it, and hasn't even thought about smoking a tobacco cigarette in almost a year.

I'd totally recommend heading over to /r/electronic_cigarette and checking out some of their resources. It's a wonderful way to start cutting back.""Ex-smoker - 3 packs a day for 20 years.   Quit 12 years ago.  I took a day to myself and spent it on a treadmill.   I'd wear myself out, rest awhile and when I wanted a cigarette I'd get back on the treadmill.   ALL  day  long. 
When I made it through that day without cigs it was such an accomplishment that I could not let myself pick another one up.  Another trick:  pretend you are smoking and go through the motions, sucking air in and blowing it out routinely through the day.  I think I was more of a ""habitual"" smoker than an ""addicted"" one....I loved the whole process of opening the pack, pulling one out, lighting up, etc.   The physical part of withdrawal wasn't horrible for me even at 3 packs a day.  Three packs means you have a lit one in your hand at all times.   Ugh!  One last thought - you HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT. ""I agree with quitting cold turkey. I replaced smoking with another vice,  video games. Video games with were such a great distraction from cigarettes and if my mood went foul from nicotine withdrawal, I could vent my frustrations at the screen and not hurt anyone. Heck, if you play LoL or COD people probably won't even notice. "[deleted]"I stopped smoking one day.  That's how i quit.  Take slow deep breaths if you get the urge, and remember that taking the easy way out, and caving in is foolish.    
Just take an e-cig with you if you think you can't control yourself. ""It's okay if the first time doesn't take. Each time you quit the odds increase that you will stay quit. It took about four times for me. Also, the anticipation of quitting is far worse than actually quitting.""For me, someone who tried quitting many times to varying degrees of success (but then again not, because I always ended up smoking again), what finally ended up working was a moderate dose of the patch and really just determination.

You need to want it, plain and simple. You need to realize how bad it is for you, and how stupid it is to throw so much money at a shitty unhealthy version of yourself. 

I decided I really wanted it, used Step-1 of the patch for 2 weeks before I started to forget to put it on, at which point I decided I didn't need it anymore and just went on cold turkey.

I used the patch occasionally after that when drinking with friends, but now I just buy Colts, or Captain blacks (cigarellos with plastic filters). I find the plastic filter is important because smoking them that way is really nothing like smoking a cig.

It will be a year for me March 1."Zyban worked for me. It made cigarettes not enjoyable."I switched to e-cigs and it's been brilliant. My problem was always that in addition to being hooked on nicotine I really enjoyed the flavour and smell of tobacco. Patches etc were great for the cravings but it's hard to give up something that you genuinely enjoy. 

So I switched over to one of these: http://www.vipelectroniccigarette.co.uk/photon-express-kit-p-235.html

And it's honestly great because in addition to the nicotine it's got a lovely flavour and you have a great deal of control over how strong it is. Not to mention that buying the refil liquid is easily less than buying cigarettes!""25 M here. Smoked a pack a day for 7 years. Then quit cold turkey. Allen Carr, ""the easy way to stop smoking"" 

Worked for me and I believe if i can stop smoking ....."Currently on 2months of no smoking. So far push-ups have helped. I get a craving I do push-ups until I hate myself. Worked so far. "I had quit and restarted many times in my 20+ years of pack-a-day smoking. This last time had a major difference. I didn't like who I was anymore. I wanted to change and be the person I always imagined I should be; healthy, financially sound, a good father and emotionally optimistic. 

I already had a running list of those personal traits that I didn't like about myself. So I did the math and picked the one thing that would shift my course the most. Smoking won hands down. I had quit before but always came back so i looked at the mechanism of failure in the past. And it was right in front of me. I was ""quitting"" smoking. It is understood that the physical addiction to nicotine is not nearly as powerful as the habitual nature of smoking.

So I decided that I wouldn't quit smoking this time but instead would become a non-smoker. I would have to adopt new habits rather than just rely on abandoning existing ones. Quitting smoking is not about secession of an activity. It's about learning how to spend your time doing other things. Initially, the new thing that I was going to do was not smoke. I had to focus on ignoring a short term desire and keep my eyes toward my long term goal. Every time I jonesed, I would take a deep breath and tell myself that I never want to be a slave again. I want to breath deeply and for as many years as I could manage. I was desperate to succeed in this one way. 

And it worked. Quitting smoking is miserable. I didn't drink because I was terrified of failing. I avoided being around smokers for the same reason. I also said I would do whatever it took to not smoke. For me, eating was how I managed the cravings. I stuffed myself with comfort food until the endorphins kicked in. 30lbs later I was mostly over the insanely overwhelming desire to smoke. When the little joneses popped up, I would take a deep breath and realize I couldn't feel my lungs anymore. With the realization that I could breathe and smell again, I took up some exercise. Suddenly I wasn't a smoker who wanted to quit. I was a non smoker who wanted to be fit. 

Becoming a nonsmoker has been the single greatest gift I have ever given myself. I hope you will give yourself the same freedom. Remember, you are a slave. ""I smoked for years and tried to quit I don't know how many times. The problem was I ENJOYED smoking. When I was finally successful it was after a night of partying. I felt like shit and decided that was it. I wasn't going to smoke or drink anymore. I was very serious and determined. I wanted to quit. And that first day of sobriety and no smoking .... guess where my husband wanted to go? (He still did both-but I did eventually nag him into quitting smoking 6 months later) My husband and I went to the casino (where people are allowed to smoke indoors.... and everywhere you look that's what people are doing.) I swear he was testing me. But I still did not give up, and every time I wanted a smoke, I thought to my self: ""I've come this far, I can get through this, I don't want to start at zero again!""

My triggers were drinking and work breaks, coffee in the morning, etc, etc.

 I quit drinking at the same time, because once you have had a couple drinks, there goes your willpower and you'll start smoking again. It's much easier to say yes to a cig after a few drinks. 

At work (I was a waitress at the time (so pretty much the same thing as you- no breaks for people unless they are taking a smoke). And for me, that wasn't the bad part. Keeping  busy is actually a good thing. When I did take my lunch break, I started doing crossword puzzles to keep myself occupied and not thinking about smoking.

Eventually I started drinking again (a few years later) but by then, I only drank occasionally and much less than before. In the almost 9 years that I've been smoke free, I've only had about 4-5 cigarettes (and only one each slip up)- and each time drinking was involved. 

Beware of your SO or someone else trying to sabotage you (mine did a couple times before I finally quit- I think because HE didn't want to quit smoking.

Even today, almost 9 years later, I still think about cigarettes from time to time, and I even dream about buying a pack and smoking them. I guess it's like any other kind of addict, once you are addicted, you are addicted for life. But the good news is that you can quit and be successful at it.

I quit cold turkey and that worked for me. My will power isn't that great, so if I had one, I would have another and another. It was easier for me to just say No More. And stick to that. My husband, on the other hand, needed to gradually taper off until it was just once a day, then he stopped completely. It took him a couple months to completely quit. 

TL/DR: You have to really WANT to quit. It's about stopping bad habits and replacing with good ones. Be careful of others not supporting you/ making it easy for you to smoke again. 

Last of all, I would suggest not using the electronic cigs. That just keeps the habit going, not to mention the addiction to nicotine. It's like trading regular ice cream for no-sugar-added ice cream. It's still bad for you.""My brother had an aortic aneurysm, he (and I) have a heart defect known as a bi-cuspid valve. We both smoked at the time, he came extremely close to dying. As soon as I heard about it, my cravings disappeared... well for about 2 years, I now occasionally really want one.... Not much advice here I guess, but that is what worked for me. ""My husband and I tried the e cigarettes. I personally don't feel like they are much better for you than cigarettes, but I guess it helped me. I stopped using my e cig almost three months ago, and I haven't even thought about touching a cigarettes my husband on the other hand still secretly smokes cigarettes, and pretends to not know what I'm talking about when I asked if he smoked a cigarette today. Lol so I suppose it just depends on your will power. 
""Not myself, as I've never smoked, but my dad.

He smoked from 16 until 32 (I think), then on Father's Day my Mum bought him a packet of cigarettes and he realised how much his life had revolved around cigarettes for so long. 

He made sure not to disrespect my mother, but threw that packet, and whatever he had that related to smoking, straight in the bin, and never looked back.

Was one of the happiest days of my life seeing him quit. He was out walking the dog every day, playing football with me, throwing frisbees around with me and my friends, and he used the money he saved to buy his first decent camera. He is now an excellent photographer, and lives a happy life. GG Dad.""The first time I was able to quit for 6 months (the longest I've gone without tobacco) was through VAPING (electronic cigs). I started off with juices that had 15mg nicotine and I worked my way down eventually to 0mg nicotine over the course of a couple weeks. Probably the best way to quit, although juices can be expensive."A quitting buddy and complete abstinence from nicotine. Being able to talk to someone till the cravings go away really helped. P.S. they ALWAYS do go away! Even now after 5 years I still get cravings.  Its easier to blow them off now."Every time I wanted to smoke, right after I had the thought, I went to the kitchen and poured myself a glass of water. Not half a glass, not almost full, but full. Always.

Sometimes I just had a glass and on the way back to my room I had another thought about wanting to smoke, turned around and marched back to the kitchen for another full glass.

Quickly I grew tired of so much water and having to stand up to go to the kitchen. I was so full that my mind didn't want to think about smoking, because it hurt.

So I changed a bad habit for a good one.""Honestly there is no magic cure for quitting. I decided just to stop in March and I've been doing great. Of course you get urges to smoke and sometimes they are really strong but they eventually pass. And oh my god just after a month of no smoking you can breath so much better and you almost don't cough for no reason. Now I also understand why people hate the smell of cigarette smoke, the second my stepdad lights a cigarette I smell it and it makes my stomach upset. 

I would really like one of those E-Cigs though because I think the only reason I smoked is because it gave me something to do for a while. "Cold turkey and marijuana. Having a kid. Hands down the best reason to be a alive for as long as possible!!Will Power. Meditation. Mind over body attitude. "First off, I agree with a lot of the comments here that state something to the effect of ""more than anything, you gotta be ready to quit.""

That said, I don't agree with statements to the effect of ""in the end, only by willpower can you overcome your nicotine addiction."" As a person in recovery, I find that kind of thinking unproductive in any effort to achieve sobriety of any kind. Here's where that thinking leads (for me):

If one has willpower, one can quit.
I have been unable to quit.
I must not have willpower.
Since I don't have willpower, it's not worth it to even try quitting.

Anyone who relies or has relied on one addictive substance or another can tell you that thinking like that precedes a binge. The very definition of addiction is a behavior that cannot be curbed by willpower alone. Admitting to oneself that ""I can't do it without help"" is an essential element in most addicts' recovery plans.

My advice to OP is to get on a patch, gum or some other nicotine replacement therapy to remove the chemical craving and then develop strategies to treat the psychological craving. Patch didn't work for you before? Try again. It's your health on the line.

Or try a new strategy, like going to an AA meeting. Not an alcoholic? Go anyway. Find an open meeting in your area. No one there will make you speak. Just listen. Those meetings are filled with people talking about what to do when willpower is not enough. The lessons are transferable to any addictive behavior. Also visit www.smartrecovery.org for a more science/research-based approach to quitting/recovery.

Nicotine addiction doesn't make you drive dangerously or fight people or piss away the rent or perform sex acts for a fix, but that doesn't change one bit the fact that it's a serious substance-dependency issue. Treat it like one.




""Lung Cancer. Well, a scare of Cancer. 

I smoked for 17 years. Quit a few times on and off. The standard smokers mantra. 

Was having some chest pains for a few days. Went to see the Doc. Sent for xrays, found 'spots'. 

I panic. I'm a single parent with two kids. I quit that day. 

Get biopsy done. No cancer just damage from years of smoking and welding. 

I'm still not smoking, also not welding and now run Marathons.

It is not easy but it does get easier. You just need to remind your brain your in charge!

Best of luck.""When I was ready to quit smoking, I kept half a pack hidden away and used nicotine gum. Knowing that the cigarettes were there was comforting and a big motivational tool for me to just leave them alone. After I was smoke free for a month, I gave them away. ""i systematically cut down till i was at 3 or 4 cigs a day, then quit cold turkey. it was a miserable few days but i got over it. for awhile, i'd go outside and just spend ten minutes on reddit to fill the void. 

my husband waited till our 10 day vacation at disney world to quit because smoking there is difficult to do, mostly hidden out of sight so you forget about it, and there's plenty of distractions and junk to eat so you can be too busy to really dwell on it. after ten days, the physical symptoms were well over with and it's just a matter of mentally coping. ""Found other addictions?

Before quitting I had pretty bad strep throat for about a week. It hurt to do anything. I had to take pain meds and wait for them to kick in just so I could try to get some food down and sleep for a few hours before they wore off.

Smoking just hurt too bad and I was in too much pain to really notice the nicotine urges.

After I was able to eat/drink again, I figured that the hard part for quitting smoking was over (that initial week) so I said fuck it and stopped. 

Problem was, when I stopped my sinuses went fucking nuts. It looked like I got punched on either side of my nose there was so much swelling. They ended up putting me on Prednisone to get the swelling down. However, after that I had a really touch time breathing through my nose so, not knowing any better, I started using Afrin and it worked amazingly well.

A year later I finally gave that up and just deal with the withdrawal of it (SOOOOOO much worse than the nicotine). Due to not being able to breath right through my nose anymore, I started getting bad anxiety. So one day, in order to try to take my mind off of it, I grabbed a bag of sunflower seed and just started cracking and spitting them for hours at a time.

I ended up having surgery a few years later to try and correct the issues with my nose. It helped a little.

So now I have a crazy thing for sunflower seeds........

TL;DR - Get sick or find a new addiction""For my father it was a lung cancer scare. Nothing like a shadow in a x-ray to give you that extra boost of willpower. Luckily it turned out to be something benign, in more than one way."Marriage."I tried cold turkey and that obviously didn't work.. So I tried tapering off, and that failed as well. Then I tried the gum, which was so awful that I couldn't bring myself to chew it. The patch finally did it for me. I had some bizarre dreams while using the patch, but I had zero urge to smoke, and it was easy to remember to change it out and then not think about it for a while.""I'll tell you how my mom quit after smoking for 50 years.

She got a bad chest cold to the point where smoking hurt more than it was worth. The cold lasted 2 weeks and she was forced to not smoke for the duration. Coming out on the other side she had quit cold turkey and has been clean for years now.""Go sprint outside for as long as you can when you want to smoke. I mean, hard sprint so you are out of breath. Clears the craving. Don't use gum or patches. ""Twenty three years smoking here.
Two years ago I started walking/running and it was affecting me so I just took my last puff out of the last marlboro red I had and quit.
First week was a bitch, then smooth sailing from there on."Induced coma from side effects of swine flu.... I'm telling you best way to quit ever.!!!I just had enough and decided it was time."I know everyone is saying that cold turkey is the best way to go, but having quit using Chantix, I have to say it is extremely effective.  My mother quit with it first, and I was skeptical but she swore by it.  So I tried it a few months later.  They say to smoke for the first week while taking the drug.  I smoked for the first three days.  I didn't plan it that way but on the fourth day I just didn't want to smoke anymore.  I cant describe how well it worked.  The only real downside was the side effects.  Mostly crazy vivid dreams and mild nausea.  I would definately reccomend talking to a doctor about Chantix if you haven't been successful on your own.""Smoked for 15 or so years, been using electronic one for 2 years now.
Tried patches, gum and all kind of other nonsense before this, but none of them worked.

Guess I really lacked the will to quit, but I find using the e-cig a suitable substitute.
Sure, being able to quit completely would be optimal.""Have you tried a proper ecig or just a crappy cigalike?

Try this atomiser tank: www.ivapour-elixir.co.uk/mini-protank-2.html

With this battery: http://www.ivapour-elixir.co.uk/ego-v-v3-passthrough-1300mah-battery-black-stainless.html

Lots of videos on youtube about how to get the best out of this kit. Search for ""Protank"" and look for Pbusardo (basic maintenance and simple coil builds) and Rip Trippers (more complex coils).

You can buy replacement heads but if you're needing more vapour building your own can be better (takes about an hour to make enough for a year, once you know how to do it, and costs pennies per head).

That battery makes building really easy because it will test the resistance of the coil for you.

Best of luck. Get a decent ecig, seriously. I failed on the others so many times, this one cured me instantly.""Ecigs, not the gas station kind but the vaporizer kind. Made it so much easier and almost seamless"E-Cig did it for me.  Done day 1!!"I combined quitting with getting a cold. Dealing with withdrawal on its own is tough, but if you mix it with already feeling like crap, it's pretty tough to tell the difference! I three-days smoke-free before I even realized it.

So, I just I made a conscious decisions to not smoke -- this after smoking a pack a day for ~15 years. Seven days smoke-free and counting!""Switch to vapor or e-cigs. Find a good one that you enjoy the taste, has heavy smoke & hits the back of your throat and gradually mix it in. Vaping is fast becoming the most popular way to give up. You still get the nicotine, but non of the nasty carcinogens or smell, or tar, or ash...and you can reduce the amount until you're just vaping for fun. 

It's the only thing that helped me. ""Not really a good technique because it just happened but I got such a bad chest/sinus cold I could barely breathe. I attempted to smoke a cigarette because I wanted one sooo bad, it made me cough harder than anything in the world, my eyes were blood shot and I couldn't catch my breath. Freaked me out so bad I cold turkied it from that day on. ""The first thing, like any addiction is knowing that you need to and actually wanting to quit.  I smoked for 20 years and quit just recently (second time I have actually tried).  Last time, I took Chantix and it worked well.  What didn't work well was saying that it was ok for me to continue to smoke cigars on the weekends.  A couple of drunk weekends six months down the road led me back into cigs.  This time, nothing at all will be smoked.

My friend is quitting also right now and is having a hard time in life.  He is using that as an excuse, and I don't blame him, but anyone can find an excuse.  The hardest part is telling yourself that it is just an excuse and that smoking doesn't fix anything, ever."Plain and simple. You have to actually want to.I would feel like a real asshole if I got cancer and had to burden my family because of smoking. Something I inflicted on myself. "My mom & sister got hypnotized. It was covered under health care and free, and it worked for both of them. They haven't smoked in 3 years!

My other sister got hypnotized too, but it didn't work on her, and she does still smoke, so I guess it doesn't work for everyone.""No money and my girlfriend out of town I had no way of getting them.  I begged whoever I could find,  smoked my old butts, but in the end a week went by and i just didn't need them anymore. ""The patch. It is a six week process, and it worked for me both times I quit. I left it on 24/7 to avoid morning cravings and got some bonus lucid dreams. Sunflower seeds and lots of chewing gum helped to deal with the oral fixation. It totally works to get you over the chemical addiction and break the habit. I haven't smoked in three years. ""My kids. I was a smoker for over 22 years with small stages of being quit and once again had promised my kids that after New Year's Eve, I would put them down forever. That did  not happen of course and about midway through January 2012 my 12 year old daughter and 7 year old son sat me down for a talk. They explained to me that they understood now that it was okay to lie to the people you love so long as you are enjoying whatever it is you are lieing about. Kids are too smart for me. I put the cigarettes down and have not touched one since.""Chantix. You have to start taking it while you're smoking. Once it starts taking effect after a week or two you will stop getting a buzz when you have that first smoke in the morning. (they say to quit one week after taking chantix, It took me 3 or 4 weeks before I finally started to put them down) You may continue to smoke until you think you are ready. Once you say, ok, I'm ready to quit now.. you may do ok for a while.. but then you may slip up and have one because you are out having a drink with friends or something. You smoke that cigarette, but get no buzz, no satisfaction out of it. If you had quit cold turkey, that one cigarette would have set you back, but if you're taking chantix, it blocks the nicotine receptors in your brain, so the addiction cycle has not been restarted.
It basically makes you go through the physical withdrawls from the nicotene while you're still smoking.. giving you time to work out the mental part on your own.""It's been 300 days since I last quit. I used to smoke up to 6 cigarettes a day on average. 

What worked for me:First off, I never realised that that I would actually crave for cigarettes. But, slowly one or two months before I actually quit, I was unable to stomach the fact that I was inhaling a burning paper filled with random dried herbs directly pushing a burning crop into my lungs. It started off with a feeling like cooties for a injection, I slowly could no longer get myself to inhale it. Like how one would ""shudder"" or ""dread"" the pinch of the injection as a kid, I could no longer inhale burning smoke directly into my lungs with ease.

This slowly evolved into such a big dread that I finally stopped one  day. Cold turkeyed myself and told myself you are going to avoid that shit however long you can. 
At first, for like 2-3months it was ""however long I can hold out"". Using the factors mentioned below I led my life as a non-smoker. What I did not realise is, once I had those factors mastered, I was no longer going to ""hold out however long I want"", after 6 months I had quit. I was only going to ""begin smoking again"" if I went back to it. I remain in this state and am proud. I now offer helpful advice and occasionally request my friends to quit smoking.


Factors that helped me stay off smoking again:

1. I did a 30minute youtube self hypnosis to not smoke. I have no proof that actually worked, but I have never smoked after doing that.

2. Self-restraint: I started craving for a smoke the morning of any exam or important day. Drank coffee, and had a banana instead.
3. Say 'no' to friends and people who offer you / ask you if you'd like to smoke. This goes A LONG WAY. LEARN TO SAY NO. You only ever have to say it once or maximum twice to a person and they will not bother you. 
4. Stay indoors and involve yourself in immersive habits and work.
5. You CAN STILL bond over cigarettes, you no longer need to smoke to bond over cigarettes. Example: you meet a new person who asks if you want to go for a smoke outside, instead of being a snob and saying ""no I'll just stay here"" or something you can just go, stand and talk while the other person smokes. However, you must avoid this if you believe it will cause you to cave in.


Wrapping up, it's always within you. It's not hard once you have the willpower and self-confidence.

Good Luck.""Just get pissed off at ciggerettes for ruling your life.  Exsmoker 5years now.
I tried all the quitting stuff including ecigs don't waste your money,just get pissed as hell.
(25 year smoker)""It's very very simple. Don't pick up a cig. Just don't. ""Oh but it's hard."" Then you don't want to quit too bad. 

I smoked a pack a day for like 7 years and quit by refusing to pick up a smoke. Tough yes but very simple. ""I started dating a non-smoker. Even though he wouldn't get angry with me when I came home smelling like a cigarette, I knew he could tell and it wasn't a smell he would ideally like to put his mouth on. Eventually I just decided I was tired of de-cigging my scent for him, and I stopped. I also did it for myself, but it was so easy to do it with someone else you care about in mind. ""The decision to be a parent.  When we came to the conclusion that we were as ready to be parents as we would ever be, I tossed my last pack in the trash can and we were expecting two weeks later.  Of course, I didn't know that part for another four weeks.  Haven't slipped once.""I'd tried over the years, but I guess I just didn't want to quit bad enough. A little over a year and a half ago, I had just come in from a smoke break. at work, and was like ""I want to quit."" I still had half a carton of cigarettes at home and a whole pack in my possession. I had just had enough of it. Told my co-workers, and aside from the first weekend REALLY messing with my anxiety issues, I have not looked back at all. I've been to bars, clubs, and other places where I've been tempted in the past, and the smell just nauseates me now. I did it cold turkey -- didn't even use suckers like I had in the past for the oral fixation (which was my biggest downfall before). I guess it was just time for me.

But really, you just gotta be ready and actually want it. Not for someone else, not because people say it's bad for you, but because YOU want to quit. And like /u/kirkirus said, the first few days of withdrawal are kind of hell, so I would be somewhere you're not going to ruin friendships/work relationships. I had massive anxiety issues before I quit, and the withdrawal made them worse for those three days. 

After the first week, any time I would get a craving, I'd ask myself, ""Do I really want to start ALL over again?"" The answer was always HELL NO, because that first week sucked a lot. I did NOT wanna go through that again.""First, you have to really want to quit. I don't mean oh I should probably quit blah blah blah. I mean you really have to want it. I tried a few times and failed. Deep down I knew I didn't want to stop. I enjoyed smoking. Then one night my husband and I were home relaxing after an evening out and could smell the smoke on us and were disgusted. We decided that we were done and haven't smoked since. We both smoked for at least 10 years and quit cold turkey. February will be 2 years! We stayed away from bars for a few weeks and asked our friends to support us. I skipped the smoke breaks with co-workers and stayed inside for a few weeks. I am not part of that ""group"" anymore, but now us non-smokers have made our own ""smoke break group"" and take breaks in our break room or go for short walks around the building. My husbands trick that he swears by was drinking SanPellegrino. Really anything citrus helps cut the cravings. I think the key was truly wanting to quit this time. We didn't pick a date or say we are going to finish this last pack. I don't even remember how many we had left in the pack. We just stopped. Sure there were headaches and moodiness at first. Just warn everyone around you and ask for their patience and support. Also, don't replace one bad habit with another.
"The thing that worked for me and my friends was working out and or girl friends. Real shit kiddies "I know three months isn't very long, but it's still been a great feeling. ""This may seem silly, but I really just lost interest in smoking. Granted, I had only smoked for a couple of years, and never more than half a pack of day. At some point, I just got bored of it. Which is especially strange because I have a very addictive personality - I've gone through a couple of drug addictions in the past, and they have been difficult to overcome. But cigarettes not so much."I'm with you there. I realized they were causing stress not removing it. Plus they make you feel shittey."First, I decided never to buy a pack of cigarettes again. I forced my self to roll my own. I started with the better rolling tobacco (Bali Shag) and worked down to the shitty rolling tobacco (Top, Bugler). I still needed that nicotine fix but the cigarettes were so eye-wateringly strong and gross I started to kind of hate them. Secondly, I scheduled a strict regimen of when I'd get my ""dose""-- One cigarette after each meal, solely, which was 3 a day. If I missed one, tough shit, have to wait until the next dose. I stopped putting tobacco in my spliffs, and made a rule that I would smoke absolutely NO blunts. After a year of 3 cigarettes a day, I decided I would cut it down to ONE cigarette a day, after dinner. After six months of that, it's sort of like ""if I'm only smoking one, why even bother?"" and I quit, fully and wholeheartedly. After 4 weeks the cravings were completely gone. I quit five and a half years ago, and while I have tried to take drags off cigarettes occasionally, I can't even finish a cigarette without vomiting now.

You need to layer your nicotine. Use the patch AND gum. Or patch and e-cig. After a week or two you can go off the patch. This worked fairly well for me, but I did continue to use the gum for 1-2 years.

I use dip pouches, cleaner and more enjoyable, either camel snus or skoal, mint flavoured on both. It gives the oral fixation rest, and has nicotine. I've cut back to a pipe, no inhaling, and one cigarette a week.

I went cold turkey with the help of a Naturopath.  She helped me in a few ways; talked to me about strategies, desired results, talked about symptoms, and gave me some things to help with some of the non-withdrawl related, physical symptoms associated with quitting (constipation, restless legs, difficulty sleeping).

I tried to quit about 5 times in the past; tried the patch/gum/substitute method, Alan Carr's book, cold turkey, gradual reduction, and none of them stuck.  I really feel that having someone to help draw out and verbalize your goals is helpful; I felt much more responsible to the task, to myself, and to her as a partner in my quitting. 

If I can recommend one thing, it's to get someone on your side who you will feel responsible to and who will help you through.  Plan your quit with them and keep them involved.

(Surprisingly, riding for a few minutes will actually give you MORE energy!) As your cardiovascular health improves cigarettes will start to taste REALLY bad.

And if you still feel ""too weak"" then add Chantix to the mix!!! Several people I know were successful using Chantix. Others quit with electronic cigarettes. Too me that is just trying to find a healthier way to continue feeding the addiction. By quitting completely you will appreciate the extra cash in your pocket too!!!

Just keep imagining that every time you refrain from smoking then you are helping your body to withdrawal the drug. You are letting the toxins go! Your mind and spirit are getting stronger every time you resist the temptation. By the time the first four days is over then you should realize that your body should have removed the majority of that junk out.
""Well even though it kinda has been said before quiting cold turkey is what worked for me, though I have to say I had some other tricks up my sleeve to.  
I smoked for 13 years and in that time I tried often to quit but never really managed more then a couple of months.  

Last time I quit, I realized what had gone wrong the other times. I tried to fight the habits that i connected to smoking,  
Waiting for the bus, let's smoke. I found a lot of things to do instead, read books when ever I wait for the bus, eat oranges whenever i need a break from work.  

But I think the most significant change in my life that helped me was that I found a new apartment, which i was moving to. I decided that my last day smoking was the last day in the previous apartment and since then I haven't smoked. 
 

""Time. Smoking took all my time. I could go iron a shirt for work or smoke a cigarette. When I finally realized I always went with the cigarette, I decided to take back my time and went cold turkey. 

Walking off them is not as hard physically as everybody says, you just need to get the mental crutch and you'll go. 

Use everything you can to prop yourself up. I read 10 pages of an Alan Carr book. I never smoked afterwards because I didn't want to ever have to read drivel like it again. 

Be prepared to gain some weight for a month or two while you adjust to your winning ways. Compromise on other things but not on your determination to take back your time and be the master of your own destiny.""My grandpa just up and quit. One day he was chain smoking, put the next cig in his mouth and lit it, only to realize there was already an entire cigarette still burning in his mouth. At that point he decided he was done""I hated smoking, so quitting was easier. Quit smoking in certain places. Start at home. Never smoke at home. Then a liitle bit later, add the car, never smoke in the car, and etc. Last, add your work. By then you'll be smoking maybe three four cigarettes a day. Smoking is about habit. Break those habits one by one.""My father went with hypnosis which worked for him.  I went cold turkey.  I should say I have gone back to smoking a few times.  I use logic and circumstance when I'm ready.  I once quit for 5 years because of a snowstorm, I didn't want to go outside and my cravings stopped after about 24 hours so I kept going.  I also get bronchitis every year or so and I have to not smoke, so that showed me I could do it.  Have a strong reason to keep saying no to smoking and I gained about 10 pounds or so in the weeks after.""I smoked for 2 years and quit cigarettes cold turkey initially. When I would drink and REALLY crave a cig I would have nicotine gum and even did chewing tobacco a handful of times (disgusting I know).

It's been a little over a year since I've had a cigarette but I recently bought a high end e-cig online that I use specifically when I'm drunk. I never get the urge to smoke it when I'm sober.

Ecigs all the way people. Maybe not technically ""cold turkey"" but its 100000x better for you than actually smoking.""Cold turkey.

One day I just looked at the pack, thought about how I was allowing some company to control not only my life, but how I'll exit life. Admittedly I was a 2edgy4me/adbusters sort of person at the time, but as ridiculous now as that angst was, that thought was disgusting enough to keep me going through all the times when I was craving. I threw the pack out the car window (I knew if I held onto it, I was going to smoke again) and didn't replace it.

I also set a date for myself. I had heard somewhere (don't know or really care if it's true or not) that 90 days is roughly what it takes to rid yourself of a habit. 90 days later I no longer craved it at all when I was around friends who smoked.

I guess I was a pretty good example. My parents ended up quitting just a few months after I did, neither of them smoke anymore either (aside from the occasional cigar). They both quit cold-turkey as well, but my dad ended up using Bupropion. He and I were rebuilding a pretty broken relationship at the time, and I was around a lot more than I used to be, so the fact that I wouldn't come outside to join him for a smoke might have helped, too.""I forced myself to think of the cigarette as a delicacy rather than a requirement for me to get through the day. Like I'll have one a day and it will be a reward. Eventually I would get to that cigarette and the result wouldn't be as great as I thought in my head or I would forget about my ""reward"" altogether. This progressed until I didn't want one anymore at all, I grew out of them because I realized they weren't as great and stress-relieving as my mind convinced me they were. ""I went to my dentist, and he gave me a prescription for this plastic thing that came apart. Inside of it you put a small nicotine pack and you closed it up. Then you could suck out of it, getting the nicotine you needed.

This was important because it fulfilled the need for the physical motion of smoking a cig.

Ive been going 7 years, and on 8 now without a smoke, I can hardly remember when I did smoke. It is great!""Cut out your triggers -- this probably means not hanging out with the same friends that you hang out with in the same way. If you generally sit around a bar with your amigos, change it up and invite them to do something that doesn't immediately make you think of smoking. 

Also, never, ever, ever walk into a convenience store. I never see this advice, but if you cut out your daily trip into the gas station, you won't be presented with the opportunity to buy cigs. 

""I had smoked for 8 years and was smoking Camel Wides for a couple of those years. One of my best friends and I decided we should quit and we both just quit cold turkey. He started smoking again but I never did. 

My sister has tried to quit several times and always has a mental breakdown and starts crying, screaming etc. I think it really comes down to what other people have said and that's willpower. You need to be able to tell yourself you don't *have* to smoke to get by. There are very few things you have to do, everything else is a want. The same applies to quitting smoking. You don't want to smoke, so don't. You want to quit, so do. ""Cold turkey, got a friend of mine to quit with me as well, so that helped a bit. ""I figured that the times I used to smoke was when I sat in a specific environment (with certain friends) and at specific times, like the waking-up cigarette, after lunch, with coffee, after dinner, and especially at bars where I was out drinking. So I kind of stopped being there or keeping myself occupied in these times, like I used to be with my boss during lunch, who hated smokers, so I tried not to smoke at that hours, I moved to juice from coffee (its just not the same taste with juice) and I stopped going to the bars with the people I smoked around with, it took time, I mean one is always thinking of going back and having one cigarette, and thats because the cold turkey starts to kick in. After i crossed this time, whenever I used to smell the cigarette smoke in the air, it just felt unpleasant. Except when I was drunk, that always made me go back, but then grew over that phase too and stopped being so shit-face drunk.

Tl;dr- Try to alter your environment/times where/when you tend to smoke. And second, one needs to go through cold-turkey.""I quit using tobacco in the begining of December using Ecigs, the thought of using tobacco is now a thing of the past. I enjoy nicotine as much as I do caffeine,  they are both stimulants that, when used in moderation, have nominal health risks.  I don't have plans on quitting ecigs, its a guilt free way to ingest a small amount of a stimulant throughout my day.  My nic level is only 5 mg (considered very light) and I cut down from 12mg so I can use it more without feeling too ramped up."My Grandfather got lung cancer."I got my first massive anxiety attack, thought it was a heart attack, went to the ER and told myself that I will never light another cigarette in my life and haven't since. It will be a year on 1st of February. If it wasn't for this, I would never do it. ""Smoking is such a waste of money.

At $5 a pack, excluding investments, you would have $54,750 in savings at one pack a day. Now, that doesnt sound like a lot of money at first, but think about it this way: If you didnt buy one pack a day and you saved that money instead and invested it into mutual funds and got an 8% return over the long term, you would have $228,587 in 30 years! But thats not even the end to the savings!


If you used this money to pay off the principle of your Mortgage and Car loans early, not only do you save money on the cost of those loans, but you wouldnt pay 4% interest on them both! Thats 8% (roughly) interest you would have been paying! But not only that,

You could invest that money you would have spent on interest on the mortgage loans and gain 8% in the markets with little to no risk. You stopped smoking, saved on insurance cost, saved on mortgage and car loans, and pay for your retirement. All from not smoking! Hooray! Now do you still feel like having a cig?"My wife's nagging. No joke. That's how I quit. "Going to ask a question here...how can I get a family member or someone close to stop smoking? Ultimately I understand it's not for me to decide, but is there a way?"Champix"Will power. I smoked for 15 years. Grow some balls and try to pick up other things worth you time. Read, exercise, don't hang with people that smoke. Good luck""My doctor told me how bad my bloodwork was, basically laid out that I had heart health of someone twice my age and that I'd have the headstone to match if I didn't do something about it.  My triglycerides and LDL levels were double the threshold for ""high"" at age 30 and 190 lbs. (I'm 6'2"".)  He gave me three months to get it under control with diet and lifestyle changes before he started me on any prescriptions, and when I asked about possible contributing factors the biggest one that I felt I could realistically change was smoking.  I threw out the half a pack I had left after exiting the doctor's office and that was it.  Half a week of crankiness later and I was over the worst of it.  Three months later my levels were right at the threshold of ""high"" instead of double, and my doctor decided it wasn't quite time for medication yet.  That was the only major lifestyle change, by the way.  No additional exercise, maybe a little more fiber in my diet (bowl of oatmeal for breakfast once in a while), and no smoking.  That's all it took.

tl;dr - ""YOU'RE GOING TO DIE"" is a much more powerful motivator for quitting smoking when it comes in the form of potential heart failure by 35 as opposed to cancer at 70.""Not a smoker myself, but a coworker from a couple years ago had been a smoker for 20+ years. One day he came into work and said he was going to quit that day, and we all laughed. But he actually did it and hasn't smoked at all in the past 2 years. He still went outside on breaks and cut plastic straws into cigarette-sized pieces to chew on. Something about keeping his routine the same made it easier for him to quit. Maybe it would work for you too?""My girlfriend of 4 years told me at the beginning of us dating 
"" getitgirl1, if you smoke, then we don't have sex."" 
Officially of the cigarettes for 3 years 2 months and, 21 days.""Cold turkey may have the best results but everyone is different. Telling people its the only way makes it so that alot of people don't even try because they feel they don't have the will power. I quit after starting with champex then when that wasn't working I got Alan Carr's easyway on audio book on my phone that way it was always with me to cheer me on worked like a charm for me.  So study after study that shows cold turkey as the best does not take into account of the brain washing by people saying its that only way. The goal is to quit do what you got to do to do it. 

Edit: although in the end there will always be that last smoke and its cold turkey from there on. ""As said before. Cold turkey. It works wonders. However, the oral fixation was a big thing for me so I chewed toothpicks for a while when I was quitting and that helped a lot. 

TL;DR Cold Turkey+Chew Toothpicks"(Smoked for 12 years) 3.5 years ago I quit smoking and started dipping Copenhagen. Then I started chewing the nicotine gum about a year ago and ended up addicted to it. 6 months ago I weened off the gum with orbit and nicotine patches. I don't even have cravings anymore!"I quit 3 years ago using Chantix. It never thought that it would work so well but it did. I really don't even think about smoking anymore. It's almost as if I never smoked in the first place. I never had any of the negative side effects either, but everyone reacts differently to Chantix."maybe you have tried the wrong ecigs   http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/Honestly cold turkey and time. After 15 years of smoking (age 15 to 30)I tried the patch and smoked more with it then with out(Just gave me a constant craving for a cigarette). Tried gum and could never remember to actually take it places. Tried the electronic cigarettes and they just weren't as satisfying. Nobody likes a quitter.Electronic cigarette"[Chantix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varenicline)! In non-american countries it's called Champix. You just take some pills for a few weeks and the need to smoke very quickly subsides. I had been smoking for around 5 years and quit in less than a week using these pills.

You have to keep taking them for a while, and while you do you should focus on getting rid of the habitual part of smoking. Figure out what to do in the scenarios where you would usually have a cigarette. Replace the habit with something else, and in the long run you wont even need the ""else"".

The only side-effects that I experienced was mild nausea shortly after taking the pill, especially if I hadn't eaten - and *insanely* vivid dreams! The last part was really fun and very often had lucid dreams where I knew I was dreaming and could conciously make choices within the dream.

After taking the pills for some weeks I ended up selling the remaining pills to a friend who wanted to quit because I felt like I didn't need them anymore.

It's been 1 year and 3 weeks now since I quit, and not once have I craved for a cigarette!

Good luck.""I smoked for more than 10 years. Starting with a pack a day then two packs a day. I never really wanted to quit but I HAD to because I was very short on money at that time. So I had to choose between smoking or food.
I set a date and smoked my last cigarette on August 18th 2013 at 03:00 and went cold turkey. No champix, stickers or any other kind of medicine, just straight cold turkey. It was hard at the beginning, especially the first week but I'm on this site that keeps your days and after X days/weeks you get a picture/medal thingy. I recently got my 150 day picture:) 

What helped me the most in the beginning was water. I'm talking LOTS of water. I had 5-6 bottles of water in my refrigerator at all times and whenever I was behind my pc, I had a bottle of water near me. Whenever I had an urge to smoke, I took a sip of water. I remember going to the bathroom a lot more at first and that helped me as well. Meditation has been a great help for me as well, it's a great way to deal with addiction.

What was most important to me was that I take it slow and I always said to myself ""I can't smoke I DON'T have the money"". That's how I motivated myself and pulled myself through the first week or two. After that all the other things started motivating me like, my improved health, no more stinking, food that tastes better, people no longer frown at me for being near them and so on!

What I'm most proud of, and I think it might help other people, is that I took this battle against nicotine day by day and I kept count. Every single day that I didn't smoke was a victory.""I left my old lifestyle completely.

I left my city, left my friends, moved abroad and cycled all the way there. I had to quite 2months before the cycling so it didn't kill me.

Every day I wasn't smoking I was looking at everyone who did and thinking ""I'm better than you"". The boost to my ego was enough to do it.

Once away from everyone and everything you don't need in your life it's easier to create the person you want to be.""My wife quit... which pretty much meant I was quitting. But seriously it has to be a conscious wholehearted decision, until then relapse is inevitable. I quit on NYE so I'm at 30 days today... that's like almost officially an ex-smoker. ""10 years ago when Ireland banned smoking in all public places I quit, couldn't be arsed having to stand outside so smoke. I remember that last night in the pub, I must have smoked 40 cigarettes, there were people who never go to the pub there just for the novelty of being among the last pub smokers in Ireland. ""I smoked for 16yrs and used a combo if chantrix and becoming an aunt.  My sister sent me a pic of my baby nephew everyday asking if I wanted him to know me as a smoker.  And no, no i didn't!  But how I physically did it with chantrix. The drug has horrible side effects, and I got off it as quick as possible.  But what my doc told me side effect less than smoking (although watch for suicidal thoughts).  Been 5  yrs, and can imagine starting again.""For me, watching how nasty people look while smoking was the nail in the coffin. You just have to decide that you don't want it anymore and constantly remind yourself that it's a waste of time, money, and health. ""Might not help you, or anyone else really but the one thing that stopped me smoking cigarettes was weed. Honestly , My rationale was that I would rather get high than turn off nicotine cravings and to my surprise I didnt really want any tobacco while I was high, this probably wont help you at work though :P""It's been 11 months, 1 day, 16 hours since I had my last cigarette. I use an iPhone app called QuitIt to track the time. I'll check it every week or so just to remind myself of when I quit. It's free. 

The only thing that helped me to quit was Chantix. That stuff is amazing. I was smoking a pack a day for almost 7 years. I'd tried quitting cold turkey a few times but the longest I ever went was a month. 

Even with Chantix, it took 3 tries over the course of two years before it finally stuck. Each time completely worked and I'd quit, but being around friends that smoked kept pulling me back in. Most of my friends have stopped smoking since then, so that combined with just being completely done with it has led to this last time being permanent. 

People talk a lot of shit about Chantix. Like any medication, it surely has some bad symptom for a tiny, less than a tenth of a percent of people. But for *most* people, it's fine. 

You get some vivid dreams. Not nightmares, just super techno color versions of normal dreams. 

You keep smoking like normal, but over the course of 2-3 weeks, you start noticing the cigarettes taste bad. You also start losing the compulsive need to smoke. Within a month, you just don't want to smoke any more because it's gross. 

I could talk about the biology of how it works, but don't have the time. 

If you really want to quit, but like me and have a slightly addictive personality and cold turkey doesn't work, I highly recommend trying it. ""Doing Ibogaine and fucking my brains out.

Protip : Don't expect to do both at the same time.""Electronic cigarettes have been really wonderful, if you're someone who likes to smoke but knows it's terrible for you. ""I tried many times, but to actually get me to quit was my organism. A year and a half ago I bought my last pack of cigarettes, and I didn't enjoy smoking at all anymore, so I stopped. And when I saw somebody smoking - I found myself instead of starving for a cigarette, being happy I don't need to do that anymore. Right now I never think about having a cigarette, and I am happy that I saved so much money because of thath.""I quit cold turkey but with the aid of ""The easy way to quit smoking"" by Allen Carr. The book was a crutch for me during the first few weeks as those are the most brutal. 

He makes a lot of parallels with cigarettes and heroin usage in that you're only smoking because you're addicted. You don't actually like it.
I carried that thing with me everywhere and every time I felt an urge I'd pick up the book and read little pieces of it to remind myself that it's an addiction vs a pleasure which I used to think.

Best of luck on quitting and know that it will be one of the best life decisions you can make."Dip."As a stepstone, switch to pipe smoking. It's time consuming (to prepare the pipe, smoke it, clean it) and you will convert a periodic event into something more of a ritual. Then trim down on that progressively. 

""Go on holiday. A change of scenery, travel no stress and none of your traditional smoking cues. Worked for me. "Just stop buying them. "Honestly, treating them like candy bars. I dont buy packs anymore but ill have one every so often and it helps get me out of the habit""Not my story but my father quit.

He said once when I was younger I had the chicken pox disease. Although it's not very dangerous for kids, it can get extremly dangerous for adults. My father told me now 10 years later, that he almost died from it. He spend days to weeks on the couch trying to recover from it. As he saw himself in the mirror almost looking like a dead body, he decided he wanted to live a healthier life. And he stopped smoking cigs, drinking coffe and alcohol that day and never got back to it. He still has his last pack of tobacco untouched in the drawer. My father is a strong man.""Getting involved with a trail running community. Group support, competitive reasons not to smoke, attractive people in spandex hugging me. 3 years later and I'm running ultra, not smokin 2 packs a day, and having a blast.""I started doing Brazilian jiujitsu and I was just so into it, I didn't want anything to mess up my bjj game. I was also lifting weights and adjusting my diet so I would have enough protein and carbs for energy, I became more health conscious and it didn't make sense to undermine all these things I valued by smoking cigarettes.  

So I read Allan Carr's ""Easy way to stop smoking"" Canadian edition, which my uncle had  given me 2 years earlier. The premise of the book is that you are more psychologically addicted to nicotine than you are physically addicted.  You are actually supposed to keep smoking until you finish the book.

That's how I quit after almost 10 years smoking. 

Tl;dr: I set quitting smoking as a worthwhile pursuit in my mind and read Allan Carr's ""Easy way.""""I smoked for 15 years. 
Back in 2006 I saw a newspaper AD about a full day seminar based on the ""Easyway"" method by Allen Carr. 
They were claiming the 80% of success, and they told me that if I wouldn't quit in the next three months, I would get refunded of my money.

So I told myself: ""even if I quit for only a couple months"" that's health gained!

I went to that seminar knowing that I was actually enjoying smoking, and we were encouraged to smoke throughout the day.

No shock methods were involved but only the realization of why you're actually putting your cigarette in your mouth.

I quit that same day, 8 years ago. Never looked back.""I was never a heavy smoker, maybe 1/2 pack a day for about 10 - 15 years. When I was finally ready to quit, I read a book called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. It was kind of a tedious read, but it breaks down all the reasons you think you enjoy smoking so by the end of the book you don't even want a cigarette anymore. 

I was able to quit while living in the Middle East where packs were $1.50 and you could smoke anywhere. Been smoke-free for almost a decade now and that book was a big reason why.

(I'm not affiliated with Allen Carr in any way shape or form. In fact I downloaded his book as a PDF so I'm not even a paying customer :P)""Cold. Turkey.

Alternative sources of nicotine leave you still addicted, and e-Cigs leave you hooked on the oral AND chemical aspect. 

I smoked for 26 years. Patches gave me a rash, gum was nasty, and Chantix was scary. I lit up for the last time in the wee hours of January 1, 2009, making sure it was my last one in the pack. I got up later that day, and thought ""I'm gonna see how long I can go today without a smoke."" 

Through lunch, through dinner, all the way to bedtime, I used my infinite powers of procrastination to just keep putting my next smoke off for five more minutes. 

That was my key - don't look at it as this huge lifetime thing. Just don't smoke right now. You can put off smoking for a few minutes, you've done it a million times. Just put it off for a while. Connect the whiles.

You're going to be a crabby bitch. Warn those around you. If they give the tiniest shit about you, they'll deal with your moods. The first three days are kinda rough, then it starts to smooth out. Sometime in month three, your brain will deactivate the nicotine receptors that cause the physical addiction. For me, that was more uncomfortable than the first three days. Crazy cravings in my itchy brain for a week or so. Then it's gone... the physical need I mean. The mental habit never completely goes away. A moment of stress, a really good meal, something will trigger the old knee-jerk reaction to light up. 

Chuckle at your silly brain's old dead habit, and continue living healthier, happier, and with more money in your pocket.

You may gain a bit of weight, yes, because food tastes and smells better now, and your mouth craves something to do... but you can do more physical things and breathe better now too. Walk off the cravings, jog in place until you're winded, do pushups. Use the nicotine frustration to power your way through. I gained 30 pounds over two years, and have already lost 20 of them just walking briskly for 20 minutes a day - far less time than I used to spend freezing/sweating outside smoking. 

26 years a smoker, five years nicotine-free this month. You can do it.""I quit because I had a new girlfriend who I really wanted to make a good impression with. I also wanted to make out with her without grossing her out and smelling like ass. 

Being able to kiss new girlfriend was a great motivator. Also I went cold turkey. ""I quit the day I found out I was pregnant, cold turkey, it was really hard but I found not putting a cigarette ibetween my lips and lighting it definitely helped. Good luck x""Electronic cigarette. 

I tried the ones you're probably using (liquor store cheap ones) and ended up smoking real ones anyway. 

I then spent a long time researching different models of ""high end"" e-cigs and ended up spending $100 on the device and all the stuff associated with it; juice, extra atomizers, etc. 

Well worth the cost. I never had to make another order, I successfully quit (last one in April 2013) and now I don't even use the e-cig. 

Good luck! ""7years in 3years out.

LSD and DMT. Sounds like a longshot but over a period of time, ego manipulation and self evaluation on these drugs I came to a point where I was disgusted with smoking. I didnt understand what, if any benefit I was getting from it. I told myself cigarettes helped when I was stressed, kept me from eating too much, were relaxing and so on... But really they only gave my hands something to do and tricked me into thinking I felt resolved. Never did I get any benefit from them and that made me feel like an idiot. 

I met my girlfriend, we started dating and then she started talking about a future with me. On top of my psychedelic found disgust in my habit I started thinking about marriage and children and life.... I put out my last cigarette and declared I was done. Havnt smoked since. No tapering, no craving, no thougts... The only way and real way to quit is to want to... If you dont want to, you have no chance. Really look at your life... Can you really say you LIKE smoking? You know what you would like? An extra $5 in your pocket every day... All you have to do is want it bad enough and its yours.""I decreased from 1/2 pack a day to few cigs a week, when me and hubby started to talk children. 10 years of on/off smoking stopped the minute the test was positive."edibles and vaping.. blunts hurt my throat and made me cough "I also believe Cold Turkey is best. My story adds to that. I was buying smokes online in around 2002 because I could still buy from indian reservations for about $10 a carton. When I got a large shipment in one day I was disgusted at the cost. I decided to quit, like many do ""after these"" but instead of a pack or carton, it was 10 cartons. So every day I pulled a pack from the pyramid of smokes I made on my dresser, my sub-conscience knew I was one more day closer to being a non smoker.
By the time I hit the last 3 packs, I couldn't even inhale anymore and they tasted nasty. I was done! I guess the added time I had for my brain to learn not to smoke helped because I had failed many times before that.
My last cig was feb 1 2003.

TL/DR It takes time to teach and old brain new tricks. ""I tried gum, patch, etc... the only thing that actually worked for me was the fear and shame of letting down my significant other whom i'd promised that I would quit. It worked so effectively that now years later, I do not like the smell or taste of smoke and don't have cravings. It was a very intense feeling and worked perfectly!"Getting a job in health care where smoking was very frowned upon.  I quit cold turkey.  Peer pressure ftw!Electronic cigarette. Head over to /r/ECR to get advices for good starter pack."I don't know if I am considered ab ex smoker but I smoked for the better part of a year and then quit cold turkey, haven't had one since April of 2013""A week ago I bought a refillable e cig. That has helped a lot, as well as having a friend who is quitting with me. She has bummed a couple of cigarettes, but I chapped her ass about it and she doesn't do it anymore.""For me, it was chantix, combined with quitting during the summer (major trigger) and avoiding most triggers (coffee, drinking, bars).  After the 1st month, I didn't have cravings.  Also, taking a walk during your smoke break instead of smoking."Was in a long distance relationship for a year in a 3 year relationship. She hated it. Got engaged a few weeks ago. Quit it immediately. I don't feel any difference in my life now. Except that I don't know what to do on smoke breaks. "I'll tell you what worked for me, take or leave the parts you can use. I had the opportunity to quit when I moved to a new city and didn't know anyone. Not hanging out with smokers was probably the #1 biggest help. #2 was using the patch. In my experience the patch takes the edge off the anger you get with withdraw, but helps very little with the urge to smoke itself. If you know how the patch will help, you won't rely on it for what it wont help you with. #3 for me was the mental battle with myself. Myself would work 24/7 convincing myself that I should have a cigarette. Once I new that was going to happen I was able to recognize it for what it was and it helped me.""Zyban, a few pieces of gun (not many) and that's about it. I took the zyban for about a month before I quit smoking. It made everything taste weird and I just woke up one day and didn't smoke."stop it ...stop it right meow Starting with two of the maximum dose patches.I'd smoked for 12 years. 20 a day. Cigarettes were expensive. When I bought property the agent lied about the service charges and I couldn't afford to smoke unless I didn't eat. My will to survive was stronger than the will to smoke. After 3 months I got a raise but the habit was broken. Almost 10 years free now. "Ex 30 a day smoker. I stopped smoking when i got a really nasty, chesty cold. It worked , i assume, because a) I was less inclined to have a cigarette when i was coughing my guts up making cold turkey easier and  b) I related the severity of my cough to my smoking, so , whenever I felt tempted, I pictured myself with that nasty cough to put me off. ""Everyone I've recommended this to has quit... it's a bit unconventional, but it works.  I smoked packs a day for 8 years, quit once, started again a year later and smoked for two years, then quit again and that time for good.  I've been smoke\nicotine free for 6 years now.

Find a long weekend where you can literally shirk just about all responsibilities for 3-4 days.  A lame holiday like MLK Jr. day where there isn't a lot of family stuff, etc going on works great.  On the day you decide to quit, go as long as you can without having a smoke.  The second you know you're going to cave, go outside an jog for 30 minutes.  It's going to suck balls, but just fucking do it.  As soon as you step back into your house\apt\abode take a sedating dose of benadryl.  About 50-75mgs.  Take a shower, by the time your shower is over you'll be ready to fall asleep.  

Repeat as necessary.  Sure, you'll lose your entire weekend, but after the 2nd or 3rd day, you will get surprising relief from the exercise and you won't need to sleep through the craving.

It sounds stupid, but it's not dangerous and it works.""Whenever I wanted to go for a smoke, I ate something really tasty. I am amazed to this day how relatively easy it was to substitute tobacco with food. Not just any food, it has to be really munchy/crunchy/tasty!""Rubber Band Method: place a strong rubber band around your wrist. When you feel a craving pull that sucker back as far as it will go and let'r go..WHAP! Then say, ""I don't want to be addicted any more"" 10 times. (you can just think it). Two weeks and you will not want to smoke again.""I know how to stop smoking.

The addiction in smoking isn't nicotine, it's dopamine. Every time you light up, your brain gives itself a nice little burst of the most enjoyable drug known to science.

Being a long-term smoker means you've trained your brain to deliver dopamine whenever you smoke. It's not just the act of smoking, because the brain learns to anticipate - from the second you *decide* to have a smoke, as you get up, walk out, get out your pack, put one in your mouth, and light it up... the whole time your brain is licking it's squidgy lips at the thought of all that dopamine it's going to receive.

You can only stop smoking by retraining your brain to deliver dopamine every time you *reject* a cigarette.

This is why ex-smokers so quickly become holier-than-thou. Because the feeling of smugness is an excellent way to put dopamine into your brain. ""I'm better than those idiots still smoking"" - this is the type of thought that will give you a dopamine buzz as long as you truly believe it.

I don't know what the answer is for *you*. But unless you find a way to turn off the connection between smoking and dopamine production, you are going to have a very difficult time quitting, and staying quit.

edit: I should mention that I still smoke after 30 years. But I've had more serious problems to worry about - I'm just this week clean after 4 years in a methadone program. The funny thing is that I'm in excellent health for someone my age, smoker or not. I think the primary reason is that I stopped drinking alcohol 20 years ago, and stopped overeating about 10 years ago.

The second thing perhaps worth mentioning is the value of cutting back. I tried various things and none of them seemed to work. Then I tried smoking a pipe. Traditional pipe tobacco is a fucking wet mess and is actually kind of tricky to use. What I do now is buy a pack of cigarettes and break them up to get the tobacco out. Then I smoke it through a pipe. Usually one or two puffs is all I take when I would previously have a whole cigarette.

This way, one pack lasts me about two weeks. I was previously on 30-40 cigarettes a day.

I'm not particularly interested in the difficulty of giving up completely. I've had enough of that in recent years with my other vices. At this reduced level I'm just hoping lung cancer is curable by the time I'm dying of it. I can't wait to get my new lungs grown from my own stem cells on a scaffold. ;)""Here is what I did, I got a big ass jar and threw the money for a pack of smokes in there whenever I would normally buy a pack... I just let this save up and I quite cold turkey. This jar was right next to my bed across the room so I could see every morning the money I used to smoke away and now that money is sitting in the form of a big ass TV in my living room a constant reminder of what a waste smoking is."Cold turkey. Smoked for 10 years and haven't had one cigarette in almost 9 months."I wasn't smoking for very long, maybe half a year at most. One day I kept feeling nauseated after each puff. I gave up half way through and decided to quit. Took me my third try to be successful.
""Cold turkey! I said ""this is it"" and gave it up. No smoking less and diminishing the amount until you only have one a day. Just quit. Mentally reward yourself for every hour you're able to make it, then every half day, then every day. Keep giving yourself a pat on the back and constantly remind yourself how much better you will feel. The hardest part is wanting to give in. Just think how far you've come and what a waste it will be to give that up. The first day is the hardest and gets easier as you go. Chew sugarfree gum. After about a week you'll notice you can breathe a bit better and your head feels clearer. Another thing that helped me was the support of my family and knowing how upset my kids were at the thought of me going back.

Good luck to anyone that tries. Don't give up on yourself. Force yourself to do it and don't let anything get in the way of quiting. 

End rant.""Pneumonia. I got it really bad last February and couldn't get out of bed. My apartments are completely non-smoking anywhere on the grounds so between the sickness, the rules, and the snow outside, I didn't smoke for about a week. When I felt better, I just never started up again and have been smoke free ever since.

Also, shout out to my people at /r/stopsmoking.""Put a patch on, have a cup of coffee when it starts to tingle/itch. It's a great buzz. Almost like having a drink. Wears off in about 15 minutes, but kept me going.

I tried gum, ecigs, tapering off, cold turkey, etc. this was the only thing that worked.""I smoked a little more than a pack a day, from a habit that spanned the better part of ten years. The last time I had a cigarette was on January 4th, 2012. I've saved $4125.65 by not smoking. Haven't missed it one bit, I can still hang out around my friends who smoke like chimneys and it doesn't bother me. 

What worked for me was nicotine gum. I'd been sick with a really bad recurring case of bronchitis (go figure), it was cold as balls outside, and simply by not being able to breathe, I'd only had about 4 a day for the first few days of January. I eventually said ""fuck this!"", went and got nicotine gum, and haven't looked back since. The combination of dedication, and a crutch to help me withdraw from the nicotine dependance was probably the winning combo.

My lung capacity has improved dramatically, along with the improvement in taste and smell. The vivid dreams of smoking, then waking up feeling guilty still linger, but not nearly as often as they did initially. It is totally worth quitting if you are serious about not wanting it anymore. "The look on my co-workers faces when I went outside to smoke.Could I also add to the question? How have you successfully stopped chewing tobacco?I was fairly determined about quitting and humble enough to admit that there's no middle ground (rare cigars or occasional party smoking) for me. I switched my addiction from smoking to the nicotine gum. I used it the same way in same places and went for cig breaks with coworkers and all that. After few years of that stopped that too at point there was no way in hell I'd ever smoke again. I still miss the nicotine gum though. Tl;dr after 15 years of everyday smoking nicotine gum worked well."I knew an Englishman in his 70's, had been smoking most of his life. He quit cold turkey. I realized if he could do it, I could too.  ""My pops used a variety of dried fruits as a way to curb the oral habit (after smoking 2 packs a day). I think that's a pretty good way to go about it since you'll obviously still want that 'release' (taking a break) so finding something to replace it (some people just suck on a straw, but that looks a bit odd) can help weaning off.""Weaning off a pack a day habit now for a month and a half, cold turkey. Recently read that drinking black tea helps with curbing the nicotine craving. So, I've been delving into tea as my new habit. It takes as much time to properly prepare a black tea as it would to smoke a whole cigarette, so it's soothing the craving and replacing the ""ritual"" aspect of smoking with steeping the tea. It's really helped out, because it tackles not only the physical addiction but the mental reliance on it. ""Cold Turkey.

It was in tandem with pulling wisdom teeth.""Can't speak for myself, but for my Dad who quit way before I entered the picture. He said to do it he bought a carton (or maybe a few packs, can't remember the details) of the grosses unfiltered cigs he could find and then chain smoked them till he was nauseous. After that it was -easy- to go cold turkey.""**FEAR**



* I don't want to talk about it but you can imagine why I stopped cold turkey one day after 20+ years. Previous attempts- nic gum, nic patches, nic lozenge, chantix""You have to want to stop. If its done by someone else suggesting it, it probably won't stick. I decided that there's no real reason to smoke. Still smoke 'erb without tobacco but I looked at it like "" this cigarette dosen't get me high. Fuck it these are boke!"" The first day in which you would normally be smoking a lot (work, studies etc) is fucking murder! For myself after the first day all thoughts of smoking were gone. Twas like the first hurdle if you like. Now I just have to stick to it.""Honestly for me it was will power and being ready, oh and lots of coffee and tea.  I simply was ready mentally and quit after 20 years of smoking a pack a day.  I drank an excessive amount of tea and coffee though.""Cold turkey here..  Finally I became disgusted with the habit and got it in my mind to quit.  The first week was the worst, and then I just figured if I started again why did I waste that week or two weeks etc.. Today I cannot stand the smell of smoke and smokers 

Before I finally quit for good, I quit buying several times.."It was a slow thing of thinking about the pros and cons over a couple of years. Was at work and realized I hated the taste so much I gagged while smoking. On the way home picked up some patches and used them for two weeks after almost 10 year at a pack and a half a day. The funny thing was that the smell of cigarette smoke after that became nauseating and really helped me keep from going back. Even five years later I can't stand the smell bow and it is the largest turn off for me now. Scarlett johansen could be about to go down on me but if I see her or smell smoke on her Id lose all attraction to her and go flaccid immediately."I am on day 60. I was a pack a day smoker for ten years. The vaporizer really helped with my cravings. Buying a vaporizor is the only thing I did differently, I am also not addicted to the vape, I bring it with me in social settings because I know there will always bee a slight craving for cigs, but this satisfies the crave. 

 The thing that got me to resent cigs the most was imagining my Fiance or my parents watch me die from some stupid disease that I could have prevented by quitting smoking. Watching the ""truth"" commercials, and seriosly imaginging one of those people being me in 20 years was just unfathomable.   

I came to realize that I am better than cigarettes, and THIS SUBREDDIT really showed me how evil cigarettes are, and that there are 20,000 others right here with me.

 I know this sounds cliche' but if I can do it, anyone can!"My mom bet me 500 bucks I couldn't quit.Wanting to quit more than wanting to smoke."My method is a controversial one; I used an e-cig.  I used it for 3 months, progressively tapering my nicotine level down to zero, at which point I stopped using it.  It's not typically recommended as a quit method, because it basically prolongs the withdrawals, and people end up not tapering off, but I was able to muster up the will power to make it work.  I'm still not completely out of the woods, but I haven't smoked in 6 months, and cravings are pretty rare at this point.

Also, I took the first 3 days off work to get through the initial withdrawals.  If you have to do this, it's absolutely worth it.""Do NOT take the first one again. 1 is too much, 1000 is not enough. Addiction."Low dose Bupropion (generic Wellbutrin) and the patch. Chantix is overpriced garbage. The Wellbutrin helps you to be less of a dick once you've quit and helps with the cravings. "I was stressing out about not having money ever. Pay $60 towards credit card, use that $60 towards cigarettes. Then one day after the price of a pack went up again I was driving home from work and decided I was gonna quit. Got home, ran my last 5 cigarettes under the faucet and went on the patch.

The patch messed me up. I was having crazy dreams but it ended up working. Now I only smoke when I'm with my friends. Some say I didn't really quit, but when I can see that $80+ in my bank account because I stopped smoking on a daily basis, I feel like I quit.""I quit three times in total. The first time was cold turkey and I stayed clean for a year. The second time was champix and I quit within a week for 6 months until life happened, then the last time which was successful, I quit using champix again. I've been clean for nearly three years now""I never wanted to quit. I miss the 5 minutes to myself or the comraderie of a break between classmates. I was broke and cigarette in Seattle were $8. It was eat or smoke. There was a time when I ate a cup of rice a day. Unemployment really blows. I smoked Marlboro Red and weened myself off. That was 5 years ago. I'm good now. Sometimes I'll have a cigarette or two if I'm out drinking with other smokers, but I definitely feel (and smell) like shit the next day. My parents quit with medicine, again slowly weening themselves off. I truly believe it takes 21 days to kick (or start) any habit. I stopped drinking soda and biting my nails that way. Good luck. ""one day my lungs started to hurt. I mean they really hurt. Breathing hurt. Then as time went on i realized that the poison in the smoke does to my body. I saw how it wrinkles your face, makes your body turn green in color. your eyes sink into your skull. The smell. The awful smell.""First of all I always felt guilty about smoking because my parents quit. I tried cold turkey but failed hard. I then started chewing nicorette and stayed on the largest dose (4mg I think) for a year. This tranferred the addiction to chewing instead of puffing. I still chew 3 pieces of gum a day, but my lungs feel 10 times better.""Ecig. You said you already had one and its not working for you, but what do you have? The blue type cigalikes or an ego type kit? You have to approach ecigs as if you are quitting analogs cold turkey, its just much easier as you keep the oral habit and the nicotine but in auch safer medium. Head over to r/electronic_cigarette and browse around. If you invest a little more $$ you will get a much more satisfying experience. "Cold turkey!Ziban did the trick for me."Kurt Vonnegut jr described smoking as ""a socially acceptable way of committing suicide."" This, together with various statistics about smoking (not so much death rates as data about *who* predominantly smokes - prisoners, mental health patients etc) led me to the revelation that I wasn't smoking because I enjoyed it, or because I wanted to, but because I hated myself and needed to. It's like any form of self-harm. You need to stop fooling yourself about your motives before you do anything else.

Once I came to this realisation, I gave up cold turkey. Each time, I destroyed the cigarettes I had last thing at night, meaning the next morning the only way I could smoke was to buy more. It took me 4 or 5 attempts, but I haven't now smoked for over 10 years.""I quit cold turkey, 15 years ago.

I kept a pack next to my bed, and personalized it - if I dug into that pack for a smoke, Tobacco would have won.

It was difficult for about a month, and after that the cravings came less regularly.

At this point I can smoke the odd cigar (maybe once a year) and still not have a craving for cigarettes.

And I can run half marathons, do triathlons, bicycle races and open water swimming races without wanting to die :-)""1) Cold turkey, 
2) Convince yourself not to buy smokes, Make it a financial decision. I can say ""I don't wanna spend 5 bucks,"" but i cant say ""i don't want a cig."" 
3) the most difficult, don't drink. At least if you don't want to smoke. 

""When trying to ween yourself off, DO NOT smoke during trigger situations. My triggers were: 
1. Driving 
2. After eating 
3. After/during drinking 
4. After sex 
5. After smoking cannabis

This really helps to break the habitual addiction and makes smoking less convenient and more uncomfortable. Also keeping track of how much money I saved helped. $580.89 in the past 77 days!""When I quit I was up to about 2 packs a day. I quit cold turkey. It took several tries, but after the third attempt I quit for good and its been about 9 years.""I found that having a goal really helped. I had a huge hike planned in a few months so every time I wanted one I'd just think about how much more I would struggled if I didn't let my lungs recover. 

That being said I started smoking again a few weeks after the hike...Trying the ecig thing now and planning a new adventure so, I dunno, fingers crossed?""Here is what worked for me. 

I quit cold turkey. About three weeks later I ended up throwing a party for my bday. Had a great time and got very drunk. At the end of the night, I was offered a cig. I thought ""it's my bday, why not"". I got about halfway through the cig and it was pretty gross. Then I got the spins, threw up. That was the last cig I ever had :)

tl;dr Quit cold turkey, couple weeks later got drunk, smoked, puked...quitting successful.

""20 years ago I decided that if I kept smoking I had about 4 more years to live. I was tired of the stench of my clothes and my furniture. I was tired of being ostracized by my peers. I envisioned my lungs with years of built up tar. I'd quit a hundred times. Finally decided I wanted to live rather than slowly commit suicide. After the first two weeks it got easier and I found myself less disgusted by myself.
It helps to quit habits that precede smoking...unfortunately this often includes drinking. chances are if you are a heavy smoker you're also a drunk.""In all honesty - knowing that I was ready. 

I smoked for 10 years. Heavily. Tried to quit around the 4 year mark but really liked smoking still. 

About 3 & a half years ago I realised I no longer enjoyed smoking. 

Smoked my last cigarette at a friends birthday party. Woke up the next morning & never touched another cigarette. Cold turkey. Even bought an emergency packet which I gave away, unopened, 3 days later.

Sure, I still get cravings - but when you can smell what smokers smell like,  you won't want to pick another one up. Ever. Again. ""My doctor needed to screen me for lung cancer after being sick for a long time. I was in my early 20's and learned the reality of the damage smoking causes very quickly. I decided to quit immediately after thinking how me having cancer and dying would affect my wife. Luckily, no cancer.""I've mentioned this before on reddit, but get yourself put in a coma. My dad was in one for about a month after a heart surgery, and when he woke up, he never wanted one again. He's been a pack a day smoker for something like 25 years. According to the doctors he basically went through withdrawal while unconscious. 

So yeah. Get a friend and a hunk of concrete. There's no way it could end badly. "Cold turkey is the only way to do it. Just stop buying them and smoking them. After the first and worst 72 hours its easy street"I actually just stopped smoking 6 months and 25 days ago, when I moved from California to Canada. Long story short, in California, I was around alot of negative shit, going from the people who I hung out with (Who most were felons and stuff reputable people) and did alot of drugs. The few good people I hung out with, would always ask me to do things for them (Everything from moving furniture to paying for entire trips for us to travel up and down the state, at the time I truely did think they were my true friends)

I quit smoking 100 different times, for a week sometimes to an entire year. What finally did it for me, was when I started realizing how much money I was spending on cigarettes, realizing very quickly that it was why I couldn't move out of my mom's house, it was why I couldn't get a car and everything else. From there (I smoked pot for the first time) and cigarettes never tasted the same afterwards, they actually tasted like absolute shit.

Apon moving to Canada with girlfriend (Who is now my wife), she told me I wasn't allowed to smoke anymore. We now live with her parents (Who both smoke) but I don't get the urge to smoke anymore. Mainly what did it for me, was when I smoked pot, I realized how much money I was wasting and truely how much damage cigarettes were doing. I also started realizing, I was paying about 2000 dollars a year for what? Somthing to shorten my life. I also realized that I was in a very negative environment and I needed to get out of that.


TLDR: Smoked pot for the first time, it made me start thinking about how much money I was paying a year for a product that was just ultimately killing me. In other words, I was paying for someone to kill me, which seemed counter productive.""Hello reddit.

Just wanted to share my situation with you.  I still love cigs.  Fucking love'em. And I've been clean for about 4 years.  At my peak, I smoked about 2 packs a day.  How did I quit? My gf promised me bjs, and lots of sex... and it worked.  While it's easy to hide from a non-smoker that you're still smoking (febreeze/shower/listerine), one thing you can't hide is the smell of cigs that oozes from your lungs in the mornings. Trust me, they can tell if you're still smoking or not! 

My gf's dad is a heavy smoker, and she's always hated guys that smoke.  I had promised to quit Jan 1st, and it really took me until Jan 15th or so to truly go cold turkey.  Was I cranky all the time? Yes.  Did I struggle?  God yes.  The hardest day was the first time I drank heavily at a birthday party.  That night, I picked up a cigarette, looked at it, and just shrugged... gave it back.  And that night, I had more sex.

After 30 days, it was steak and BJ Day.  60 days?  steak and BJ Day.  100 days?  She let me finish inside her for the first time in our relationship.  (Besttttt feeling.... everrrrr) O_O

We're not together anymore, but damn, I am so thankful of those days, and thankful that she helped me quit.  Thank you Jina, for saving my lungs, my life, one hump at a time...""My insurance broker told me he can reduce my premium by almost $100 a month if I tested clean for nicotine and it takes about 8 weeks to be able to do that (allegedly). So I knew I couldn't slip up and have that ONE cigarette. I planned on going back to smoking after, but once all was said and done, I was smoke free for around 3 months, so I didn't want to undo all that work.""Cold turkey. I smoked for 5 years, and one day while playing basketball I felt like I was having a heart attack. It shook me. I went home, broke the rest of my pack in half and threw them in the trash. The first month sucked and the rest of the year was filled with cravings and trying to bargain with myself to pick up a pack for old times sake. Stay strong. If you truly want to quit, you will. ""Have a child.  Once they're 5 years old, have them tell you sincerely to stop smoking because they don't want you to die.  Stop smoking cold turkey the next day.

Every time I lit up, I told myself hey you've only got ___ till this isn't happening anymore. I didn't taper off, I didn't do patches, gum, or any of that. Then, on the date, i just woke up, kept myself busy all day and then... that was it. 
I just kept reminding myself that, a craving only lasts 8 seconds. Its pretty much like riding a bull. Just hang on for 8 seconds. Don't try to kid yourself that you're not on a bull. Embrace the craving. Swim around in it. It SUCKS! But, just don't kid yourself. It's either these cravings or going back to smoking. 
I've gone 14 months and haven't touched a smoke. Not a puff. I barely even think about them anymore. 
Good luck!
EDIT: I smoked for 16 years. Pack a day. ""I quit years ago, when I was 22. Lots and lots of chupachups lollys and I decided to take a break from going to bars for a few months""Electronic cigarette!!! Havent had a smoke in three years, cuz of my ecig. Now even the thought of smoking is disgusting, anytime I smell someone smoking, I in no way want to join them. E-cigs are a good way to go.""Snus. It gives a bit of that roast flavor. You can pop them in your mouth at any time, and no one would know. Plus, it gives a strong dose of nicotine.

While I'm still addicted to nicotine, the delivery method is so much safer. I read a study done in Australia that switching from smoking to Snus had the same health benefits as cold turkey.

Also, starting an exercise program helps a ton. It provides that bump in adrenaline and dope, but also stress relief at the same time (akin to cigs)"" I know you said you had an electronic cigarette, but do you have an efficient one that produces enough smoke? If you arent satisfied with the quality of vapor your ecig produces its hard to want to use it as a substitute.

So about your quitting question.. Well...death stopped my dad. Not the threat of it, he just actually died. If impending lung cancer doesn't do it for ya I don't know what will.

They say it's more difficult to quit than heroin. Availability and addictive properties & all that.

My advice as a smoker survivor, REPLACE YOUR ADDICTION. I know that probably seems like bad advice or something but trust me, you need something to wean with. Cold turkey just does not work for everybody. 

Some people use bud, some use sweets, some use just a fake cigarette rolled from paper. Now they even have ecigs.

Replace it with something you enjoy, that mentally soothes you. What you have to accept is that the drug has become your crutch and without it, you are going to feel uncomfortable for a time. 
It's like if you stopped wearing pants for years then suddenly had to go back to the straight and narrow of wearing pants at all times. It's not comfortable, not desirable, not fun. But wearing pants is a good idea for your well being and we have concrete evidence to support that.

It will take time & you'll always know what it felt like to ditch pants for so long, you'll crave ditching your pants, maybe once, twice, more etc. but you must always put the pants back on. For you see, you can always put the pants back on if you slip and take them off. But you have to have the will to say, I will put on my pants today, even if I take them off again later, putting them on now is good for my health. 

See what I'm saying? If you slip up and smoke again, you can still keep quitting. Failure is the necessary first step to success.

As far as replacing the habit, I recommend a food you love, some kind of sensory reward. Maybe a soft drink you never allow yourself. Perhaps a specialty item of produce. Maybe a video game that you left behind due to adult life but you still immensely enjoy. 
Heck, adopting a pet will occupy your time, attention and give you a psychological reward everytime you pet or play with them. Plus you're saving somebody.

Also, I think it's important to note, at the end of all this you actually can take off your pants and relax guilt free. Maybe enjoy some beef jerky with your pup or cat. And without constricting pants! Your freedom is calling you! Just some stuff to consider.""Temperature played a big role.  Back in January of 2009, there was a span of about a week where it was single digits.  Just too cold.  So a day went by, then another day, then another day.  Each day was easier than the previous.  Took 5 or 6 days before my wife even noticed.

I smoked for 15 years.  She had been pestering me to quit for 4 years.  I wanted to quit.  But those reason weren't always enough.  Took everything.   

My Dr. told me, ""You did the single best thing you could have done for your health, but the single worst thing you could have done for your weight.""   ""It's been 9 and a half months since I quit. I had tried gum and weening myself off slowly, but it never worked. 
I had recently moved from a city where 90% of my friends and people at parties and bars smoked to a city where almost no one does. I became that gross girl who stank like cigarettes all the time, and I didn't like it. They guy I was talking to, who's now my boyfriend, didn't like it, even though he said he didn't care. I finally got fed up with being a burden by asking my friends to wait while I smoked or being looked down upon by people who didn't smoke. Also, I have so many fancy perfumes, and it seemed like a shame to use them when I knew I would stink later anyway. 
I got an app that tracks how long it's been since you quit, the health benefits you have reached and the money you saved. I basically went cold turkey because I decided I was finally done."A shrooms trip made me realize how shitty it is. Plain and simple. So I guess cold turkey.Getting pregnant "Cold turkey. You just have to make a decision, pick a date, and refuse to fail. Worked for me and everyone else I know who succeeded. I've never seen anything else work. ""Weed.

It helped me to realize how bad tabacco is and it made going cold turkey a lot easier.""way lat to this...  But you just have to stop..  Pick a date to quit. Smoke and enjoy your last one.  Then just stop..  Also figure out what your triggers are.  For me it was drinking, so i layed off drinking for two weeks.  Then when i started again i switched what i was drinking.  If i was a beer drinking, i drank wine now.  Or i had a vodka or scotch..  You need to want to quit though.  Thats the most important part.""Not mine, but a family member's.

The doctor told him that each and every single cigarette in the world had enough nicotine in it to trigger an angina attack and kill him. He went from a 5 pack a day smoker to never smoking again that day.""I went through five different models of electronic cigarettes until I found one that satisfied my craving sufficiently to let me stop. And once I found the right brand, I stopped real cigarettes in two days flat.

I'm not affiliated with any company - but in case you want to try it out, the e-juice from vapornine.com (I use crisp menthol for the throat-hit), and a cigarette from the SoCal chain VaporSpot (model iTazte VV) is what I use.""Smoker of ten years here. I was always fortunate to be able to cold turkey when I wanted to. I was never a pack-a-day, mostly just a pack every 4 days.

What I did was I finally stopped and realized what I was doing to my body, tasted my last cigarette and came to the conclusion that it was a pointless habit. To help the cravings I bought a huge bag of Fire Jolly Ranchers and kept those in my pocket for when I had the urge. It surprisingly helped a great deal.

TL;DR cold turkey, fire jolly ranchers.""Buproprion/zyban, the original smoking cessation drug.  I think chantix only game on the market because zyban has been a generic forever now, but it absolutely works. 


My doc gave ms zyban and said ""go ahead and keep smoking, we'll talk about how that's  going in a month"". 

I believe it works by blocking the nicotine receptors in your brain, meaning not only do you not get a nicotine buzz, but the WDs caused by open receptors aren't nearly as bad. For me it was mostly the addiction I had to fight, the chemical addiction was totally blocked by the zyban. By week 2 cigarettes stop tasting good or giving a nic rush.  By week three they were downright awful. Even when you don't think you're getting a nicotine hit, you are, it subconsciously effects you're taste of the cigarette, because sans nic, it's totally disgusting. 


Tldr; ask doc for zyban/bupropion.  It's also used as a mild antidepressant, btw. Pretty low side effect profile too, other than totally blocking nicotine.  "Don't forget to curse Sir Walter Raleigh....stupid git. Set a wristwatch and one cigarette on a table next to each other. Nothing else. Stare at both. You may only put the cigarette in your mouth OR the watch on your wrist. Choose ONE. Don't leave the table until you've made a decision."I quit by using ecigs and reducing my nic content over time. used o$ juice for 2 months, and realized i don't need it any more. ""I bought a nice e-cigarette as a hobby, for the novelty of smoking indoors whenever I wanted, and enjoyed it so much that I stopped craving cigarettes and practically quit without trying. So I decided to commit and never looked back. It's true that e-cigs aren't for everybody, but if it works for you like it did for me, it's totally worth it.
/r/electronic_cigarette""I did cold turkey. Admittedly this is not the first time. You just gotta make up your mind, quit and then give yourself no excuses and no options. After being arrested by the police and taken against my will to a non smoking jail where cigarettes are treated as a criminal offense like drugs, made me realize that I really can quit. Once you recognize your rationalization and excuses for what they are and realize that quitting is the slow walk of changing a learned human behavior you will stop wasting your time with quitting strategies and go about quitting by actually quitting before you start the internal conversation about the details and daily realities you'll face."The love of a good woman "A guy, who later became my husband.  We've been married over 16 years, and I've been cigarette free for over 17.  :)""Personally, I quit smoking 3 or 4 times as well. I've read that relapsing makes quitting harder. Keep that in mind, but don't let it deter you. The best way to quit (without medication/doctor's visit), IS cold turkey as the top comment mentions. But adding to that, it helps to change vices along-side cold turkey. When you get a trigger, chew a toothpick, chew gum, drink a soda, eat candy or sunflower seeds. Anything that involves your mouth. A lot of the romance in smoking cigarettes comes from our oral fixation. Sounds inappropriate, but true.

If you're desperate to quit **smoking**, you can also switch to a different form of tobacco. Chewing/spitting tobacco is arguably the lesser of the two evils and could be considered the methadone of nicotine. It's easy to dismiss the idea because they're both terrible for you. Personally, at my worst, I could smoke 2 or 3 packs a day, but averaged 1 pack per day. At my worst with smokeless tobacco, I'd use 2 cans per week and on average, 1 can a week. If you've never done it before, use an unflavored tobacco and what ever is cheapest. It's disgusting and essentially tastes like dirt.

Whatever you decide, be sure to figure out how to quit your vice and good luck!""I just stopped thinking about it
I tried helping pieces like e-cigarette and pills but they never helped.
One day I said to myself: 'After this pack of smokes I quit' and then I just did. 
That's really all there is too it, you come to a point where you actually do WANT to quit, and only then will you be able to, if a small part of you doesn't want to quit (don't mistake this for not enjoying cigarettes anymore, I still would love to smoke one but I don't want to smoke one if you understand what I mean) then you wont make it""Some cunt that I worked with at a bar told me and the kitchen crew we all had absolutely no self-control, and she bet us we couldn't quit. No money or reward, just the satisfaction of the bitch eating her words. To me, that was enough satisfaction. I quit the next day and have been cigarette free for about 12 years.

So, I also believe cold turkey works, but the key is YOU have to want to quit first and foremost, as your will is going to be tested.""Ecigs, baby. ""I smoked from 18-26. Started off as a social smoker and before long I was a pack a day all the way through college. When I was 26 my grandfather, who was 72, was diagnosed with lung cancer. He smoked since 17 too. I was in the hospice room with my grandmother when he took his last breath. I walked outside and smoked my last cigarette. I decided I wasn't going out like that. I'm 34 now. ""The absolute most important thing to keep in mind is that eventually the cravings will go away and it won't matter that you don't smoke.  First week was always pretty easy, but by the second week into it I'd be thinking ""this sucks, I can't live the rest of my life like this, fuck it"" and would buy a pack and be back to square one.  At some point you'll stop being a person who is quitting smoking, and just be a person who doesn't smoke.  I promise it gets easier, and once you realize that you're actually working towards a goal rather than just making yourself miserable for the rest of your life it gets exponentially easier to quit.""I've tried everything short of prescription drugs. The gum, the patch, cold turkey. I find that everyone has their own thing that gets them to quit. For me none of those things worked. The urge to continue smoking was too great. I might make it 3 months without a smoke, then BAM I'm right back at it. Finally I go an electronic cigarette.  It gave me what I needed. I was able to ween myself off of nicotine while still enjoying the act of smoking (minus the harmful parts). I still vape today, but the juice I use contains no nicotine. I get to enjoy my bad habit without the bad.""Cold Turkey doesn't work for me.

Only thing that works is a mixture of all the gimmicks (gum. E-cigs) AND THE SUPPORT OF YOUR COLLEAGUES/FRIENDS. Sorry for shouting, but this cannot be stressed enough. It makes all the difference in the world when someone keeps you from going outside and having that cig (because 15 minutes later, it will be ""ok"", even if chewing that stupid gum is fucking shit compared to lighting up).

Oh, and don't take any shit from non smokers. They just don't get it. As my Dr. said to me once: ""Look, rockenrohl, There's several hundred wonderful chemicals in your cigarette, and they make your brain's sinapses light up like a firework. It's not just the nicotine, you know that. It's an amazing thing, smoking... the problem is: IT HURTS YOUR LUNGS. The stupid pharma industry should investigate what's happening in a smoker's brain and come up with a safe device that does the same thing. They should have done that for *decades*, goddammit. But as these idiots *haven't*, it is my job as your doctor to tell you to quit as quickly as possible. Because you are killing yourself.""

Yes, I love my doctor. Have been off the cigs for seven months now. Still difficult when there's coffee. Still difficult when there's beer. Oh, and most difficult when there's typical triggers (some extra stuff to think about at work... I know how you feel, man). But hang in there, it can be done. Just talk to everyone there, people *will* support you. You just have to let them. You have to *want* this.""I picked a date with meaning, told everyone about it and smoked with abandon up until that point. For me, it was the day I graduated college. I made such a big deal about both everyone externally and internalized it myself that a failure to live up to the promise really would have changed how I thought about myself as a person. Date came, still remember staying up late chain smoking.  3 days on the gum. I've never had another drag - that was 15 years ago.  Also remember thinking - statistically, you become more likely to stay a non-smoker than to revert at six months.  So that was my intermediate goal.  After that I relaxed and felt like I'd made it. Also interesting to me - I still feel like if I had one cigarette right now I'd go back to smoking. I loved that shit. ""Be 100% committed. 

I was 28, and a 1-2 pack a day smoker. I got a cold, a really really bad one. I usually smoked through sickness, 'cause the addiction told me it makes me feel better. But this one was bad. 3 days of no smoking with the cold, I decided what the heck I'll see how long I can go - I was not at all planning on quitting. 7 days of no smoking and I was in the hospital emergency room. 

It was 3am, and I jolted awake out of a deep sleep thinking my heart had stopped. I thought for sure, this is it, I'm a gonner. My girlfriend rushed me to the ER, and I was perplexed how I was even walking since my heart felt like it was non-existent. I could not sense a heartbeat in my own chest! Why was this happening????

ER doc laid me on the table, and I was curled into a tense, tight ball. I had no idea what was going on. Doc says to me ""Do you smoke cigarettes or do cocaine?"". What a strange and precise question, I thought. I said no, never had cocaine, but that I had not had a cigarette in 7 days. He says ""You are going through withdrawal. You have a few options, start smoking again or fight it out.""

I was dumbfounded. Cigarette withdrawal??? He gave me a Xanax and I slept like a baby. 

This experience scared me out of smoking ever again, and made me feel vulnerable to addiction for the first time in my life. I went through diagnosis of panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and all sorts of stuff afterwards. I had to reconcile lots of issues in my life, issues and stresses I often buried in the comfort of my cigarette addiction. It has been 6 years since I quit and I want a cigarette all the time - but its OK. I love tobacco. I love the taste, the smell, the way it feels inhaling and exhaling. I love the way it changes food and drink experiences. I allow myself to be OK with loving it all, but no longer partaking in it. I go out on smoke breaks with friends, and just enjoy the smells and the comradery. I want it, I want it bad, but I just don't need it after-all. 

Full disclosure - I do have a cigar once in a blue moon. For me, there is a psychological disconnect with cigars though - I can have one and be done for months on end. I know if I had 1 cigarette, I'd be a chimney in no time. I could also go without a cigar for the rest of my life and would not think twice about it if I had to. 

It's a personal journey. In my mind, cigarette smoking is no longer an option. There is no doubt about it for me. You have to get to that point, too, and unfortunately it is one of the most difficult and personal journeys to take. 

I will say, however, its never easy but it certainly gets easier over time. The first several weeks are the worst - especially if you are not 100% committed to it. But, if you are 100% committed, strangely, in time you just stop thinking about it. You simply stop those seemingly-autonomous reaches for the cigarette pack. As more time passes, you just feel proud of yourself. It's great.

So, in answer to your question, ""what actually worked for you?"" Being 100% committed, whatever route you take. Personally, I see E-Cigarettes as a stop-gap, allowing your brain to still identify yourself as a smoker. You have to identify yourself as a non-smoker - 100%. That is not to say you have to ""hate"" cigarettes (I LOVE them) or deny the cravings due to the addiction, but you can't allow yourself to smoke them anymore. Many people can quit cold-turkey and experienced none of the issues I did, and I wish this was true for everyone. Even still, quitting smoking was the best decision I ever made in my life. Not only for the physical health benefits, but for the mental health benefits. It forced me to create time to work on my life stressors, to listen to doctors, to care about my physical and mental health in a way I never thought about before. Cigarettes were no longer my reward system. There is no right and wrong way, this experience was as unique to me as it will be for you. Good luck, I hope you succeed in the long run!""If anyone has any advice on how to get past the cravings that hit you after a couple drinks, I'd love to hear it-- that has been my undoing every time. (And I really don't wanna have to quit both...) "Slowly weaning myself down over the course of about eight months. Smoking being banned in bars helped as well."I got married. It was enough of a shock to the system that quitting smoking seemed easy. Rough honeymoon though. 

I had quit several time before that. Keep trying. I haven't smoked since 1980. Gum, pills, e-cigs, and all that only prolong the agony."Will power. I woke up on Tuesday morning and decided I was not smoking anymore. Not smoked for over 2 years now."We found out christmas of 2012 that my grandfather had stage 4 lung cancer in both lungs. We was a heavy smoker for about 50 years but quit about 4 or 5 years before his death thanks to chantex. I was a 2 pack a dayer for about two years, so when my family heard the news they asked me to quit cigs. I quit cold turkey after i made em a promise that i wouldn't touch another cig . I occasionally smoke my pipe or a cigar, but i haven't even done either of those since my birthday this past November. It's ultimately about will power. You decide you will not smoke anymore no matter what. If you get the jitters then try taking a quick 10-20 min nap if u r able, chew gum, fidget with things, etc. when i got a new car a month after quitting i got manual transmission so my hands would be occupied, as i smoked every time i was in my car. when you get headaches coffee helps. While i would not recommend this as a method of kicking nicotine, dipping gives you the fix without the chances of lung cancer. I found it less habit forming (dipped for periods when i was a smoker) than cigarettes. Understand that it has it's risks as well, although i see them as less likely than cigarette's risks as it doesn't contain the chemicals that cigs do. Set milestones and goals for yourself. This past dec 23 i hit one year cigarette free (didn't have a cgi for a few days prior to finding out about my grandpa). Remind yourself each month that it has been another month. Tell your friends and family about your progress so that they can encourage you.""I only allowed my self to smoke at one place, a friends house. After a while it was the only place I wanted to smoke. Then I told them to punch me if I smoked.""I've been cigarette free for almost 3 years now but prior to that, I was a pack and a half a day smoker. 

What made me really want to quit was when I went on a hike with some friends of mine and on the way back up, I was getting so winded that we had to take several breaks so I could catch my breath. I felt so embarrassed that I was a liability.

I tried the patch several times, and the longest I lasted on those was about 4 months. While on the patch, I was avoiding potential triggers such as drinking of being around smokers. At the 4 month mark, I had 1 too many drinks and i ended up smoking again.

What I realized then was that I shouldn't avoid doing things that I used to associate smoking with(i.e. Drinking, eating, studying, taking a dump, etc) but rather, learn to do them without having a smoke. Also, I started working out the same day that I quit cold turkey, and I began to count each day as an achievement. A day became a week, then a month, then a year and so on. 

Hope that helps man, good luck!""Snus. Snus, snus, snus snus.""1) Actually wanting to quit. This I think is the most important one, because without real motivation you will cheat constantly.

2) Hanging out with people who don't smoke. Less opportunities and you'll just smoke less, this is a good way to start. 

3) Consciously breaking physical habits. Smoking I think is mostly about habit, even after you shake the actual NICOTINE craving you have to shake the physical habits. For me it was the car, I would always smoke in the car. So I stopped keeping cigarettes IN the car. Things like that helped a lot, just making them less available to myself helped stave off moments of weakness.

4) Just doing it eventually. Its easier to go cold turkey if you've taken those other steps to like, break some of the not-smoking-related smoking habits. Once you no longer feel like you HAVE to have one after your morning coffee and you're no longer part of the work smoke break club, then when you go cold turkey its actually about just quitting smoking instead of changing your whole life. ""Icy pops, that ones you put in your freezer.  And lately Blow pops.  Every time I wanted a cigarette, I had a sugary and orally fixated treat.  That is for the physical part.  

For the mental part, I started doing more cardio based exercises, and could noticable tell smoking had an impact on my lungs and performance.  So I would know I am working out on friday, so I wouldnt smoke thursday leading up to friday to increase my performance.

And not buying any packs.  I would bum them from random people, but never actually buy a pack.

Those things combined, I formed captain planet.   "Working out and eating healthier. The lifestyle change caused it to spill over into other bad habits so I just stopped smoking."Take a pack of cigarettes, get the pack soaking wet. Start yelling how these things are gross. Start putting the wet cigs in your mouth. Feel how gross they are. You might throw up. This is a way to essentially scar yourself from liking cigarettes. Laugh all you want it worked for me. ""To much time playing WoW, didn't have time to smoke. ""I quit cold turkey. My father had a massive heart attack when he was only 42. He was very thin, athletic, and cholesterol of only 202 at the time. His only risk factor was smoking a pack a day Marlboro man. In fact, everyone in his family who smoked either died from sudden heart attacks or strokes. I put 2 and 2 together as I walked into the ER to see him near death, took his smokes, took mine, threw them in the ER trash and neither of us smoked again. I was 21 at the time and was a pack a day Marlboro man too, for about 5 years.

My father ended up needing a heart transplant 5 months later. This was back in 1988, he's still with us today doing very well. Went back to work, hasn't missed a day of work in 26 years since it happened. He never returned to smoking. His latest scans show the arteries on his new heart to be completely open and functioning perfectly. His donated heart is now 48 years old, he'll be 69 in April. The donor was 24 at the time of his death.

Thank you donor family, I think of you often.

Don't smoke. If you manage to avoid cancer and cardio diseases, you will drown in your own fluids. Also, my father's MI was on the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, A.K.A. ""the widow maker""""My mother has COPD already from smoking, and then came down with pneumonia. I was already considering quitting, but seeing her so sick from something preventable was terrifying... especially when I realized I started smoking at the same age she did. It was like seeing my future. After that realization, I became physically ill every time I lit a cigarette until I decided to throw away my pack. I used the electronic cigarette to keep down the horrible effects of withdrawal, and weened myself slowly off of those. I only allowed myself to use the electronic cigarette for a week, and each day I decreased the amount I used it. I've been smoke free for a month so far and have absolutely no desire to ever start back. When I get stressed, I get a sucker and use that instead. ""Have a different break habit, like squats. Also, create a magical token that reminds you to make the right choice."I was convinced I had erectile dysfunction cause of smokingI went out on Mardi Gras night and got drunk and chainsmoked two or three packs. The next day I felt truly horrible and quit cold turkey."I quit by accident... I went out and got incredibly drunk off of margaritas and tequila shots for a friends birthday.  I had just purchased 2 'buy one get one' packs of camel Lights, So i had 4 packs on me.  I woke up the next morning with half a pack left, and the worst fucking feeling ever in my entire body.  I felt like I had been poisoned.  I tried to smoke a cig and got violently ill.  I couldnt smoke for the rest of the day.   
  
The next day all I could think about was that feeling, and the rest is history.  I have tried cigarettes since then, usually while drinking, and they are just completely tainted for me, I simply do not enjoy them anymore.  ""Being lazy, I just decided I cbf walking to the shops any more, after 2 packs a day for 10 years lol.

I've quit cold turkey, used electronic cigarettes, etc but always resumed smoking.

I used bupropion for a month and half last summer and have truly quit as a result. 

**It was an awful month.** I barely slept, had crazy dreams, was unbelievably cranky, had anxiety and a foggy head. I'm not sure how much of this was nicotine withdrawal vs. the bupropion itself, but I stopped early because I couldn't take it anymore and my senses returned to normal shortly thereafter.

I've had an occasional cigar since - and even a cigarette when I was drinking - **but honestly, it's like a switch flipped - I find them as repulsive as I did before I smoked.** There is a bit of nostalgia, from time to time, but that's the closest thing to a craving I've had in 6 months.""Yoga. I dont mean taking 1 or 2 classes. I mean getting a real practice or routine going. Learning how to beeathe. It will releive stress and anxiety and will naturally transform your body to dislike things that arent good for you. Try yin. Try ashtanga.

""I feel like I got lucky - either that, or I just picked the right time. 

It was my second attempt. The first time, I tried electronic cigarettes, same as you, and I couldn't do just those for long - for some reason, I needed the real thing after a while.

The second time, I tried the patch. I had just moved into a new house, and coincidentally, had just bought a new car. So a lot of my triggers were gone. I was worried about the patch, because I'd heard a lot of people were allergic to it, and I seem to be allergic to *everything*.

Despite this, I set myself up thusly - I signed up for NY's smoke-free assistance program ahead of time - they sent me free patches, enough for the first two weeks. I worked alone at the time, doing the night audit at a hotel. So I timed smoking my last pack of cigarettes so that my very last cigarette would be two hours into my shift, forcing me to go six hours without. I don't remember my logic for this, but it seemed to make sense at the time.

After my last cigarette, I put the patch on. I expected the cravings to be terrible, but the patch worked as advertised - I had a couple of small cravings, but after the first hour, I found I didn't even really want a cigarette for the rest of my shift. I was worried about how I'd sleep, but I slept like a baby. Confidence bolstered, I changed my patch religiously.

The first month was the worst of it, a lot of my friends smoked, and every time they did, I stayed inside, alone. But one by one, they started quitting too. Now there's only one or two left, and I can freely hang around them. I still occasionally get cravings, but they're extremely rare, and they go away quickly.

And I've been smoke-free for 3 years and 27 days. ""Nicotrel.  Nothing works better.

I didn't feel like I HAD to quit, there was no real external pressure, I just finished a pack one day and didn't want anymore. My dad said the same thing.

* 1) I used to smoke Camels, then Marlboro's then Merit Ultra-Lights here in the US. I found they all had different levels of nicotine that all had different affects on my cravings. The Merits were much lighter in terms of nicotine and the attendant craving. I started to smoke them and it was much easier to 'forget' to go outside for a break.
* 2) As already noted, you have to want it and be ready for the cravings and just suck it up with mints or whatever
* 3) Break your routines. I found that I was really tied to smoking in bars, and distinctly at certain specific times and places. Start by NOT having that cigarette right after you roll out of bed in the morning. When you go out for a drink, go to a non-smoking place and/or leave your smokie treats at home. The point here is to break your dependence on the rituals so that you're more comfortable walking away from cigarettes and you don't get twitchy when don't have them. Something to watch out for here is that when you do this, at first you'll find yourself standing there going ""this is when I normally go outside to smoke and now I don't know what I am supposed to do"". Have a plan to replace that smoke-break time with a trip to get a cup of coffee or something.
* 4) Reduce your need by specifically eliminating cigarettes. For example, make it a new rule to try and go all day without a smoke. Or, no smoking over the weekend or whatever. 
* 5) I am someone for whom Self-talk works. What worked for me was a daily, sometimes hourly, reminder that ""it's time to quit"". At first my inner demons fought fiercely about quitting. The anxiety around letting go was huge. And then gradually, by constantly reminding myself it was time to quit. I was able to work out in my head all the ""But what about...."" internal dialog clingy neediness BS. I don't NEED a cigarette, I have an addiction and WANT a cigarette. I need to move on now. They are holding me back.
* 6) The Zen of Smoking - You can always have a smoke, you're just not going to have one right now. When I decided to finally pull the trigger, what helped was going cold turkey but also reminding myself that if it got too bad, there was always more tobacco. No one is taking it away from me. It's right there in the store. I am just not going to have one right now. I can have one later if I need it. This reduce my anxiety a LOT.

Good Luck. You can do it.  ""I quit cold turkey, before a 15 month tour in Iraq I decided that during the deployment I wouldnt smoke and id work out everyday (in addition to regular Army PT). I kept at it every single day and came back a changed man. Never picked up the habit again. (previous pack/day for 3 years)""You Say you have used electronic cigarettes, What ones? My guess is the ones you buy at Wal Mart or at 7/11. If that's true give an electronic Vaporizer a chance. Its the same thing as an electronic cigarette but way way more potent.

A good starting point in the world of vaping are the iTaste VV 3.0 and the Kanger mini Protank 2. For the ejuice to put into the tank your best bet is to visit a few of the vape shops in your town. They normally have a bar setup so you can try out their flavors, normally for free. If you need some websites for ejuice id be glad to link you to the ones I use. 

Here are ebay links to the two items i suggest. Ive ordered from this person a few times. If you dont want to order online you can get similer items at your local vape shops. Its just going to cost $10-$40 more.

I weaned myself off of cigs while transitioning to e-cigs."Having my first child. Never smoked again."I saw these photos a year ago. My own vanity made me quit

http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/these-photos-of-twins-show-exactly-what-cigarettes-does-to-y""I became scared shitless of the possible damage I was doing to my body, and was convinced I had cancer for a few seconds there.""While I've never smoked, like many of us I had a lot of friends who did. There is one sure fire way to quit, that is really easy, just kind of gross.  Get a little jam/jelly jar with a tight lid, one of those about the size of a golf ball. Stuff a couple of cig butts in it, then add some water so it's about 2/3 full. Let it sit for about a week. Then, when you are ready to quit, just take it with you in your pocket/bag/purse.  Whenever you feel the urge to have a cig, take the lid off of the jar and take a big whiff of the rotten cig butt smell.  If you still want a cig after smelling that, not sure what else to tell you. I know more than a few people that have quit this way.  Also, don't ever drink it, it will supposedly kill you.""Been smoke free since last spring, the only thing that has worked is e-cigs.  I'd given ecigs a chance twice before, and both didn't really do it for me.  On a whim, I bought a V2 express pack, and the improvements they've made in the business since the last time I'd gotten one made it doable.  Ecigs CAN work, you just need to buy the right kind.  Stay away from blu, Njoy, etc, in my opinion, they just don't yield enough vapor or give enough throat hit to quench that craving.  Give a v2 disposable a try, or order the express pack, it really can work (I don't use v2 anymore, I use bigger ""mods"" now with tanks, but v2 got me started)."My e-cig. Never touched a cigarette ever again."You basically just need to keep on trying. I tried many many things, patch gum (this was before e cigs), but really when it got down to it cold turkey was the only way. You really have to want to do it, ditch all props and nicotine, it'll only prolong the process.

One thing that worked well for me was keeping track of the day that I quit, and telling myself ""you got to 2 weeks, what kind of idiot would I have to be to restart at zero again."" "Tea tree toothpicks "Not a smoker here, but i think its bullshit places with ""no breaks"" make an exception for smokers.

I've only successfully gotten around that once. Only needed to once though.

Started going outside with the smokers and grabbing a coke from the vending machine. When i was questioned about it I said I was having a Coke break while they had their smoke break. Explained that caffeine can be addicting as well and successfully got my coke break.""I was 19 (had been smoking since 16). I had $20 in my pocket, which was all of my money. I owed $20 to my uncle.

I said ""fuck it, I'll buy cigarettes and figure out a way to pay him later"" and walked down to the gas station about a mile from my house. 

When I got there I was about to open the door and go in and thought to myself, ""this is a really shitty thing to do,"" turned away, and haven't bought a pack since. (I'm 27 now)""I had always ""planned"" to quit when I graduated college, but I ended up doing it before that.

I did have a girlfriend who bugged me non-stop and supportive friends, but what did it was one day I decided I was going to start jogging and the pain in my chest was unbearable. I up and quit right there about 18 months ago after smoking for 5 years. Not that I haven't cheated a bummed a couple here and there since then but I haven't bought a pack since that day. 

I was up to about 10-15 a day at that point, and being a delivery driver it was highly ingrained in my work life as well. As soon as I looked at a ticket I knew immediately if I would have enough time to finish a cig before I got there. It was difficult and I still get urges to this day but overall I consider myself an ex-smoker. Being able to enjoy exercise is the thing that keeps me going strong

**tl;dr Firm believer in going cold turkey**
""My wife stopped shortly after beginning nursing school. Seeing the images of peoples lungs and then reading about the damage smoking does was enough to convince her. 

TL:DR, go to medical school of some sort. ""I haven't had a cigarette in just over month. Honestly, dating a non-smoker was the biggest kick in the arse I needed.

There's also an app called ['Smoke Free'](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/smoke-free-stop-smoking-now./id577767592?mt=8) which I've found really useful. It's part of someone's PhD research, and tells you how much money you've saved, where your health is in relation to a non-smoker, as well as giving you daily missions to stay on track."I used to get sinus infections and bronchitis about twice a year when I was smoking. It was miserable and breathing was painful from all the coughing (when sick). I decided to stop doing that to myself in August 2012 and haven't looked back thankfully. "I went cold turkey. It was the hardest thing I've had to do in my life but it was and still is the most rewarding.  For me, it was the same as pulling off a band-aid quickly.  Doing it slowly just dragged it out.  It was a living hell for me.  3 days of physical symptoms, and then mental symptoms for a hell of a lot longer than that.

My best advice?  Just friggin' do it.  It will be shitty.  But that's what a drug dependency will do to you.""I went to my doctor asked for something to help me quit smoking and she gave me welbutrin An antidepressant that helped me quit, but everything just becomes blah, bland, and dull when your on it.
""In my mind, I'm still a smoker. It has been two years since I actually touched a cigarette, but I acknowledge that if I do, it will be as if I never stopped.  But I stopped suddenly - Cold Turkey.

There were a number of factors contributing - cost, social pressure, health, etc. but ultimately I stopped because I was ready to. This has been my fourth, and as of yet most successful attempt.  

There were a number of thoughts that helped fight and maintain. I kept a written journal for the earliest and hardest days. I maintained an Excel spreadsheet keeping track of how long it had been since I smoked, and used it to calculate how much I had saved at my last rate of consumption. I subsribed to the notion of NO Nicotine Ever! (NONE!) which I found when Googling the physiological effects of not smoking over time, another source of strength.  

Ultimately, no aide, no person, nothing will help you unless you are ready in your own mind to be done with it. Forever.  

Good luck! 

Edit: words""I quit in 2009. My husband at the time didn't smoke and didn't particularly like me smoking. I was already on anti-anxiety meds, but my psychiatrist added wellbutrin to assist with quitting. I also used those weird lozenges occasionally. I was extra bitchy for a while, but between my ex, the meds, and the lozenges it worked. 
""I guess this isn't really going to help you much, but here's my story.

I was all set and ready to quit for the umpteenth time, got myself an e-cigarette to use that to help. Had my good reasons, health, money, etc. All reasons I'd used to quit before. I'd used Nicorette gum before, too, which helped me quit for my longest previous stretch of no-smoking which was 6 months. 

So yeah, I was all set for another round of quitting--armed with an e-cig this time, so surely it'll work! Then I had to have two wisdom teeth removed. Was in too much pain to even think about cigarettes for awhile, then the idea of smoking with two healing holes in my head turned me off, and the whole idea of smoking at all just seemed gross. I've now quit for almost a year, my longest stretch yet, and the whole idea is still nauseating to me. ""I am a longtime lurker here.  I created an account just to answer this question.  I was a 2-pack-a-day smoker for 17 years and have now been smoke free for 7 years.  After many failed attempts, my success hinged on a 2 part strategy-one physical the other mental.

My physical strategy was to separate the chemical addiction from the mental addiction so I could fight the battles separately.  It is hard enough to give up the social aspect of going out to smoke with your buds and having a smoke while driving, drinking, or right after eating.  This strategy used nicotine replacement therapy.  I used the lowest dose nicotine patch I could find (the ""step 3"" patch of the most popular brand) to give me a slow constant feed of nicotine all day.  I supplemented with the lower dose nicotine gum when I got those strong, out of the blue cravings.  This allowed me time to figure out how to cope with the change of habit, etc.  After I was comfortable as a non-smoker (several months), I got rid of the patch first but kept the gum to handle the urges that swing by and assault you randomly.  I then started slowly transitioning from nicotine gum to regular chewing gum by increasingly choosing a piece of regular gum over nicotine gum.  After a while, I was just chewing regular gum.  I was a half-pack-per-day gum chewer for a while, but at least it was a healthier habit.

The mental aspect was more important than the physical, I think.  The predominant think here was a shift in perspective.  I had always made excuses about my failure to quit or why I could not quit now.  There was always some life stressor that was my crutch.  ""I can't quit because XYZ is stressing me out and I can't handle quitting at the same time"".  The perspective change was to look at all of those stressors (my Mom being diagnosed with dementia, new job, family troubles,financial stresses, etc) and decide to change my tune.  I started telling myself ""If I can handle all of these things, surely I can handle quitting smoking"".  In one sentence, you are flipping your excuse around and deciding that instead of allowing the stresses in your life to control you, you will use them as a source of strength in the battle against smoking.  This statement became my ""mantra"" during my battle with nicotine. I feel this was truly the weapon that helped me succeed. It wasn't until I hit my first year smoke free that I truly felt victorious.

Hang in there, good luck, and I hope this helps.

TLDR - nicotine replacement therapy and major attitude adjustment""Cold Turkey, with some lifestyle changes worked for me. I'll be 15 years on 2/5. I started a new job and moved into a new place with a non-smoking roomie. That really helped. Also, every night after work I'd stand out on the deck and smoke a big, fat joint. That helped too I believe. Good Luck!""I think your success just depends on what motivation you've got. Telling myself that I would get cancer did nothing. Thinking about wrinkles, nothing. How it smelled bad and how my coworkers disdained the habit, nothing. 

Now, insurance company coming down on me like a ton of bricks did the trick. I am fairly frugal and didnt want to pay the extra premiums, higher deductibles, etc. So I started by gradually cutting back. I stopped going inside gas stations, for any reason. I paid outside and stayed away from the temptation of buying them. 

The first three days of 0 cigs sucked. After the crankiness wore off I started to gradually feel better. I had cravings for years though, and I still will smoke if I get drunk. Luckily, I'm not a drinker, so that maybe means once or twice a year I smoke one or two cigs. 

I'm glad I quit, but there have been some side effects from smoking that havent gone away after. Overall, I do feel better. I don't run out of breath as easily and my sense of smell came back a little bit. Not a lot though. I smell more than my still smoking husband, but I dont think it will ever go back to being what it was. 

I also have become very prone to migraines from scents since I quit. Perfume, scented candles, and cigarette smoke in particular trigger them. I never had them while I smoked. I'm not sure why I became more sensitive. ""Worked in an office and smoked about 10 to 15 through a work day. Then a guy moved into the space opposite me who smoked nearer forty a day. Every time he lit up, he passed one to me and I had to return the favour. After a week I was buying 2 packs a day. I simply stopped overnight as I was just suddenly sick of everything about them. Not one since. That was 1984, 30 years ago. So glad I did, I felt the benefits within days. Larry the lung as we called him, passed away a few years ago. Nice guy.""You have to stop seeing yourself as a ""smoker."" I smoked for 8.5 years and tried to quit 4-5 times, once made it almost 6 months. But each failed attempt I was just thinking of myself as a smoker who wasn't smoking. It wasn't until I decided I was no longer a smoker that everything changed. If you're not a smoker, you don't smoke. It's about how you define yourself.""Cold turkey worked for me. But instead of just quitting one day, I set a date like two months away and designated that my quit date. I wrote in on the calendar what changes were taking place. For example, the improvements that have been made to your body within 1 day or 2 weeks etc after the last cigarette. I bought a ton of chewing gum and had it ready for my quit date and I pulled out one cigarette and set it aside for the night before. 

The night before my quit date, I smoked the last cigarette and went to bed trying to focus on what changes and improvements were being made in my body with each hour, day, week etc. Every time I wanted a smoke I tried to focus. ""If I can make it one more day, then my risk of heart attack has decreased by x%"" and I'd chew gum. Lots of gum. I also put away the money I saved each day from not buying cigs. I used it to reward myself with something like a video game or whatever thing it was that I wanted. Maybe a dinner at a nice restaurant. Sometimes I bought lottery tickets. So there was additional motivation there. 

The biggest motivation of all of it was my friends. One of the hardest things about quitting is always being around other people that smoke. I had the advantage of having a lot of friends that were non smokers. They were very supportive and seemed to stay involved and interested in my progress. I quit Apr 10, 2004. So I'm coming up on 10 years. I have wanted cigarettes. I still want cigarettes. I sometimes dream about smoking and have this feeling if relief of having a cigarette and guilt for giving in. But I've come this far. I feel like I'd have to erase all the progress from my calendar if I had another cig today."For me it was just not being around it and quitting cold turkey. If I needed to smoke a cig I would find something to do like eat a bag of chips. It's helpful and eventually you won't even think about it.I was able to just stop plus I was getting sick a lot so that helped me kick the habbitI just stopped."Marijuana.  [There is even evidence to show that it can be used to treat addiction to harder drugs.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24069004)

My wife and I smoked 3 packs a day (each) and tried quitting several times without success.  What finally worked was rolling about 20 joints and smoking those instead over a period of about 3 weeks.  In hindsight it really helped with the anxiety, aggression, and feelings of insanity that came with trying to quit.  I could not have done it without Marijuana.

It took around 3 weeks for the daily urge to jump out the window and violently snatch a cigarette out of some strangers mouth to subside.  Six months after that and I was not even thinking about smoking that often at all, perhaps even going a few days without thinking about it.

It is now 15 years later and I have not had one cigarette, but I still always want one.  I will want one until the day that I die.  The reason I don't have one is because quitting was too hard to do again.  The difference is that these urges are muted and easy to ignore now.

If you have not heard of [Ibogaine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibogaine) then take a look.  It is a drug that can cure any addiction, sometimes with a single dose.  It is for real and you can only get it in Mexico or places outside of the US.  I hope one day to get my hands on some so I will no longer have even the slightest desire for a cigarette. 

"You have to break the habit somehow but it will never entirely go away.  I smoked only at work so instead of going out and smoking I either read a book or messed around on my phone or ate.  Using that I was able to break the routine and establish a different one that didn't involve smoking."I completely ignored the daily dosage limits on those lozenges.  If I wanted a puff, I would pop out a lozenge and suck away.  If I wanted a puff an hour later, I would have one.  I also ignored the official schedule for tapering down.  After a week I noticed that I reached for them less often.  It probably took about 2 months total."I used the gum. I'd pop a piece whenever I felt like a smoke. I also avoided drinking for a month or two... Nothing goes with a beer like a cigarette. I've been smoke free for 11 years."I succeeded by using Nicotine lozenges. Whenever I had the urge to smoke, I'd pop one in and it not only satisfied my craving but also the oral fixation that can occur with smoking.""I quit cold turkey, I feel it's still the best and quickest way to quit smoking for good. Sure the next few days will be shit but just keep thinking of the long run. 7 months smoke free and I can now wake up in the morning without coughing up a lung or spitting out that nasty morning gunk. I can also last a lot longer on runs/ long walks, I plan on running in this years toronto half marathon! Good luck in your journey of quitting, it'll be the best decision of your life.""I was purchasing a house. Mortgage officer said he needed me to find another 200$ a month.  Mission accomplished.  I quit cold turkey, if you have the right motivation, should be fairly simple assuming that motivation is important to you. Good luck... Oh and there was a quit counter website that made me feel better about my decision to quit... Kept track of money saved, smoke free breaths to date.  ""Cold turkey worked for me eventually but I also did some things leading up to quitting that might have made the transition a little easier:

Only smoked outside

No smoking at work

No smoking in the car

I went from a pack a day to less than a pack a week.  I did that for a year or so and finally said WTF am I doing and quit.""First thing is that you really have to want to quit.  After 10 years of a pack and a half a day, and a six month old daughter I wanted to quit.

I used the 21mg nicotine patch, then after two weeks stepped down to the 14mg patch.  A week into it, I forgot to wear my patch one day.  I didn't notice until lunch.  No more patches after that.  During my quit cycle I ""smoked"" cinnamon sticks.  I still do this today, 7 years later.""e-cigs, but the more advanced setups like egos clearomizers, not the gas-station e-cigs.  Then quickly moved into rebuilds like a provari-igo set up, that gave me something to fiddle with.  Then I discovered tobacco flavors (not really the same taste as smoking - but better) - sealed it for me - never going back to smokes.
Smoke free 5 months now - no desire to go back what-so-ever. ""For me, cold turkey was the only successful approach.  I tried patches, gum, and e-cigarettes, and none of them worked.  Prepare yourself for about 10-14 days of feeling really crappy and pissed off.  But after that, you will feel soooo much better.  It's been almost 15 months since I quit, and I have no intention of ever starting again."I gave myself asthma. Now when I have even half a cigarette I start wheezing an hour later. No more cigarettes. "I would say learn from your mistakes. did you try to quit 5 times the same way and fail each time? then don't do that again! Get help from others, ask for their support, go to the doctor and try Chantix, maybe?

For me, the only thing that worked was quitting drinking and smoking pot as well. i was/am an addict, and quitting those drugs was hard. I knew it was going to be hard, so i figured, why not just quit smoking at the same time? its already going to suck...might as well...

I tried quitting smoking several times before, but i always bummed cigs when drunk or high. 

So that's what worked for me. Good luck!""I smoked 2-3 pack during a night (and drink a lot of everything). The next day was spent with vomiting, but after that I really did not wish to smoke for a few days. As usually the first days were the hardest (I also had a few attempts), the above was a big help for me."I had a stop smoking buddy (we both decided to quit cold turkey in July 2011) which made it easier to hold myself accountable. One of my older friends from work for the last 7 years passed away from lung cancer two weeks ago. I no longer smoke"I just decided that I wouldn't buy anymore. It worked. I actually didn't want to, and I think cigarettes taste solo good, but I have horrible allergies and like to run 10k a couple times a week, and when the summer was coming up last spring I had so much difficult breathing already without the smoking, so I just quit because I wanted to be able to run better :)

First 24h was difficult, because i had a hard work evening then, and liked to hop out for a nerve cigg while working, but after that first day it was all fine. ""I had an evil and persistent cough for months which I thought had to be emphysema or lung cancer. After much self-inflicted misery believing I was dying I eventually went to the doctor who prescribed a simple course of antibiotics which cured me within a week.

It left me with the thought ""What if it *had* been cancer?"", which in turn made me realise I didn't want to smoke any more. 

Allan Carr's EasyWay book helped enormously, as did taking up the guitar (new hobby that gives your hands something to do).""I got the flu,  it hit hard,  I was bed ridden for 5 days.  When I got better I did not crave a cigarette.  Smoke free 6 years.  Get the flu,  break the habit!""Smoker of 13 years. I started at 16, now im 29. March will be 1 year smoke free.

I started with the Blu E-cig. I used this for about a month. One of the redditors over at ecigs works for blu and sent me a bunch of cartridges for promoting the blu ecig. It did wonders, although  I always had it in my mouth. AT work, at home, in the car, at hockey, in the locker room, it never left, because, well I could use it anywhere, and you dont realize how long your puffing away.

Slowly I started to time myself to other people. When they lit up, i pulled out my blu, when they tossed their butt, I put my blu away. same at work on smoke breaks. Eventually it got colder outside and I said fuck it, ill just do my smoke break at my desk

after about a month, I ran out of menthol cartridges. I had to order more, with the free points I got from a redditor. The cartridges I got, tasted like burning rubber. Absolute shit, to the point I was gagging and felt nausea from using them.  That was it. I tossed my blu back in the box, and in the center console it went.  That was the final straw.   From then on, I was smoke free. I went from april, till about june, when a friend offered me a drag of his smoke while were drunk in Atlantic City. I said sure lets see what happens, and I took a drag. Man that tasted like pure shit , I was gagging, hacking, i looked like a beginner on his first cigarette. Thats when I realized, i was happy I quit. I then turned most of my friends over and they all vape now.

I only use a vape for trees , but im glad im smoke free now. I feel better, although, the smell of 2nd hand smoke makes me gag, and I hate coming home from a night of poker and stinking like an ash tray, only now I can actually smell the difference between clean clothes, and clothes covered in smoke. I have to immediately through them in the wash when I get home so the house doesnt stink of stale smoke (to me)

not to mention. the amount of $$$$ i have saved, and put towards gas instead in my damn Hemi ""First thing, the FIRST thing is super simple and is also the most important step; you have to decide how badly you HATE the habit. This is ESSENTIAL to having a successful quit. You can't kinda want to quit; it has to be firmly planted in your heart of hearts that you are disgusted with smoking. Also, cold turkey is your best bet statistically. something to the tune of +90th percentile of the permanent quitters are cold turkey quitters.

You have to have a solid support system around you. You need to be in a circle of other people who are doing the same and its important that you keep track and keep each other accountable. This can mean therapy, it can mean forums/support groups etc. For me, it was as simple as using the Livestrong app for about 2 weeks while I was fighting the 72 hours (nicotine leaves your body after 3 days!!) of legit cravings and the next several days after that fighting the mental cues. I had to log how many I smoked (0) and how many I craved (on average, 12 a day). 

I wont lie, it took a lot of focus and I had to take time from work for the first 3 days so I could sweat it out. I put my headphones on (I listened to Metallica's symphony version of ""Sad But True"" a lot), stayed on the app while I watched TV and I soldiered through every single craving. It was rough those first 3 days. I kid you not though, after that little period passed, the cravings began to feel like mini orgasms. I'd get that weird rush up my chest and I started to ENJOY the cravings, rather than fight them. My brain was making like it was caressing the sensations little by little until they became no more. I was able to drink alcohol, coffee and eat a meal and I could leave without need of a nic fix. It was beautiful, man.

 Its been over a year now since my last cigarette. Cold turkey, no e-cig, no patch or gum. You can do it.

""Chantix/Champix.  

My wife and I both smoked, which made it hard to quit.  If we tried to do it separately, the Quitter was always exposed to the smoke of the non-Quitter.  We tried to do it simultaneously once, and it was....rough.

So I decided to go alone and got a prescription for Chantix.  Not going to lie, this drug messes you up. The nausea/stomach problems were difficult at first, but seemed responsive to antacids.  The dreams were extremely vivid, and sometimes I would bolt out of bed due to nightmares.  But it worked, and     seemed to hit the ""off"" switch for any cravings or positive associations with smoking.

After a few weeks, I couldn't stand the sight/smell of cigarettes. And then being married to a non-smoker really motivated my wife.  She wasn't eligible for the drug, so used the patch and gum.  It took her much longer, almost a year, before she stopped ""slipping,"" but she's good now as well.

This weekend will be my 3 year anniversary as a non-smoker.  I still think about cigarettes occasionally, and even have a ""fond memory"" (not really a craving) once in a while, especially if I see smoking in movies.  But sometimes I pass a doorway to a building, or chat with someone in an office or elevator, and you can instantly tell they smoke, and it is nauseating.  I'm not judging them, but I do think the drug re-wired my brain to be repulsed by cigarettes.""I used the same trick I use when I go by the candy isle, just say no to myself.
It might sound easy, but it took me alot of dedication to listen to my own no, but looking back at the hard times, I am really happy that I have learned to listen to myself.""I wanted to quit.  I think that was the most important aspect.  I had been smoking since 17 and I had quit several times but relapsed because I didn't really feel the need or desire to quit.

Fast forward to my mid-20's.  I am dating a non-smoker and all of her friends are non-smokers.  I knew that she hated it when I smoked because she could smell it in my breath for days afterwards.  She didn't like kissing me or being that close to me after I had smoked, so I knew that if I smoked, I sacrificed physical intimacy.

I wanted to quit anyways.  I was hanging around a lot of non-smokers.  I was drinking less.  It happened naturally.

Now I have completely quit smoking for over a year.  I smoke when I drink heavily with smokers, but that happens every once in a few months.  I removed myself from these situations and I don't hang around smokers' circles.

tl;dr you have to want to quit and it helps to not hang around smokers or engage in habits that make you want to smoke.""

Everytime I wanted a cigarette i reminded myself that I didn't and told myself having a cigarette was a stupid idea because they are disgusting.

The important thing is you really have to WANT to quit. Thinking you should quit is no use. And you really need to avoid triggers for the first week, while the idea gets stuck in your head.

The important thing is to find a focal point in time as to when to start. Use a time that is important to you.""The money.  Cigs are expensive as hell in MA, and I was wasting too much money on them.""After about a decade, I successfully quit using 2 simple items;  Sugar free lifesavers and wooden toothpicks (plastic ones can and will shatter in your mouth).

When a craving would come up, I pull out a toothpick and start chewing away.  If the craving got worse, I would start popping a few lifesavers.  I know it sounds simple, but It worked for me.""I chewed the gum.

For like 3 years.

Then I went cold turkey on the gum and chewed normal gum like it was the only thing keeping me alive for like 6 months.

Now I'm done chain-chewing non-nicotine gum.

You never stop wanting to smoke, despite what anyone tells you. It's always there, lurking.

The trick is to not be a little bitch. If you want to not smoke, stop smoking. "" I smoked from the age of 16 till 30ish maybe a bit before. I was also close to having a kid but i knew i wanted to quit before i found out. I had said i wanted to quit many times before but only half meant it.  Honestly the thing that worked best for me was actually wanting to quit in  the very core of my soul as well as a small book called The Easy Way to Quit smoking by Allen Carr. This book was amazing. its not long or hard to read and it even encourages you to smoke while reading it. this helped both me and my wife quit smoking. I haven't had one cigarette since and look back on all the money and effects that it may have caused to my health and am appalled that i ever did it for so long. 

P.s cold turkey is the way to go dont use patches or gums or pills imo. Only you can tell if you are ready and serious about it""I quit about four years ago, and I occasionally still get cravings if I'm too idle. I carry a thing of nicotine lozenges, so I'm not technically 100% habit free, but I'm tobacco free.""I had tried to quit about 10 times before with patches, gum, and even hypnosis.  I just wasn't ready to quit I think.  Then I tried Chantix.  This drug was the worst.  While I didn't feel like smoking I also couldn't sleep or take a crap.  The little amount of time I did sleep I would have crazy dreams that would wake me up.  Actually, saying crazy dreams is an understatement.  Dreams like me, riding a flying Polar Bear naked while fighting daemons with a sword made of paper in a land made of Rock Candy.  The dreams were so vivid and real.  I was always irritable and I was afraid it was going to get worse.  Anyway, after about two weeks of this I had to stop taking it.   After going through that, I decided that cold turkey would be the way to go.  No E-Cigs, No quit aids because those just put nicotine back in my body.  I actually wanted to quit, which was a big factor for me.  ItÛªs been a little over 400 days now.  I have no desire to smoke and I am happy that I do not spend the money I used to spend on something that gave me very little happiness and eventually was going to kill me.   I also had to quit drinking while I quit smoking.  They went hand and hand for me.  So to make sure I gave myself the best chance possible I quit drinking for about year. Maybe itÛªs a little soon to say I have ÛÏquitÛ smoking, so IÛªm a smoker who hasnÛªt had a cigarette in over a year.  The hardest thing for me was what to do with my handsÛ?I chew straws now.  It sort of looks like I devolved a coke habit because there are also cut up straws around me. 

TL;DR: Really do some research if you are thinking about taking Chantix.  I personally think you have to want to quit to be successful.  Try cold turkey first, you can do it.
""The main reason why I quit is because I wanted to be healthy, at the time I was going to the gym more, eating good & working hard to achieve my goals. I figured there is no way that smoking is helping me at all in goals to get fit & healthy. I read a lot that when you quit smoking that you usually gain about 10 pounds or more because smoking suppresses your appetite & it did, I noticed pretty quickly that I was getting hungrier quicker. 

Well I smoked my last cig one night after I left the gym. I still had half a pack left, I figured cold turkey was the ONLY way to go cause I wanted out of the bad habit! I even kept the half a pack in my jeep, maybe to tempt my self I don't really know but after 2 weeks I crushed the pack up in my hand & in the trash they went. I've been quit for close to 4 years now.

Oh and it also saves a lot of money, smoke a carton a week, in Kentucky that's $45 a week. ""my dad smoked 4 packs a week for about 30 years, then one day he woke up sick with the flu.  He went outside to have a cigarette, but what with being sick it gave him just the worst taste in his mouth, so he couldn't smoke while he was sick.  When he got better, he tried to light one up, but that taste immediately came back.  he never could smoke again after that."Force yourself to smoke when you are sick and have no desire to smoke. It will taste so bad and make you want to puke and it made me never want to smoke another oneÛ?..unless I'm drunk"My Dad smoked for forty years. Started when he worked at a hospital, and it only got worse when he started working on oil rigs. He was a two pack a day smoker at his worst. He used e-cigarettes to kill the really bad urges, and slowly killed off the habit. Hes been smoke free for six months now.""Next time you get really sick, take full advantage of it! I developed a really bad bronchial infection. later my Dr would tell me that if he had known how bad, I would have been hospitalized. Funny thing about being really sick is that it prevents you from feeling hungry, thirsty, or much of anything else. It also prevents you from acting on pangs or impulses even if you had them. The only actions I could manage voluntarily were: bed -> bathroom -> couch and variations there of. On about the third day of being feverish and miserable, I realized that I had not had a cigarette for three days.  I had always heard that the third day was the hardest and if you could get past it, then you had about a 50/50 chance at being successful. Also, as I lay there drowning in my own fluids, I realized that this is what it would be like to die from some form of lung disease. You're in a constant state of panic because you can barely breathe. Not fun. So there I was; half alive but wanting to take advantage of the silver lining this illness had brought me. I took my last pack and buried it at the bottom of the trash can. I then began to assemble the most horrendous collection of garbage a sick man could accumulate to pile on top of it. If I was going to give in, I would have to dig through that nightmare. Believe me, I would never have made it. It's eight years on now smoke free. I was a pack a day smoker for twelve years prior to that week-and-a-half of hellish deliverance.""E cigarettes did the trick for me. Admittedly I was only an occasional smoker, but if I was drinking it was almost necessary. I bought an ego twist and mini vivi nova and haven't looked back since. Been about 8 months now, haven't touched a cigarette.   ""It was easy for me so I can't help

Someone asked me one day why I smoked, hen I failed to come up with a reason, I threw the cigs I had on me away and never smoked again. 

I can say, when someone asks you if you want a smoke, don't reply ""I'm trying to quit""
Instead say ""no, I don't smoke.""
That simple change will drastically change how both other people and you view you. ""Cold turkey and persistence.

Edit. I want to add that it also took me sacrificing my body.  When I was young I felt no real ill health effects from smoking for the first 10 years of smoking.  But as the years creeped on my health very slowly eroded that I just adjusted to every new low.  Short of breath and overweight was not a sudden state of being, it took the last 10 years to become how I am.  During this 10 years I tried to quit, but every time I did my health returned, I would smoke a casual cigarette at a bar, then over next month I would inevitable start smoking again.  This cycle continued for 10 years, until it came to the point where I was wheezing and short of breath all the time.  If I did manage to quit for 2 months, the wheezing and shortness of breath stayed.  My blood pressure was high and I could feel my face and neck throb while at rest, my heart rate was always high.  I've quit smoking for over 4 months (my longest stretch), I'm always a little short of breath, I really feel that it has taken a toll on my body.""Every time you crave a smoke, jug a cup of warm water""hear me out on this one, do dip or pouches to ease out of the habit of smoking. Your still getting a nicotine fix, but after a month or two, youll have broken your habit of actually smoking cigarettes, plus a tin only cost 3$, lasts like a week, and is alot easier to quit. once you feel you have no desire to smoke, just tamper off of the dip. i havnt had a single cig in like 2 months, and after 2 months of dipping i went from 5-7 lips a day to only 2 or 3 and then i stopped. I Found this method really easy, because doing dip as you can imagine is alot more of a hassle and nastier than smoking cigs, making it much easier to quit."Vape. :)"I just stopped one day. I tried quitting a bunch, but I took three days off from work and that was it.""Switching to pipes.

No, seriously.  I was almost up to a pack a day and in the middle of being unemployed.  I started smoking a pipe (because I grew up around my dad smoking a pipe, my grandfather smoked a pipe, and I *loved* the smell of it) and learned a few things about smoking pipes:

* there are a lot of rules  
* a lot of rules = inconvenient for chain smoking (light up more than once every few hours?  ha!)  
* there are a *lot* of rules  
* Pipe smoke smells 1000x better than it tastes (which is still better than cigs, but come on)  
* seriously, have I mentioned how many rules?

And I just.. kind of stopped one day.  I've still got like five pipes and a ton of tobacco because my dad's thrilled that we have something to connect over, and I don't have the heart to tell him that I've quit.  I get a craving for a cig every now and then when my stress levels really spike, but I haven't smoked in months.

I know it's kind of unusual, but hey, if it works, right?  Hope this helps, OP.""Hey there I'm super late to the party here. Like a lot of people on here I quit smoking cold turkey July 2 2011. I did 3 things I went on a vacation for ten days, there was no triggers at all. When I came back I moved, again the normal triggers were gone,  third I told my wife to support me, and she did- we didn't drink and avoided triggers. Worked great for me. 

My mother and brother Inlaw both quit using chantix. I have heard great things about it. It stops your craving and make them taste bad. You could maybe try that?!"Cold Turkey was the only thing that helped me."The only thing that worked for me was when my dad had a heart attack. He had 3 stents put in and is perfectly fine, but the whole thing really scared me. He smokes and heart disease ruins in the family. I realized that I do not want to have a heart attack in my fifties so I quit cold turkey. Feels great.""Honestly, I just got away from everything. Went on vacation, away from my friends that were smokers, and didn't take any cigarettes with me. One week later I was back home and wasn't smoking. Now believe me, there have been times where I've been dying for one, but when I tried again it was awful and didn't want to keep going.

Tldr: smoked for 6 years, quit in one week.""Mass Effect 3. Ok, actually it was game planning on how to keep me away from my smoking hot spots while I got over the chemical addiction. 

Work and my car were the two main places I did most of my smoking. I set up to take 3 days off work (wed-fri) to have a 5 day weekend. This was planned for the week that Mass Effect 3 was released. I also prepped by purchasing some tootsie pops and grabbing a handful of McDonald's straws. So for 5 days I pretty much didn't leave my house. I played ME3, chewed straws, ate suckers, and suffered through the withdrawals.

You just need to realize that smoking is a chemical and habitual addiction. It takes time for the nicotine to leave your body and it takes time for you to not have your smoking hot spots.
"Hypnosis.  No Fear."I bought an oz of kush and locked myself inside with zelda the windwaker, only going out for the grocery store and 3 hrs of walking every day.  After 2 wks I had broken the habit.""7 months w/o a cig at this point. Using an e-cig. Is it better than patches, gum, mints ect? I think so. But what I attribute my success to is the frame of mind I took on when I quit. I said to myself - I know this is going to be hard but I don't want to be afraid to let this friend/crutch go anymore. It's not who I am or want to be anymore. Cold turkey is not for everyone, no matter what everyone says about it being the way. You can quit, however you want to quit...if you really want to quit.
Edit: smoker 26/42 years""I smoked for 8 years. I equally loved it and hated it. I agree with everyone saying cold turkey is the way to go. It was the only thing that worked for me. The gum and patches did nothing but give an itty bitty buzz. What I really craved was the process of putting a cigarette up to my lips and taking a long drag. 

I also became super aware of what triggered my cravings. It was habit to smoke in the car or whenever I talked on the phone. And it was very hard to not buy a pack after a long phone conversation, or driving to work, etc... 

The first week, it was all I could think about. But you have to deal with that day's cravings only. Only focus on the day you're currently living, and you can get through it. I guess that could be said about nearly any problem.""Bladder cancer.. was given a choice.. a lifetime of cytoscopes, surgeries through the natural port to the bladder and dumping chemo.. or quit smoking

""I quit cold turkey with training for a half marathon as my motivator. The hardest part for me was the behavioral triggers, drinking and smoking, coffee and smoking, driving and smoking... you get the picture.

It wasn't until I started running about 3 miles in a single clip that I realized smoking was doing serious harm to my time and ability. I know it's an ""Oh duh!"" moment, but still, if it wasn't for wanting to run a half marathon at a respectable time, I wouldn't have quit.

It sounds silly to say, but it really is day by clawing day. I got to two days without a smoke, and it felt good to be that far, then I got to a week, and I knew that if I lit up, I would have to go back to 0 days of not smoking. Once the time starts piling up, you will want to keep gaining days of not smoking, and when you think about smoking, you instead look at it from is giving up the 880 days that I haven't smoked worth having a cigarette? No. No it is not.

A note on the behavioral part: I joke about this, but this is really how I overcame the drinking alcohol and smoking relationship. I quit cold turkey, then I would get drunk as fast as possible and then go to sleep early. This way I quickly tried to train myself to know there are times you have drank but not smoked, and it wasn't so bad. It probably is ill-advised to do this, but hey, it worked to get me over the hump of having a drink and a smoke.""This will probably never see the light of day, but the only true answer is willpower.  Quitting smoking is a testament to how strong your will is.  I was a smoker for over 10 years, so quitting wasn't easy for me.  I don't care what the 20 year smokers say, I believe I would have had an equally difficult time quitting then.  I tried the electronic cigarette, but it only made me crave regular cigarettes and gave me nightmares (too much nicotine).  3 days before my 30th birthday, I told my fiance that I always convinced myself that I would quit smoking before I was 30.  She proceeded to take my cigarette pack, and rip up the contents.  It was just the ""shove"" that I needed.  It motivated me to not only stop smoking, but completely change my entire life-style.  Honestly, you don't realize how miserable the entire ordeal is without exercising.  And believe me, as much as I loved smoking, I loved to not exercise.  Now my perspective couldn't be any different.  I actually enjoy working out, and I couldn't fathom having another cigarette.  I have been smoke free for 536 days.  The smell disgusts me.  But I won't allow myself to become a snob about it.  I'm at the point where cravings are now very rare.  I found that the first year was the most difficult.  The idea of experiencing every day on the calendar year without a cigarette, was actually frightening to me at one point in time!  But for a good reason though.  Afterall, close to 15 years prior I had been experiencing every moment in my life with a cigarette either in my hand or in my mouth.  That was the thought that provoked me seeing quitting smoking as a life style change.  And I might as well take better care of my health completely!  I began exercising/running, eating healthier, even taking better care of my teeth!  It all goes hand in hand.  Quitting smoking is a lifestyle change.  And the only thing that can get you through it is having the willpower to acknowledge that and live accordingly.    "I should also add that I've gained about thirty pounds since then. Make of that what you will. Nicotine mini lozenges and vaping a bit of Cannibus nightly "Believe it or not, I quit Drinking, smoking and caffeine all within a couple weeks. 

First up was Drinking. I read the Alan Carr book ""The EasyWay to stop drinking,"" Jason Vales book ""Kick The Drink Easily,"" and ""The Alcohol lied to me"" by Craig Beck. They are all the same message and philosophy regarding stopping drinking forever and same philosophy on breaking addiction in general.

From there, I read ""The Easyway to quit smoking"" by Alan Carr. Again, same method, just applied to smoking.

Then I quit caffeine on my own by applying the same method.

I smoked for 15 years prior to quitting. Also pick a date to quit and stick to it. If you fail, don't get upset and start smoking again, just stick to it. Don't let one slip ruin what is a great life change!""Poverty.

I was to the point where I could only afford maybe 1 pack a week unless I had some coupons. I'd smoke half the pack the first day and then try to make the rest last as long as I could. I I'd roll up the butts and everything. I decided to switch to cigarillos, and only when I was drinking. I started smoking weed around this time and stopped drinking so much so my need for tobacco to go with my beer went away, couple months later I couldn't stand the shit. That was about 2 years ago.""Nicoderm patch plus nicotine gum when I got bad cravings.

After about 2 or 3 weeks, didn't need the gum anymore.

Rode the patch out to the end of the 3-step treatment and haven't smoked since."Had to stop drinking for the first month. Drinking and smoking are so closely related it's too strong a trigger."No sap story here: Schedule your cigarette breaks, then take one away per week until you reach 0. Just set the times you smoke and set a number of cigarettes, then reduce the times and amounts accordingly. This will put your body on a scheduled system of gratification (which is less addictive, see Skinner box) and you'll be free. Worked for my mom and it worked for me. 

Also, don't bring your cigs to a party or bar and stick to your smoke breaks like religion. For example, your afternoon smoke needs to be at a specific time and you only have 1 or 2, then as you progress you can get rid of that break and just have your after-dinner smoke. 

I smoked throughout my late teens to mid 20s and I have touched a cig in over two years nor have I had a craving. "Will power. If you want to it's not hard. If you think you should quit it's not the same as wanting to abd you will probably fail."Rock climbing helped me cut back alot, I got down to mostly bumming them at bars and buying maybe a pack a month. One day I mentioned I had only had about 6 in a month and a friend said ""dude your not a smoker if you've only had 6."". It really helped me bury that side of my personality and by not considering myself a smoker buying a pack doesn't feel normal anymore. I'll still have one occasionally when I drink but it's no longer some nagging shameful thing in the back of my head.""I wanted to. 

Seriously, thats it. If you WANT to quit, you will. Thats it. All this ""Oh I need Nicotine patches, or gum, oh I think Ill use a vape pen for a while so I can still spend time and money ensuring that I have a supply of Nicotine that I can inhale on a regular basis while pretending I am not"" is a bunch of bullshit. If you want to quit, you will. If you dont, youre going to pussyfoot around, ""taper off"", switch to a vape, etc. 

All you need is the desire to quit. Chewing gum and Sunflower seeds will make it easier, but if the desire to quit is truly there, you will.

""Fuck you, smoke. You're not my supervisor!"" ~ Cheryl/Carol
""A lot of people are saying cold turkey's the way to go, but that never worked for me.  When I quit, I weaned myself off them.  Of course, it helped that I was never that heavy of a smoker (3-4 cigarettes a day on average), so I can't speak to this method's efficacy when it comes to heavier smoking.  

Basically, I decided to go down to one cigarette a day by date X.  When that was manageable and I was settled into the ""one a day"" groove, I kind of made it a game to see how long I could go without one.  Eventually the stretches between smokes got so long (2 days or so) that my body's natural aversion to inhaling poison came back.  Then when I tried to smoke, it burned and my throat closed up.  The physical reaction to smoke at that point was so bad that it outweighed any pleasure I got from smoking.  Pavlovian conditioning FTW, as they say.

Good luck quitting.  I feel fantastic now, my clothes and stuff don't smell, and I've gotten into long distance running.  You can totally do this, just remember that there's no wrong way to quit except not quitting.  Whatever gets you there is the right way!

""""My trigger is being at work""......  wrong. Your trigger is between your ears and you can control it by wanting to quit and live more than you want to die from cancer or heart disease at an early age. When you quit your life will suck for about 3 or 4 weeks, you'll get insomnia and be irritable but then soon after, you'll be free, richer, have more lung power, will smell and taste better, be more attractive and more confident because you just did something many people cannot.""Three weeks in the hospital with pneumonia.

I've never understood that. Plenty of jobs seem to have the idea that if you take a break, you're slacking, but if you take a _smoke_ break, you're fine.

If you can handle being around other smokers _without_ lighting up (probably pretty hard), you could just continue to take the smoke breaks, but not smoke.

Not by sticking my fingers down my throat, but by just doing a bit of a dry heave until it felt like I was about to throw up. After doing this every time I smoked for about a pack I quit cold turkey.

TL;DR I gagged myself into feeling sick after every cigarette. ""Cold turkey and commitment.  You have to really want to quit and not just sort of want to quit.  It still took a bunch of tries, but eventually I was able to do it and I don't take being able to breathe normally for granted anymore.""I tried going cold turkey a year ago. For me it didn't work 100%, I've had maybe a pack worth over the last year. Mainly when I'm out at a bar. In my opinion it's a win. I was smoking 3 packs a week before. Maybe I should buy a electronic cigarette for when I go out."I smoked and chewed so I quit smoking and started chewing more."Finding a sport I like.

* Going cold turkey only works if you actually REALLY want to quit.
* Try to avoid hanging out with smokers for a while and don't beat yourself up when you give in.  Just get back on the horse and expect to be an irritable prick for a short while. 
* If you have a hand-to-mouth fixation, try flavored toothpicks/cinnamon sticks/candy canes.
* Find something else to occupy your time when you have a craving like walking, music, exercise, those little chinese balls that have the chimes in them, a yo-yo..

I've been without cigarettes for over a month now, which might not sound like much to non-smokers but to those who do smoke you will probably understand that even a month is quite an achievement. 

After 5 weeks, I feel a lot healthier. I can breathe easier, my taste and smell are a lot better, I have more energy and at the end of a long day my chest doesn't hurt from smoking. Plus I've saved a lot of money. 

I'm still getting the nicotine, but the switch wasn't easy at first as it is very different to actually smoking. I really enjoy the e-cigarette now though, and I'd really recommend looking into getting a decent starter setup for anyone who wants to quit. Something like an eGo-C Twist with an EVOD tank. 

/r/electronic_cigarette is a sub with lots of people happy to give advice and help anyone ready to stop smoking cigarettes. From the experiences I've read on there, it seems like it's a lot easier to bring down your nicotine levels with an e-cigarette as well. 

""I knew I had to quit smoking eventually but I couldn't find the desire to actually go through it. I stumbled on a post from /r/electronic_cigarette ordered a real e-cig kit and ""tried"" it. I feel in love with vaping then and there. My last cigarette was about 3 minutes before I opened e-cig kit on 7/1/13. Not a single cigarette since and it was super-easy for me. 

Other folks I know need to tinker with an e-cig that gives them the throat hit of a real cigarette. There are e-cigs in the stores and online that give a cigarette-like hit, won't kill you and instead help you wean yourself off of the nic. 

For a while, I still went outside to vape, to feed the habit, but now, I vape all day inside and don't miss going outside in the rain to smoke. I was a 1.5+ pack a day smoker for 18 years. I don't miss it a single bit. 

Good luck on quitting!"Cold turkey. I then set aside the cost of a pack every time I would have bought one. Seeing how much I was spending really set in the fact that I needed to quit."I found I needed to start 3 or 4 days alone without exercise. Stress from dealing with people while craving was unbearable. Also, you might think that a little exercise would be healthy, but it just increased the cravings.

What will get you through it is knowing that the cravings will get more intense for about three weeks, but will become farther apart. And the cravings only last a few minutes at a time. Each craving feels impossible to overcome, but just wait it out. Each craving spell you get through increases your confidence and determination to overcome this lowly plant.

Also, remember to breathe deeply once in a while. It really decreases the stress. Smokers don't realize it, but they only ever breathe deeply while dragging on a cigarette, and then associate the relief with nicotine. It helps to inhale deeply through a restriction like a thin straw or your clenched fist. "Marianas maintenance program"I tapered down to one cigarette a day from one pack. It took about a year. Getting into fitness helped.

I have not smoked on a regular basis now for about two years. I still have one occasionally, but it usually only reaffirms my desire to not be a smoker.

OP, respectfully, using it as an excuse to take a break at work is total bullshit. Take a little walk around the building or something instead. Get some fresh air instead of putting poison in your lungs.

And I would avoid e-cigarettes altogether; they seem to only make it easier to continue nicotine dependency."My dad smoked about 6 or 7 packs a day from the age of 12. On his 42nd birthday he had a heart attack but lived. He went cold turkey after that. He said he just didn't feel like smoking any more. I think it helped that his dad died of lung cancer the year before."I quit with the help of a Vapor E-cig.  It was a long process and I relapsed quite a few times. But finally it got to the point where cigs started making me sick. Good luck to you man, shits not easy. "I read The Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. I finished it in 8 hours and never picked up another cig from the time I closed the book. Getting pregnant!"first and foremost - (as cliched as this is to say...) you have to WANT to quit. Even if it is just a ""somewhat urge"" to do so. 

Second - accept there will be temptation, and possibly 'failure'. 
Being able to accept that you might go out for a few beers and fall off the wagon as ""no big deal"" instead of damming yourself for not giving up is a big win for your mental state - you were momentarily weak, you gave in, get up and start again.

Third - doing something along the ""chain"" system - mark off each day you don't smoke. If you REALLY struggle, break it down - 1. Can you go a day? 2. Can you go a week? 3. Can you go 2 weeks? 4. Can you go a month?.... WHEN you reach your goals, you can decide how you wish to proceed - do you want to fall off and start again, or try and stay on target for the NEXT goal instead? No judgement on what you do. But give yourself only a few days to be ""off"" the wagon - then you jump back on.

Try to NOT smoke in the morning - set a time of day that if you wish to smoke, you can only do so AFTER that time, just not the morning.
Acknowledge your ""break"" points - do you always smoke after a meal? with coffee? waiting for a bus? walking to work? - can you break the association? listen to a song first, draw a picture of 10 chickens...anything to distract your mind.

It is a tough battle, but I think if you break it down into small victories and change your mind set - it is not that you have given up smoking, it is just that you haven't smoked for x-days/months/years and you just leap-frog from victory to victory, to a point where you might smoke a cigarette and say ""this is the 1st cigarette I have smoked this year"".... No shame in falling, just in not getting back up again!

Again - as cliched as it is to say - Fall down 7 times, get up 8.""Probably get buried, but I hope this helps who ever sees it. there was a mind trick thread, and this guy used a mind trick to help him quit. He said whenever he had a urge to smoke, he'd think ' What a weird thing for a non-smoker to think.' idk if this mind trick works, since I don't smoke, but seems like a good trick. ""After smoking for about 15 years, I finally just quit cold turkey.  Smoking was something I never planned on doing long term and I knew I needed to quit eventually because it's so unhealthy.  What triggered me to quit though was seeing my 2 year old son pick up an unopened pack of cigarettes and start ""packing"" them.  It was easy for me to quit after that and it's been 4 years now.  It was just easier when I considered how my smoking can affect my loved ones.

It has been harder for my girlfriend to quit, but she was finally able to stop smoking cigarettes by using a vaporizer.  Until proven otherwise, it seems at least better than smoking cigarettes. We aren't too concerned with the nicotine, being that it's just a stimulant like caffeine.

I do believe the bottom line for anyone has to be the genuine desire to quit.  Without it, it's going to be much more difficult to stop.  Also, I think planning to quit, by setting a date and/or deciding on a last pack, puts too much stress on quitting and even makes it more difficult.

Good luck!""I posted this in another thread as well, but what worked for me was going to a doctor.  I had multiple failed attempts at quitting.  So, I figured out that I needed to find out what I was doing to my body (which is the reason why people should quit is because of the health risks).  I went to the doctor and after some tests, I had early signs/stages of COPD.  I was 28 when I went to the doctor (I am in my very early 30's now).

I was told that I can either quit, or get put on an oxygen mask for the rest of my life.  Now, I have no idea if the oxygen mask thing was just a scare tactic or not, but it worked.  I quit that day.  Within 2-3 weeks, I no longer had any cough, food tasted better, I could breath better.

Also, let's hit the benefits that you may not realize.  When I first quit, I did not really think I would see many health benefits.  First off, I have been bad about smoking.  I started at a very early age.  I started when I was 15 or 16.  I had no idea that I actually lost my sense of taste like crazy.  I mean, you can still taste food, but it is more bland than you realize because of your lost sense of taste.  I feel like DareDevil, but with taste.  I am sure sensitive to spicy food now.  I used to be able to use Sriracha like ketchup, and now it is almost too spicy.

I lost my cough.  I had a small cough that never really went away.  It was not some big hacking cough or anything.  I never woke up in the morning hacking or anything.  Within a few weeks, that all went away.

I was able to breath very well.  Before, when I would work out, I would jog for maybe 20 minutes and stop because I was so out of breath.  I just assumed that was about the time I was too tired to continue.  Within 2-3 weeks of quitting smoking, I was able to go to 30-45 minutes of jogging before that happened.  I mean, sure, if I am doing weights or something, I can be out of breath in 10 minutes or something because of how physical that activity is, but when I am jogging, I normally need to stop before I am out of breath because I can feel my muscles burning (a good, workout burn).

But yeah, if you want motivation to quit, get a professional opinion like I did.  Go see a doctor, get some lung tests done, and see the damage first hand that you are doing""I lost a bet with my best friends. We were doing a doing a trip around Europe and I told my mates that if they guessed all 6 cards that I was holding that I would do absolutely anything they asked. 4 out of 5 of my friends guessed incorrectly but by some freak of nature the last person guessed correctly, who also happened to be my best mate. They all decided to get me to quit smoking. I guess I should be thankful that they didn't sign me up for a ballet class. 

EDIT: I made sure they didn't see, but based on the clues I gave them and the incorrect guesses off the other people the last person was able to guess correctly lol. ""My good friends dad was a heavy smoker. After he was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer he quit. He said ""Death is a pretty good motivator.""

He was able to stick around for about a year and a half. Still miss that guy... ""I know it sounds cliche- but I quit cold turkey. I just decided to stop. I didn't buy anymore cigarettes. Just passed the first month mark. Feeling good. My only slip up was with an electronic cigarette. I try to stay away from other smokers. And if I feel like lighting up, I find something else to do. Just keeping my mind off of smoking. It's not easy, believe me. Surround yourself with non smokers and supportive folks. Best of luck!!""I hate to say it, but the book ""The Easy Way"" by Allan Carr got me. I thought it was bullshit until about 3/4 of the way though and it's been a year and 2 days since I quit. PM me if you want to discuss more. ""Sounds corny, but it worked for me. I made it my 2013 new year's resolution to quit smoking. I was out with friends, got wicked drunk, crashed at my friend's place. I had a pack on me that was full at the beginning of the night but when I woke up there was 1 left. So I had my last cigarette new year's day and I'm smoke free a year later.

If you really want to quit then you will find a reason to quit. If you say you want to quit, but keep putting it off or relapsing, you never will quit. Don't bother with patches, pills, gums, or whatever. Your willpower is all you need.

Your trigger is similar to mine. Find a way to deal with it. Instead of sneaking out to light up, step away and take a 5 min walk or shoot off an email, or hell browse reddit."I had a girlfriend (now fiance) who didn't approve of the smoking. Not just because it's gross/unhealthy but her Dad had bad health because of it.  Made myself quit cold turkey for the relationships sake. Proud to say I'm 4 years smoke free.  I quit smoking 8 months ago with great results. I recommend bourbon as a smoking cessation aid."Cold turkey worked for me.  One trick that helped me was to quitting smoking on a difficult day.  

In my case I quit smoking over a weekend bachelor party in Atlantic City.  After that weekend, whenever I had cravings I would always look back and say ""if I didn't smoke that weekend"" why would I smoke now.  

Also, never think you can have ""just one cigarette"".  I quit once for a year, another time for 2 years, and both times after thinking I could have ""just one"" I was back full blown smoking after a month.  I've been quit now since August 8th, 2006 and I don't think I'll ever puff a cigarette again.""I went to college, and couldn't afford to smoke. Helped that when I did find money to buy a pack, after I had said I was quitting, my college comrades berated me into staying quit."All my friends quit"Decided I wasn't a smoker any more. 
Not, ""I'm quitting"" but rather,
 ""I don't smoke"".""NICORETTE GUM. Have it on you at all times and when you feel the craving, ""dip it,"" like chewing tobacco and let the nicotine pour over your soul. There is always a large amount of will power that goes into quitting, but I have not bought a pack since September 11, 2011 and its all been because of two things. 

1. I WANTED TO QUIT, it will not stick without this quality
2. Nicorette. 

Here is something else for you, I still smoke. On a special occasion, once every three or four months I will have one and I never even think about going back to a pack a day. Wanting to quit followed by getting the help necessary to take control over the psychological addiction to smoking on a daily basis is the whole challenge. Once you quit, you will realize you the power over when you smoke, not the other way around. Although cigarettes are deadly and will kill you eventually, one every three or four months surely will not do anything. 

Get the power over it! Best decision I have ever made. ""It took me three tries, but here's what really made that third one stick: cold turkey on 12hrs notice ( I used a coin flip before bed every night until one day it came up ""quit"") and then keep the half finished pack. That's right keep it. Keep it on you, or in your bag or coat pocket. I carried a half-pack for months, and it was torturous; but all day every day I had to actively choose not to smoke tobacco anymore. ""Not quit but replaced with ecig, it helps even when your drinking or after a meal!""I stopped smoking in May of 2011. I smoked for about 14 years at that point. Tried many times to stop. Here's what finally worked. Going cold turkey and a lot of willpower. 

  Over the years I think I convinced myself that I actually liked smoking. The first step is telling yourself you don't like smoking. You have to really start to hate it. I psyched myself up for a while and all of a sudden quitting became something that was within my reach. 

I went from being a 40-a-day smoker to being smoke free in one morning. I just decided that enough was enough.

But that was probably extremely unhealthy.""I smoked for four years, up to a pack a day at some points. Was involved in a DUI accident where my bf and i had to literally crawl out of the back passenger window of his car to get out. (Yes, drinking and driving is stupid.) I broke my wrist in the accident. I was hauled to the hospital, he was hauled to jail (hospital first actually, so they could get his BAC).  My last pack of cigarettes was in that car. Sad thing is, I actually don't think I would have ever had the willpower to quit if it had not been for that.

If you feel like you're willing yourself to stop smoking that just means you still want to smoke but are forcing yourself not to. Force yourself long enough and you'll break and start smoking again. I smoked a pack a day for 6 years then one evening I quit. I didn't want to do it anymore. I cried a little but I got through the rest of the night, woke up the next day and broke the chain of having a smoke first thing after waking up.  Haven't had a smoke since and it's been 6months.

Smoking does NOTHING to help ANYTHING!!""I freaking loved smoking! Smoked a little over a pack a day, but I had been contemplating quitting for a while because of cost, health risks, and the fact I didn't want to age prematurely. One day I ran out and just decided that was it. My friend thought it was because I couldn't afford them and foolishly bought me a pity pack. Turns out, this is what actually helped me the most. I kept that pack of cigarettes and would take one out and hold it every now and then when I really thought I needed one. Knowing that I could have one if the cravings got really bad put me at ease. Eventually, the cravings would subside, and by the time my SO had smoked the remainder of the pack, I was over it. I have 3.5 years under my belt. 


My SO quit by calling in sick for three days. Work days would include coffee runs, driving, and being around other smokers, so avoiding all of these triggers was the only way to start the process. He has been smoke free for two years.

But she went cold turkey afterwards. That was a year ago and she's been cig free since. (Smoked for 14 years). It's even a good book to read/listen to for non smokers. Really helps you understand the addiction that nicotine is."Cold turkey...with a heavy helping of pneumonia.  That'll do it every time.  I had tried everything short of hypnotism for nearly a decade.  One good bout of pneumonia fixed that problem."Hate to say it, but separating myself from the group of friends that smoked like chimneys. Not completely, but enough so I wasn't sitting around with them for hours on the daily.""After many failed attempts, I took a years worth of bank statements. I added up all the $6-9 transactions at gas stations and grocery stores. That was about $2500 in a year I had spent on small little transactions. That's what finally got me to quit. It was technically cold turkey, but the fear of that money loss was a huge motivation. ""I switched to e-cigarettes.  They are controversial in regards to the health effects, but the big things for me were:

1. No physical effect on my cardiovascular performance (in regards to my perception of my own stamina)
2. Taste great
3. No bad smell
4. Does not appear to stain my teeth.
5. Despite what many people will argue, it is not smoking.

The only downside is the addiction to nicotine that I still avoid dropping.""Cold turkey is definitely the best method for giving up.

Keep in mind that after 3 days, the nicotine has left your body, everything after that is just psychological, in the mind. You do need to truly want to give up smoking to actually go through with it. If you're not too bothered, you're more likely to casually buy a pack and start again.""i wasnt really that heavy of a smoker (a couple a day maybe, some days heavier/lighter), i guess a social smoker? started when i was 17 and lingered on until i was around 30 (33 now).. several cold turkey attempts, never really tried other ways.. i started getting into running in my late 20's so cigs definitely got in the way.. one day the cold turkey really stuck.. went months then broke down and had one because i was out drinking.. felt really bad about it the next day then that was the last of it.. the smell of smoke on clothes/fingers always disgusted me even when i was smoking.. also, i smoked a good amount of chronic from about 20 to late 20's.. when i first got into running i tried to make excuses on how it didnt really affect it, it definitely does.. i was conflicted for a while, but i eventually sort of gave it up.. i still toke on occasion but rarely now"Motherfuckin e-cig."Losing my Grandmother to Emphysema, and even more recently, nearly a year since I had quit, my Grandfather to Cancer.

I smoked since I was 12, now 27. I will be a year smoke free in February. I was quite a heavy smoker, 90 grams of roll your own a week. I slowly cut that down over a couple months to 30 grams, then a few packs a week, then a pack, then nothing. Took maybe three and a half months all up to completely quit. But it was worth it.

I have been 2 years cigarette free, will never smoke again, and I am loving it. 

edit: added:

I just wanted to add that I started reading the book without the mindset of quitting but it convinced me. One of the biggest reasons is that as a smoker you are in constant withdrawal unless you are smoking at that moment. Nicotine leaves our bodies almost immediately after we ingest it. So I thought, how hard could a few weeks of withdrawal be if I have been experiencing it almost constantly for 8 years? The hardest part I found after quitting cold turkey was that I felt I needed to go do something/go outside every hour, which gradually went away.  ""I use the e-cigs you can get from the supermarket.  I've considered more complex things because they are cheaper (in the long run) and more configurable (if you mix and match the components and mix your own liquid).  The strength of the supermarket type e-cig is that they're now ubiquitous where I live (which is in a village), the cartridges are interchangeable (if you can't find your own brand) and they're very cheap (å£6 per week).  I switched to these from the Nicorette spray which worked kind-of, except when I was having booze.  E-cig lets me continue to enjoy my nicoteen stimulant without the known badness of the humble cigarette.""My uncle smoked for years. Then he got lung cancer and died. That stopped his smoking.

It also was what actually worked for me, to get me to quit. No cigs for 8 years, I chew Nicorette whenever I get the urge..""On the one hand I don't know that I've ever been ""addicted"" to smoking, I did smoke for about 14 years but mostly casually. The one time I began feeling I ""needed"" it I decided to quit. 

About 3 days into quitting I woke up in the night desperate for a cigarette but knowing that in my 100+ year old apartment there were none. I began turning furniture upside down and opening drawers in a desperate attempt to locate a stray cigarette or undiscarded butt. 

I finally located what appeared to be an intact cigarette wedged between the hardwood and the baseboard. I dug it out with a coathanger, it was old and stiff and the filter broke off pulling it out. 

I lit up the unfiltered part and took a huge hit. It was disgusting. It tasted like mop water had soaked it and dried out repeatedly for years (probably did) and on top of that it was a menthol. 

From that point on whenever I craved a cigarette that taste came back into my mouth and I was pretty much free. 

I have smoked occasionally since then in the 15 years that followed, but along the lines of a pack a year (or less) always because others are smoking near me and I've had a few drinks - but I've never been able to get that taste out of my memory. ""You have to actually want to quit.  I know that sounds like a no shit statement, but its the truth.  Once I had mentally gone through the train of thought of how really fucking stupid smoking is on many different levels.  I.E. makes you feel like shit if you smoke to much during an outing at a bat, how much money you are just pissing away, how I was getting short of breath doing small physical acts, how obsessive I was about getting one when I didn't have any left plus the PMS style mood swings.

After going through that to the point of being just pissed off over it I quit the next day.  Just dropped it.  Now I have had a few on the occasion of going out to the bar, but that has stopped as well.  I have been a smoker for 15 years have been an ex smoker for 6 months.""Try, try, and try again. Took me 9 attempts before I was finally successful. ""Cannabis! 
Roll it into something, gives the same feel as a cigarette but by the time you're done you forget what a cigarette even is.""I tried several times to quit smoking. The longest and best attempt resulted in about 2 months of being a non-smoker. Usually one stressful event sets me off again. But I started smoking an electronic cigarette and weaned down on the nicotine levels. I started at high and move down from there, finally using the non-nicotine kind. Then I just started using it less and less until I stopped using it altogether. It was actually easy, because I started to prefer the taste of the electronic cigarettes to the taste of actual cigarettes. It was nice not smelling like an ashtray and being able to smoke it inside. It was all really easy, actually. Use nicorette lozenges to supplement if necessary. Toothpicks and candy also help. I just did everything and prayed that it would all work. ""**TLDR: Nicotine gum. Chew it when you have a craving. Ignore the instructions in the box.**

It sounds like cold turkey is the preferred method, but I want to make an argument for nicotine gum. Not everyone is able to put mind over matter as well as the commenters who quit cold turkey, so perhaps this is a better option for them.

I quit smoking cold turkey for 14 months before I hit a particularly stressful period and decided I'd allow myself one pack, etc., etc. The habit came back with a vengeance (I was smoking double what I was before I quit). 

After a couple years of attempting to quit cold turkey again and then failing after a few months, I decided to get the gum. The instructions in the packaging are complex, and some people get addicted to the gum because of how much they suggest you chew, so I decided I would only chew a piece when I craved a cig. And I negotiated with myself - if I ever still wanted a cig after I had a piece of gum, I could have one. Never happened. The gum lasts way longer than a craving.

I began to crave cigs less and less and also was making an effort to only have the gum when I really needed it -- not every minor moment of weakness. And then one day I didn't need it anymore. I remember worrying toward the end of the box that I'd run out and then need to buy another box, which would tempt me to keep chewing, but that never happened. In the end, I had one sheet of gum (maybe 12 pieces) left that I kept in my office drawer just in case, but I never needed it.

*Side note: You should follow the part of the instructions that teach you how to chew the gum and then put it in a cheek pocket when it tingles. Otherwise you will get sick.*"I smoked for 9 years and what worked for me was quitting cold turkey. I think the only way that this will work is if someone truly wants to quit. "I quit cold turkey. You can do it. Any time you crave, just know that the craving will pass. Even if you get a few waves of cravings in a row, they will stop. You have to really think to yourself, I'm bigger than this craving. And also keep any tobacco-related products out of your purse/car/home/etc. YOU CAN DO IT! It is worth it! "Allen Carrs Easy way to stop smoking book... Clean 4 years on the 17th of JanuaryThe idea that continuing a habit makes it stronger."Just stop cold turkey, it's really that simple.  Sorry this is probably not the answer you're looking for.  I was smoking a pack a day for 4 years and one day literally just said ""fuck this"" and that was that.""It's true. Cold turkey is the best way. I've been a smoker for ten plus years and I've quit so many times and it's been horrible failure after horrible failure. I have only been smoke free for about three weeks this time but I was ready. I said to myself, my boyfriend, my friends ""I quit. I don't smoke!"" And just haven't picked one up since. I do know, however that I cannot be around a lot cigarette yet because I will most likely ask for a drag or one of my own. It's not been going too bad but there are days when I really ""need"" to smoke but instead, u knit. I found something else to do with my hands. Something to focus my mind on so every time I want to smoke I knit. I've made three scarves so far.....cold turkey all the way. Why replace one addiction with another? Ecigs just make I all too comfortable to go back to smoking. The gum is gross.""There's no miracle cure for cigarette addiction. You just gotta make a promise to yourself that you'll quit, and keep that promise. That's what I did.    ""Add the cost of smoking/month and your vehicle payment/month, now go buy a vehicle that costs that much/month.  You will love your vehicle way more than you did smoking."A stale Marlboro Light."I used the power of procrastination! I just kept telling myself I'd smoke in just a little bit. I even kept a half pack of cigarettes in the back room at the back of a drawer so it would be possible but inconvenient to smoke at any time. I'm really bad about procrastinating, but in this case it turned out to be a strength. 

I've read (and my own experience has borne out) that nicotine cravings last for about two minutes and then subside for a while. 
I smoked for 10 years,  and this March it will be 10 years since I last smoked a cigarette, by putting it off 2 minutes at a time. 
""So yeah, picking a day worked for me too. It was my birthday so I had a little more motivation. Plus, I got my wisdom teeth removed that day and didn't want to smoke. By the time I recovered I just stuck with it and was free if cigarettes forever. ""Try running for a minute non stop,  your body will sound a million alarms,  the feeling you will get is how you will always be feeling 10 years down the road""Systematically cut-back your intake over the course of a few weeks.

As your taste buds start to grow back become aware of how disgusting the cigarettes taste and the guilt you will have if you smoke one. ( I also used the gum, but mix it w/ regular gum because it tastes terrible)""Using Chantix!!!

Finally worked on my third attempt. Chantix makes cigarettes taste like donkey balls so you get sick of them. Must also make conscious ""quit date"" and effort to actually stop on & after that date. 

From time to time I do have the spare cigarette but they generally taste like ASS now and I have no inclination (FINALLY) to smoke. 

This is after twenty years of smoking, multiple efforts to quit (sometimes quitting as long as three years). I've currently been ""quit"" (not counting the occasional ass-ciggie) for just over a year (New Years 2013). 

Yay me, yay Chantix!! 

Also - it works by blocking the nicotine receptors in your brain so they can't ""get off"" on the nicotine so you stop getting jollies when you smoke. ""I got nicotine poisoning from the patch, was sick as a dog for three days, and done with cigarettes when I recovered. 
Sometimes I still want one, though.""Getting away from people that smoked. I was a contractor for DoD and it is so hard to get away from that since it is the only known way to get a break. Luckily it was easy as I got a new non-DoD job and it is much easier when you don't surround yourself with other smokers. The other thing to remember is 3 days. It takes about 3 days for that crap to work it's way out of your system and you will then start to taste things differently and smell others. There is an aura of smoke that surrounds smokers that they can't smell. I can even tell when a smoker had been in an elevator within the last 15 minutes at work because it is so potent. Once you start smelling that and realize that you couldn't even notice the pungent odor, it may make you think twice before trying again. Also running helped motivate me.""I quit cold turkey. No drinking for a month. I smoked a TON of pot however to placate the smoking urge. I still had some urges after that first month, especially when drinking, but i was able to ignore them since they were rather weak.  It's been 6 years since I've quite. I was smoking a pack and a half to two packs a day for a decade. Reds/royals at that too. I still cough up black shit every now and then though lol.""I didn't quit smoking, but a 10+ year chewing tobacco habit after watching my Mom go through three amputations before dying of lung cancer.  She was still smoking.

That was a compelling enough reason for me to not give any more money to tobacco companies.""Chantix is a phenomenal solution for anyone struggling to quit smoking. I smoked a pack a day for 10 years and after 2 weeks on this pill I've never looked back. I've been a nonsmoker for 3 years now, the extra money you'll save really stacks up! ""Then-girlfriend (now-wife) wouldn't kiss me for an hour after I had a smoke, and only after I brushed and used mouthwash.""Turning 28, and realizing I've been smoking for half of my existence. Motivation and desire to quit, a lot of sugar free chewing gum, plus an app that keeps score of money saved has helped immensely. 
472 days, and close to 3000 USD saved.""Some one might have said this, but after going a few days without a cig I was craving nicotine so I got a dip from my friend. Within a few minutes the mixture of the nicotine buzz, taste and texture turned me off to tobacco altogether.""I agree with those that say cold turkey is the best method because it is. I think it strengthens your resolve compared to using patches etc, and keeps your resolve strong. 

The key to giving up smoking is less about the willpower and more about the technique and how you prepare for it. 
I spent several weeks beforehand only smoking outside, smoking a brand of roll ups that I didn't like the taste of, and extreme chain smoking. All for the purpose of turning me against smoking. 
I also made a list of reasons why I wanted to give up and what would keep me motivated afterwards. 

You also need to go into the mindset of switching off completely against smoking and building up a hard mental barrier against it. That means it's important to remember that ""just one won't hurt"" WILL hurt, and don't try e-cigs as a substitute. 

Even now I don't ever think about smoking but if I ever had just one cig I know that I would be back to 50 a day in no time because that's how addiction works. 
The truth of the matter is, if you've once been an addict once then you're an addict for life because no matter how many years you've given up it will get you again if you give it chance.

Ex smoker of approx 2 years and 8 months who used to smoke more than 50 roll ups per day""For me it was all about not wanting my daughter to grow up seeing me smoke. I always tried to hide it from her, but as she got past the toddler stage this became harder to do. So I was ready, and I had a reason.

Then it came down to having a plan. I knew my biggest triggers were being in the car and after dinner. How was I going to handle those times? I decided to take a walk after dinner, and have lots of books around to read if I didn't feel like walking. I got gum for the car. I had my car cleaned, detailed, so it smelled nice.

I went on Chantix. It made me nauseated sometimes, but it it did help with reducing cravings. 

Lastly, I joined an on-line support group. I would say this was probably the least helpful thing I did. It was good to talk with other people going through the same thing for awhile, but pretty soon I noticed there were people on there that had been there for years, still talking about not smoking. I didn't want any part of that. I didn't want to in any way identify as being a former smoker. Smoking just wasn't relevant to me anymore, why would I want to talk about it? So yeah, that only lasted maybe a month.

Than I just decided I was done. Went off the Chantix and just decided I was not a smoker anymore.

I sometimes miss it if I'm out having a few beers. I think I could probably smoke a few without going back to it as a habit, but so far I just haven't touched one.

I do think you have to just decide to quit and quit. The gum and patches still feed the addiction.

One thing - people always told me that my senses of smell and taste would improve when I quit, and that was bull. Nothing at all changed. Maybe that's just me, but I was kind of pissed about it. Was looking forward to my new super-senses.""Five alive; or some other sharp fruit juice.

When I got a cigarette craving, I'd pound a bottle of that.  It took my mind off the craving pretty instantly.""I ended up quitting after I moved. New surroundings and creating new habits help a lot. I understand most people can not move, but you do have some influence what you choose to do in the situations where you usually smoke.. for example, I used to smoke after I ate every day so instead of smoking I would play Candy Crush after I ate instead. I do agree with the  other posts that say you just really have to find something worth it enough for you to quit. I finally had enough. After 7 years my friends and I bragged about how much control we had over our smoking, never realizing we really didnt.. I wanted the control I had lost.  back. ( I was also trying for a baby so that helped as well)""Coffee.

I never smoke and drank coffee together. One day I decided to try coffee, only having it once in a great while, and noticed that my urge to have a smoke was supressed.

I kept drinking a cup of coffee whenever I felt like smoking until I got to the point that I didn't have the urge anymore.

I am now heavily addicted to coffee as a side effect, but I've been able to cut back on coffee a lot easier then cutting back on cigs. Been two years.

Edit: I highly doubt this will work for anyone else because I am insane.""This won't be helpful but I smoked for near a decade, tried to quit several times, rarely successful. Tried patches, hypnosis, gum, the works.  The only time I was successful was when I realized I was finished. I didn't set a date I just realized I didn't want them anymore and walked away. The point is once you're really ready it will be easier... at least that was my experience. Good luck friends"Truly wanting to quit. "E-cigs.

You can't get those shitty Blu Cigs from your corner grocery store. Those things are mildly scammy, since they make you buy a new cartridge everytime you need more juice.

The e-cigs that have a tank where you can buy a bottle of liquid and fill it yourself are what you want. These are found at decent local e-cig shops, and online at a trusted site like [Halo](http://50ave.com/halo.php). Also, the vapor juice (your nicotine solution) that you use to refill with, make sure it's sourced from American/Canadian ingredients.

I didn't know I really wanted to quit. I read ""The Easy Way to Quit Smoking"" without trying to put down a cigarette until after I finished reading it. The cravings were still too much. I used the patch along with the knowledge I had from the book and distancing myself from smokers until I was ready.
You need to have some desire to quit. The book WILL help if you read it all the way through.

Good luck!!! ""being cheap. I wasn't a smoker but a chewer. 1) Copenhagen became $7 a can. I was a can and a half per day chewer, so I was spending over 3k per year for nicotine. 2) My Dr prescribed Chantrix to help quit. The cost was $300. I figured I would try on my own first before shelling out the cash..and i was able to quit. First 3 days I felt like I lost my best friend, after that it get much much easier. 7 years now and I never think about it.

Also, I had recently quit drinking...way too hard to drink and not consume nicotine.""My husband developed a blood clotting disorder and was told to quit but he wouldn't quit unless I quit too. The doctors said if he didn't stop smoking he would definitely speed up his expiration date. So I quit to save his life with Chantix. He has told me that if I smoke again, he'll go back to smoking too. It's the worst form of emotional blackmail but it's been working for more than 4 years now :)
 "V2 brand e-cigs. They're the only ones I've tried that feel like you're smoking a real cigarette."Cold Turkey. If it's too hard to do that, just don't buy a pack. Bum a smoke when you really need it but never buy a pack. After about 3 weeks the cravings go away.

Also prepare yourself mentally or avoid situations where you habitually smoked. Mine was when I drove, so I took the bus for a couple weeks instead.

In summary, cold turkey, avoid situations where you habitually smoked, and never ever buy a pack"For me it was twofold.  Number one- I bought a new car and didn't want to smoke in it.  Even as a smoker I knew how gross my old car had smelled and I didn't want that again!  Number two-I got sick.  I had an awful cold for about a week and couldn't smoke.  When I got better I realized I didn't have an y cigarettes and figured why bother.  "I'm going on 9 months now and I will never go back (smoked for ~10 years). I used some nicco gum for the first 3 days. After that, it was all about the mindset. I had to tell myself every day for 2 months that I wasn't quitting anything- I was starting something new and fantastic. For 4 months after that, I only had to remind myself of that mantra once a week. Now, I can't believe I ever smoked. I'm a nicer, more confident person for it. That's my anti-drug.

Also, it helped me to not involve loved ones or friends no matter how much I wanted to. I would be too stressed about disappointing them or lying to them and it would make me crave. This may not be a good strategy for everyone- some people benefit from having a sponsor of sorts.""VAPING! I swear to you, it works the best. I smoked for years, and one day I just decided to buy a vape! Have never looked back. I can't even take a drag off of a cigarette without wanting to barf. Whats nice about vapes it you get to choose your nicotine level. Start off where you are with cigarettes (usually 16mg) and slowly work your way down. I am currently only at 6mg. PLUS! you don't stink, and there are SO many incredible flavors. I recommend this to everyone and everyone. ""AND you can vape inside. I vape inside at work all the time. My bosses don't care, they actually encourage it! ""Hands down, the electronic cigarette.  From there I could control my nicotine levels and eventually quit completely. "I've been cig free about 8 month now and it is all thanks to Allen Carr's book The Easy Way. I will never smoke again. "Tried loads of times before with patches, gums, ecigs, etc. What worked in the end was simple willpower. The moment was simply right. Combination of minor health scare (couldn't breathe properly - wasn't anything serious, but boy did it get the message home of how horrible a lung problem could be) and better half asking. Showed me that it's all in your mind. I smoked for 20 years and loved every cigarette I ever smoked, but quitting was amazingly easy if the mindset and moment are right. Never looked back. ""What worked for me was taking Wellbutrin, an anti-depressant that did two things for me:  lowered cravings, and dealt with life stressors that were undermining my determination.  That, and the realization that I will always be a smoker who chooses not to smoke.

Prior to taking the medication, I didn't realize I had a problem with depression, but I did realize I easily became angry or anxious at things that wouldn't upset others in the same way, and in these situations I always reached for a cigarette. So I could quit for months and then have my progress derailed by a bad argument with my husband, or getting laid off the job, etc.  Poor me, have a smoke, who the fuck cares anyway. I was psychologically addicted as well as physically.

 When I went initially to the doctor to ask for help quitting smoking, it was after 4-5 failed attempts on my own over several years.  Two of those times were pregnancies, in which morning sickness helped me quit but I started again due to the natural stress of having a newborn and no familial support system to help me cope with that.  Another restart after quitting was due to being laid off a job. By this time I had smoked over 20 years and at various times had smoked nearly 2 packs a day.

  I expected the doctor to give me an anxiety medication and was surprised when he gave me this instead, but by golly it worked.  It came as part of a smoking cessation package that includes reading materials to help understand the double sided nature of the physical and psychological addiction, and access to online support tools for tracking progress, much like Alli uses for weight loss.  The main thing is you gotta keep trying again, after every failure, just realize it is an addiction and treat it like alcoholism....if you fall off the wagon just forgive yourself, get back on it again tomorrow, and resolve to try attacking it again in a new way.

My self control and resolve improved with the medication, and the physical cravings became low enough that I could deal with them with using the nicotine patches at first, then later I  switched to the  gum to taper off, once I had broken the mental habit of reaching for that cigarette when my daily triggers would kick in ( picking up a phone, after a meal, breaks at work, etc).  I used sugarless gum to replace reaching for cigarettes, I would unwrap a piece of gum instead.

 The reason I don't recommend e-cigs is because the goal is to transfer your addiction to a healthier and lesser nicotine source while you break psychological dependence and habits first, then to taper off the new thing you are addicted to.  How exactly do e-cigs help you break the psychological habit of what to do with your hands and how you spend your break time, since no change is being made to those habits?  And are they any easier to taper off from than gum or patches?  At least if you switch to patches or gum, your lungs are weaning off being bathed in nicotine all day.  And the patches give you less nicotine per day, so your whole body is getting used to having less of it circulating in your blood day by day, whereas e-cigs don't accomplish that.

I have been smoke free 15 years now, and can attest that life does exist after quitting, that you do eventually stop thinking about cigarettes all day.   So hang in there!  Still, about once a year I have a dream in which I realize I am dreaming so it is ok to buy a pack and light up.  I guess my brain still misses them all these years later, you may too, and that is OK."i stopped doing other drugs first"I used to smoke almost 2 packs a day when I was a Chef, I slowly started cutting back to under a 1/2 pack a day...

It took significant willpower to do the cutback.  After a week or so of zero cigs, I was over it.

Really nothing to it but to do it. I quit smoking 7 months ago and haven't looked back. You just have to want it enough.""Bupropion (Zyban/Wellbutrin) worked for me. I've been smoke free for almost two years now.  Haven't had a puff since. Though, I'm the kind of person that can't only have one, so I know how dangerous it would be to cheat a little.  If you are a drinker, you probably need to commit to stop drinking for the initial month you quit smoking.  Since I was on the drug, I wasn't willing to mix the two.  I sure had some intense/weird dreams. I think it's idiotic to say that side effect is reason to stop taking the drug and to start smoking again.  About four weeks into taking the drug (three weeks nicotine free) I started feeling depressed.  It took me a couple days to make the connection that the drug was making me feel that way. I had never experienced depression before.  My doctor said to wean myself off by taking a half dose the next two days then stopping.  I felt better after a few days and was smoke free.  My only advice would be to take the warnings to heart about paying attention to your mood while on it.""Chest pain. Hard, stinging chest pain, possibly my heart and lungs.  After every inhale it felt like knives were coming.  It's not good for you, indeed it does kill you.""Well, I went to a doctor regarding the cysts I occasionally get. He told me they are harmless, and that because my skin has this quality, I should still look pretty good when I'm 50. I decided that I didn't want to waste this advantage by smoking, so I stopped. 
  ""I had agreed on a quit date with a friend. She said she wanted to quit, and I decided I did, too. I made it through the first day. The second day, I broke down, bought a pack, smoked half of it in 2 hours and threw them out. Started my quit again after that. 
We went out two nights later and I was ridiculously drunk. I begged for one. I took two puffs and wanted to ralph. I haven't looked back. 
Occasionally, as all my friends still smoke, I'll catch a whiff that reminds me of all those ""good times"", then I catch the next whiff and my throat hurts. 
It's going to be different for everyone, but, also, reading Alan Carr's book helped me a lot. Not right away, but it was always there in the back of my head. 

Good luck!"I hated smelling like the inside of an old man's anus. "I am close to being a year without cigarettes. I choose to quit this time because I was tired of being a slave to a tube of paper and leaves. I had panic attacks when I was down to my last cigarette in the pack. I would plan my day around breaks so I could smoke. Because I would not smoke at home I would invent reasons to stay late at work and smoke more. 
The best thing for me was the attitude change, tobacco smoke smells disgusting to me now, I hate getting in an enclosed area with smokers now. I don't associate with them as much because of it so the those triggers are not there anymore.
One day I hit a wall and got fed up. In the past I have tried gum, cold turkey and the patch. This time attitude had a lot to do with my success this time around. I did use nicotine replacement ( the lozenge )for 45 days while I worked on behavior modification . Break time instead of going out and smoking I now take  two laps around my building. ""Smoked for 14 years. Was smoking a pack and a half when I finally quit. I haven't smoked for around 3 years now. I quit because my 6 year old son said to me, ""Daddy, don't smoke because you'll die and I won't have a daddy any more"". I used the nicotine patch. The patch was the only thing I could use to really get me to quit for the long term. You really do need to use it for the recommended length of time. I needed about 2-3 months without smoking to be able to go without the patch. The more I got used to not smoking, the easier it was for me to forget about it. I also tried the e-cig and it didn't work for me.If you use e-cigs to quit cigarettes, I suggest not using ones that look and feel like a cigarette. The less reminders you have about cigarettes, the better. Also, don't hang out with smokers too much when you first quit. ""My mom smoked for as long as I can remember and I'm 17 about to be 18. She bought an ecig and chantx and quit in a couple of months. She's coming up on 2 years since the last time she smoked.

She's smoked since about 16 and she's 27 and stopped smoking around the time my mom did, but i don't think she had chantx ""Easiest thing for me? After college, I moved back in with family. Considering the fact my family is incredibly against smoking, it wasn't hard with constant support from loved ones. I still find I hit a cigarette on the weekends when I'm out with friends, but that might be once a month. I've next to no hunger for them now, and I plan on my next outing to ignore them completely.""COLD TURKEY ISNT FOR EVERYONE. It's better to ween yourself off. I used to smoke analogs and then switched to electronic cigarettes almost 2 years ago. It's so much better. Granted it's not good for you either, but it is exponentially better for you and those around you than traditional cigarettes. While cigarettes have a laundry list of additives and chemicals, electronic cigarettes only have two, propylene glycol (it's used in ice cream and other foods as well as fog machines which if you've ever been to a big production concert, haunted house etc. you breathe in plenty of it) and vegetable glycerin. There is a MASSIVE selection of flavors to chose from and most of them taste exactly as advertised. 

Here's the best part though: the nicotine level is CUSTOMIZABLE. Meaning one week you can have 24mg, then the next have 18mg, then the next 12mg and the next 8mg until you are down to zero, then it's just a matter of time before you kick the mouth asphyxiation all together. 


I would head over to /r/electronic_cigarette for more info. 

I got a great deal on a pair of Kangertech EVODs. A little more work with them because you have to add the juice manually, but you save a shit ton of money ($40) for two and the juice and coil packs are cheap and last a long time (2-3 days charge and a coil will last you at least a week for one and a pack comes with 5). 

I hope this doesn't get buried but I would definitely look into this man it has helped so many people quit and is the easiest and cheapest route to take!""This is how it went for me:  I was having a real bad day.  I had no money, I had no cigarettes.  I just thought to myself ""This bad day is getting even worse just because I want a cigarette, why am I even doing this?""  That was it, I stopped right there.  I just stopped putting cigarettes in my mouth.  When I wanted one, too bad, suck it up and get over it.  I relapsed once and started smoking again when I started dating a girl who smoked.  She ended up getting pregnant and quitting smoking which made it easier for me to quit again and I haven't smoked since.  That was 4 years ago.  I had a smoke one time out of spite when my gf and I were fighting.  I threw up about six times after that and felt so sick for the entire day.  You just have to want to quit.  There are no secrets.  Just stop putting cigarettes in your mouth.  Stop doing it today and never do it again.  You will never regret it.""Smoking Cessation Hypnosis.  Without question, the best $300.00 I've ever spent.  

I started smoking in college.  I knew I was addicted within the first few weeks, but I was partying a lot and it didn't bother me.  BUT, I also knew I'd need to quit someday so I promised myself I'd never smoke past age 30.

So, 30 gets closer and closer and even though I ""quit"" successfully over and over, it never lasted more than six months.  So I went to a guy in Phoenix for a 60-minute smoking cessation session.  Ironically, as I was handing him credit card I was thinking ""What a f-ing rip off, I'm going to go buy a pack on the way home.""  

But for whatever reason, I didn't.  I didn't the next day too.  IDK if it was him, me getting sick of smoking, the promise, or what.  But I didn't smoke after that day.  That was 4 years ago.""I've never smoked, but: Has anyone here tried going on a low-carb diet and stopping smoking at the same time?

My idea is that the diet has worked well for me because it slows bacteria that normally would send out signals to make me hungry, to feed the bacteria. 

If my idea is correct, it's possible that bacteria also influence other addictions or compulsions, and that a low-carb diet (or probiotics, or antibiotics, or something else that influences bacteria) could make it easier (or harder) to give up smoking.

It was hard and I got bitchy because I smoked for 6 years and hate to tell myself no when I ""need"" something but now I only puff my boyfriend's ecig now and again for fun. I quit regularly smoking last May. I believe it just takes willpower and being actually willing to quit and be proud of the decision. You're making it a bigger deal than it is. Overthinking and obsessing will only make you worry about it.""A friend, who had quit 10 years before, told me -- ""Just hang onto this idea. In a few weeks, or maybe a month or two, you are going to be at an airport or train station. You will see one of those desperate people, cigarette in hand, frantically looking for an exit or a smoking area. And you'll think, 'How pathetic. I am glad I don't let The Man string me out anymore.'"" And in a couple of months, I noticed just that.  ""Smokers bronchitis. Couldn't take a puff without blood and pain. Stopped cold turkey, and haven't smoked for the last six years. No temptation to either. ""I hope you will read this, and sorry if anyone posted this before in this thread but here is my method ; 

Read the book "" easy way to quit smoking by allen carr"". This helped me , my SO and some friends of me to stop smoking as soon as your done reading it. Its amazing. "The electronic cig. Works wonders and you can do it even inside your house!"A good electronic cigarette setup. The gas station Blu brand will do nothing to keep you off it, but there's a lot of great smaller devices that are re-chargeable, re-fillable, and easy to use.

Here's my recommendation for a great set up:

* Innokin iTaste V3 Battery **$35-50**
* Kanger Mini Protank **$15**
* eLiquid from vendors like FuzionVapor, The Vapor Chef, Mount Baker Vapor **Price will vary depending on vendor/size**

The nice thing about the Innokin iTaste v3 is that you can charge and use it at the same time, so you won't be stranded with a dead battery and have the urge to smoke. Also, the eliquid thing is a great way to keep on the wagon, because there's so many great vendors out there with great flavors -- you'll want to keep trying different flavors!

With the Kanger Mini Tank, you'll need to replace the atomizer heads every now and then, but it's easy. Just get a 5-pack to have on hand.

Word of advice, forego the tobacco flavored eliquids for a while, most of them are pretty bad. The best bet is if you **have** to have a tobacco flavor is an RY4.

Good luck!"10 days at a vipassana meditation centreBook: Alan carr. Made me realize what was the mechanism behind my habit..."I tried several different methods over a year to quit. First I tried Cold Turkey and aversion (you know, snapping a rubber band on your wrist when you get the craving). But what finally did it for me was nicotine replacement through patches, and all of the tic-tacs. 

Once I was effectively weened off of cigarettes, I had a hard time with the urge to smoke again here and there, and did relapse a few times. I honestly think it was more of an oral fixation... Anyway, I finally bought one of those electronic cigarettes with the liquids you add yourself. I haven't had a cigarette since, and the best part is I have been gradually lowering the nicotine concentration (my goal is to get to zero by the end of this year). ""I AM NOT A SMOKER.  I want to get that out of the way up front.  I know three people that I would classify as chain smokers that have all successfully given up cigarettes by switching to an electronic cigarette.  They don't use the disposable kind you see at gas stations, they have the bigger ones that you carry around with you wherever.  My one buddy has a clip for it like a pen, and just always has it in his pocket.  Anyway, they all said that switching was seamless and they don't miss cigarettes.  Considering that everything I hear on them is that basically there are no adverse health effects, if you want to quit cigarettes, but not necessarily smoking, it looks to be an effective alternative.  Hopefully smokers that have switched to ecigs as well will chime in and give their two cents.  Like I said, I am NOT a smoker.  I do know that you can smoke them indoors which is a big plus for a lot of people. Good luck!""If you can swing it, go on a week-long vacation to someplace exciting.  It sounds like with you, as with me, smoking is very tied to location and routine.  I quit while on a week-long vacation with my fiancee to Italy.  Don't rationalize it that quitting while on vacation will ruin your vacation.  I was in a new location, exciting new stuff happening every day, I almost didn't think about it.  My fiancee also gave me an ultimatum more or less, which also helped with the motivation (she's awesome).

You'll still have cravings after you get back, but it will be much easier with a week under your belt.  Good luck.""get your wisdom teeth out and then realize that you are turning into a big dirty piece of shit who has no more money in college. Make the decision to no longer be under the curse of cig smoking and put your mind to it. find another hobby. just don't go out and buy another pack
""I quit drinking for a couple months to prove to myself that I could. The second I was to crack my first beer, I told myself I would never smoke again. I love beer that much. Over five years cigarette free."Mockery from my friends.  The thing that helped me was electronic cigarette. When I was drinking I always wanted a cigarette mainly it was a hand thing. I had to be doing something with my hands and that helped me quit for 5 years now. Slowly I just got the mindset that I didn't need it. I loved waking up in the morning being able to breath and not having my mouth taste like a ashtray. Good luck. "chantix worked for me...  some crazy side effects which include ""night terrors"" and ""objects floating in eye"" but none as awful as the certain death my doctor warned me about with smoking (family history of heard disease).  Besides, the night terrors that i experienced were usually post apocalyptic in nature, very lucid, and lots of fun IMO.  The drug basically made my cravings much much shorter, so when i wanted a smoke, all i had to do was wait it out for about 5 min, and I would pretty much forget I ever wanted one."I quit cold turkey over a year now. But I started smoking while i was drinking. So i quit drinking at the same time. Ill have a beer here and there for the tastes but Im nit out getting drunk anymore. So basically i saw drinking as my biggest doorway to smoking."Okay so. I have tried about every method of quitting. However I never really truly wanted to quit. No one depends on me, I'm not scorned for it, I have good health. What I found is that its not even cigarettes for me it is simply the act of smoking. Snus, gum, patches, nothing helped with the craving. So I went to e-cigs for a moment went back to cigs then found e-cigs again. What I want when I smoke is to FEEL it in my throat and lungs, so I got a variable voltage e-cig cranked that bitch up and put a 30/70 pg/vg juice in it. Its rough and I enjoy the everliving shit out of it - moreso than any cigarette. Its rough on your throat but not damaging, you can literally smoke it whenever, no more smelling like shit, and you save a metric dick load of money. Best two options in my book: e-cig or discipline ""I too chose a date to quit smoking, and got some non-tobacco smoking herbs (damiana & mullein) that I used to roll and smoke spliffs for a couple months afterwards.

About a week before my quit date I came down with the worst sinus infection I've ever had, and was stuck in bed for about two weeks. I did not want to eat or move, much less smoke anything. 

I credit that sinus infection for making the process much easier than it could have been. 4  or so years smoke-free now :)""Electronic cigarette mods worked great for me but I really wanted to quit. They reproduced the tactile gratification that I got from smoking tobacco. Now I don't use anything for smoking.

I immediately noticed a difference in my health. I didn't get sick as easily. I noticed a difference in my disposition. I wasn't near as much of a dick as before. Down side, I did have to battle a weight gain but it was worth it.""I quit smoking cold turkey because I should have known better, and should not have smoked at all. Think about how much it stinks, what it does to the air quality of the people around you, etc. 

All I did was slowly finish my pack and that was that... never went back. It doesn't matter if you crave one every once in a while, you don't NEED cigarettes, so you can live without them.""Smoked for 24 years, I am now 1 month smoke free. I didn't use anything I just knew I had to quit, cold turkey is hard, but worth it..""Here's what I suggest before starting cold turkey. Find the nastiest, cheapest cigarettes you can find. If you hate menthol, use menthol. Then smoke those for your last pack of cigarettes. The nasty flavor will stick with you, and will diminish your cravings, since your most recent memory of the taste of cigarettes is nastiness.""I had to go through a lot of attempts. After 20 years of smoking, a combination of Zyban/Welbutrin and electronic cigarettes broke the cycle.   I know this sounds odd, but try and quit right after/during a sinus/respiratory infection.  You don't want to smoke when you are sick  and it will help you get through the nic fits.  "Cold turkey all the way. Granted I don't have an addictive personality and I've always been able to just walk away from cigarettes. The patches and gum have never worked for any of my friends. My dad bought an e-cig and that was the closest hes come to quitting."i accidentally smoked a cigarette with a tobacco grub in it, heavy vomiting, never smoked since (smoked for 10 years)"JalapeÌ±o peppers. I carried a medicine bottle with them in it. Whenever I got a craving I'd pop one in my mouth. It will make you forget about cigarettes in a hurry. "I switched to electric cigars. You will get arteriosclerosis aswell, yet there are known cancerogenes in the steam. So I chose a very comfortable way which is probably not the best.""A promise I made to myself.
I'm 30 days tobacco free as of today.""I switched to dip.  Copenhagen.  I was smoking two packs a day, my lungs were all burned up.  I couldn't exercise or even walk up a flight of stairs without hurting.  And I couldn't just quit. So I started dipping.  For a few months i dipped and reduced my smoking, down from 40 Newports a day to 5-10 a day.  Then i just forced myself to dip only.  I understand that it's not good for me either but it feels great to be able to breathe again.  Not to mention I'm saving money. And I'm losing weight because exercise isn't such a horrible feeling.   I was certain that smoking was going to kill me. I had to do something.""In Miami the Vapor Shark brand of electronic cigarettes is very popular. I smoke this now instead of real cigarettes. I quit smoking regular cigarettes as soon as I started the electronic one. Don't do both or you're not really helping yourself. The e-liquid can be ordered without nicotine or with any amount really. I found it helpful to spend some time in a e-cigarette store where they let you try out the different flavors. Don't just go with what you think will taste good.  Try them all out. Hopefully if you find something you enjoy, the cigarettes will be less appealing. I personally find nothing appealing about cigarettes anymore and haven't had one in 8 months. ""Since I had other 12 step experience, I found [Nicotine Anonymous](http://nicotine-anonymous.com) via [Nicanon]( http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/unofficialnicanon/info) and [Voices of Nicotine Recovery]( http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/voicesofnicotinerecovery/info) to be helpful.  I have relapsed since, and stopped attending the online meetings held several times a day, but it is a successful support group program as long as you stick to the program.  12 Step Programs work when you  work them. 

Edit: their approach is ""smobriety"", which is pretty much cold turkey, but you reach out to the group and share with them when you are willing the cravings and just have to get through the day. ""I was smoking 30-40 roll ups every day since i was 18. I am now 32. December 4th 2013 i was prescribed champix and on dec 18th i had my last cigarette. I just didn't want one. I thoroughly recommend these tablets. It is a 12 week course. It cost me å£7.50 every two weeks. Apologies for typos, on shitty phone.""I went on vacation with my parents as an adult (23 years old and roughly 5 years into my habit). After sneaking out at the airport for one last puff before the plane showed up, I just threw my pack of cigs in the garbage and got on board. My plan was to buy some more once we checked into the hotel and go for long walks alone to get my nicotine as needed. 

Quickly into the vacation I realized that this was not a good strategy and it would be counterproductive to the concept of a family vacation if I was constantly lying to sneak out and smoke. After 5 days with my family I realized that they were far more important to me than my drug. Eventually our vacation brought us to Las Vegas, which before I had gone cold turkey would have been an absolute nicotine haven for me. Indoor smoking? All the booze you could want? Count me in!

Once I got there, I realized how much more I could smell the cigarettes as a nusiance. Watching all of the people glued to their slot machines and sucking their life through their cigs as they gambled away their income really solidified the idea in my head of what these little death sticks were doing to me. I've never even had an urge to pick up another pack of those things since.

Oh and weed. That helped a lot. ""I suffered a traumatic brain injury - memory loss, physical therapy to walk right again...all from a head injury - I lit up a smoke right after impact (i was kind of in shock) smoked the rest of the day. When my ""bed ridden phase"" began, I simply never smoked again - its been nearly 2 yrs now. No patch - no nicotine gum or anything. So i dont suggest a head injury, but its funny how the brain works. "I decided I wanted to be healthier more than I wanted a cig. I cheated now and then fir a while. But eventually I was able to see just how terrible they are for you. And now its a very rare for me to even think about smoking.Ecig.  I smoked for 6 years; then one day I tried an electronic cigarette and never looked back. It's been almost a year now since I last smoked a cigarette. "I tried the e-cigarettes.  Those did not work.  I went back to smoking.  However, when I switched to a actual VAPOR e-cig that you fill with liquid..that worked great for me.  I currently use [Kanger Evod Starter Kit](http://www.kangeronline.com/products/kanger-e-vod-starter-kit) with [Halo Vapor](http://www.halocigs.com/) and it's a huge difference.  The e-cigarettes like the Blu, SafeCig, etc did nothing.  However, the actual vaporizors helped me quit the habit fast.  

**It's good to note these still provide nicotine, but you can lower the levels till you hit zero like a nicotine patch.  These are not made to help you quit, but you can use them and it worked for me.""I was a smoker for 5 years and recently quit for New Year's Resolutions, I haven't had a cigarette this year yet.  Cold turkey is absolutely the best way to go, but you can't just 'go cold turkey' all the sudden, it probably won't work.  

What many people don't realize is that you actually start to quit smoking while you're still smoking.  This is exactly your situation OP, you've tried 5 times to quit.  You probably don't even tell people when you're planning to quit any more, because you haven't the past 4 times, and to them you're digging for compliments or crying wolf.  That's okay, I believe you're more than halfway through the road to quitting.

The first thing that happens is you consider quitting.  You could be reflecting on how long you've been smoking, the benefits you'd enjoy if you quit, or the smokey smell that's becoming an ever-more permanent part of your identity - no matter what the impetus, something will plant the 'seed of quit' in your mind.  BUT, you won't quit at this point, *and that's okay*.  

Once the seed is sewn, you'll either a) accept the fact that quitting smoking can only be a good thing, or b) make compromises to yourself that disqualify or override the reasons why you should quit.  In all likelihood you'll go with choice B, *and that's okay*.

It might take a week, a month, or a few years in this stage.  Your mind will subconsciously test those mental compromises and break them down one by one, until one day you wake up and feel **obligated** to have your morning cigarette, rather than **content** to have it. This is where you need to spring into action.  Cultivate that feeling, force yourself to smoke even if you don't want to.  Build up resentment towards the habit.  Then, pick a date a week or two into the future that is the day to quit.  It's almost like you're committing suicide as a smoker, once you pick that date, you'll feel a lot better about quitting.  This will only work if you've built that resentment towards the habit, however, so if you're not at this stage yet, keep on building the hate.  This is the same technique that my grandparents used on my mom when they found out she wanted to smoke, they forced her to smoke 10 cigarettes in a row, and it quelled her desire.

Think of something you enjoyed to do before you were a smoker.  This will be your reward for going a series of hours or a full day without smoking.  For me, it was either exercise or weed.  Your quit date will come, and you might even have a cigarette on that day, *and that's okay*.  You'll consider those few puffs, that last cigarette, or even the last two cigarettes as a last hurrah before your voyage.  It will be sentimental and you should experience nostaligia, like 'I remember now, this is what it was like to smoke'.  Because in your mind, you've already quit.  This last cigarette might as well be your first cigarette, because *you don't smoke*.

However you won't start the habit, like you did with your first cigarette, because you have months or years of contemplating quitting and all that evidence built up against the habit.  Instead you'll chuckle at your naive past self, and eagerly look forward to a smoke-free life as a wiser person.

Now, you may break down and have a puff or two during the next two weeks.  This will usually happen around your strongest trigger, which for most people is a person (who smokes, and who you used to smoke with).  You might want to try avoiding that person for two weeks.  Tell them it isn't personal, or just drop off the earth, they'll understand.  If it's your S.O. this will be especially difficult, but be strong for them.  They probably want to quit too, so be strong and don't give in.  Be the good example that they can follow, it'll make quitting so much easier on them.

You'll notice after a week that you're starting to feel happier, randomly, for no aparent reason.  This is your mind re-wiring its dopamine channels to activate when you do certain things, like pay a bill on time, see a beautiful sunrise, or get positive feedback from someone at work.  This is the biggest thing that people don't realize when they smoke - for smokers, having a cigarette is the only thing that makes them feel good, even if they do tons of other things that should make them feel good.  Once they stop smoking, they start to feel happier and more confident.  You look at yourself and feel good about what you do on a daily basis, rather than feeling good after having a cigarette, which happens on a daily basis.

Another quick tip:  It also helps to quit in the physical location where you started.  It's almost like you're un-doing this habbit, starting by quitting where you started.


This whole process that took me 3 years, *more than half of the time that I was a smoker*, so it certainly doesn't happen overnight. It takes time, but in the end, the only thing that will make you quit is *you*.  The patch, nicotine gum and e-cigarettes won't help you quit, it'll only put you in a werid limbo where you're not happy because you can't have a real cigarette, and you're not happy because you're still a smoker.

**TL;DR: You need to be the one to make yourself quit, not quitting products, and the process begins while you're still smoking.**""I smoked for about 15 years, I started smoking only when I drank or went to parties, but by the time I was 25 I was smoking a pack or more a day, taking frequent smoke brakes at work and home. Being single I would go out to bars a couple of night s a week and smoke at least a pack a night while drinking. I quit by going cold turkey and running. I seriously tried to quit about 12 times I even made it a few months one of the times, but when I would go to a bar or hang out with another smoker I would end up relapsing. I tried the gum one time but that made it worse, when I picked back up again I started smoking more than I did before the gum. E-cigarettes, gums and patches are meant to ween you off the physical addiction but they don't help with the emotional tie to smoking. I really liked smoking, even though I haven't had a cigarette in 7 years I still miss the smoke breaks. I replaced my smoking addiction with a running and work out addition. I didn't purposefully quit drinking and going out to bars, but it I did quit drinking for about 4 months and I attribute being able to quit smoking to running, quitting drinking, and instead of going for smoke breaks at work I walked up and down 20 flights of stairs. "I bought a sports car. I couldn't afford smokes and the car payments. 13 years stopped cold turkey"Negative association worked for me.

I wasn't necessarily a 'pack-a-day' smoker, but I had a tendency to smoke much more whenever I went out drinking or hung out with other smokers.  The morning after some of these serious benders were the worst-- I had MASSIVE hangovers and really couldn't function for a good part of the day due to the pain.  I mostly attributed this pain to all the smoking that I did.  During some of these hangover days it felt like my lungs ached to the point where I would decide not to smoke that day.  

Eventually when I thought about quitting I decided to extend my 'break' to the next day.  The next day then turned into the rest of the week.  I felt really good about it so I kept it rolling through the rest of the month, eventually quitting for a whole year.

Now, mind you there were maybe one or two days/nights where I did bum from a friend and cheated.  In the long run though, I was able to successfully associate smoking with the wretchedness my body felt during hangovers and lay off for extended periods of time.

I know it sounds so trite, but take quitting one day at a time and make it a goal to keep it rolling.  You can do it!""Will power man. It's the only thing will actually help you quit.  I tried quitting many times an kept failing. One day I just said fuck it as didn't smoke another cig. 

One thing that helped me a lot was the app My Last Cigarrette. Sounds dumb but shows you how many cigs you haven't smoked and how many people have died since you quit. Gives a ton of information. I'd def spend the dollar on it. ""I've had several successful quits (over a year without lighting up). I'm currently on 13 months. 

All nicotene replacement failed for me. 

Zyban was extremely helpful. It made smoking less satisfying and reduced anxiety during the quit.

Herbal cigarettes were helpful. It allowed me to replace the ritual of lighting up and taking a break. Be warned, however, they smell awful and even other smokers will shun your second hand smoke.

Grit and guts were a requirement. It's fricking hard and you have to focus on quitting. Nothing, nothing you can do is going to make it easy to quit smoking. It's going to be the hardest thing you've ever done, no matter how many tricks, hacks, gimmicks, and remedies you make use of.

Know that once you get over 3 days, it starts to get easier. Don't waste a day of a quit with a slip up. After a week, you won't have to think about quitting 24 hours a day. After two weeks, your routine cravings will be just about gone. After a month, you might have a whole day where you don't think about smoking. After six months, all you have to do is remember you're an addict and not be a fuck up who tries one for fun.

I looked at the pictures of an emaciated man on his death bed at whyquit.org. Dying of cancer, a six-month old picture of a robust version of his skeletal self on the night stand, holding his child. Right next to his pack of marlboros. He quit when he was too close to death to be summon the energy to light up. Yup. I stared at that picture a lot when I was thinking about smoking.""When my wife got pregnant, she quit cold turkey.  Naturally she didn't want me to continue smoking so I quit with her.  The motivation brought on by your kids (future or existing) is amazingly powerful.  We had tried many times to quit in the past with varying results, never lasting more than a couple months.  We are now almost 3 years smoke free.""you have to want to!  I just stopped and am using the eGo-C Twist electronic.  I use the tobacco flavor and also some other flavors to mix up a little bit.  It seems like I use the ecig a lot more than I did regular smokes, but I don't really have a craving for a regular cigarette anymore ""Former smoker of 10 years ,  the prescription pill Champix made it ridiculously easy to quit .  1 and a half prescriptions , roughly 3 weeks which included the first 10 days of me smoking as per normal.   If you cant quit with this method,  deep down inside you dont want to quit smoking. ""I quit in 2008. Prior to that I was smoking about 2 packs a day, and had been for many years. The only thing that worked, unfortunately, was cold turkey and determination. The patch, the gum... these things just pull the bandaid off so slowly. 

I started chewing a LOT of sunflower seeds, and that helped take the edge off because at least it gave my mouth something to do. 

Quitting was the hardest thing I've ever done, but God damn if it isn't worth it. Another thing I did was start jogging. My lungs healed quickly and it felt like I was gaining super powers being able to run further and further. 


Don't ever stop trying. I don't ever even think about smoking anymore, quitting was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Good luck. ""Hi, RN here, I'd like to add to what everyone else is saying, it sounds like the most effective method for the community is to quit cold turkey, and that sounds about right.  After all, other methods like nicotine patches just replace the dependence, and it sounds like you want to get rid of it.  I understand that the anxiety related to quitting can be a lot, so I recommend you try to find a coping mechanism that helps distract you from the anxiety, and use it whenever you feel the kick.  Also, you might consider asking your doctor about a mild anti-anxiety medication like Zyban (AKA Wellbutrin), the cool thing about this medication is there is unlike other medications there are usually no side effects and it does not form dependence, it can help with the anxiety, however the most important tool is motivation, find what motivates you and use it.""The most effective method for me was avoiding other smokers.  

I had started out by not buying packs and relied on throwing a dollar or so at my smoker buddies every time I wanted to smoke - but I found myself just getting broke faster.  After that, I just stopped hanging around the smoking area at work.  

Cold turkey + avoiding my social smoking trigger did it for me.""What started the process for me was switching to making my own with pipe tobacco.  You'd be surprised how many addictive chemicals are in regular, brand-name cigarettes.  Gradually, my smoking went down, until in August I was finally able to quit for good.  I don't miss it, either, even when my husband lights up.""I'm sure it's been said, but Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking worked for me. I've been 14 months without a cigarette. The book really helped put my mind in the right place to make an honest effort at quitting. 
That being said, having my spouse quitting with me was a big factor as well. Not having another smoker in the house made it infinitely easier. 
Good luck! ""I just stopped buying a pack ... helped me
""I quit around 3 years ago, from a 20 a day habit. Tried the cold turkey method and ended up a nasty piece of work, to be honest i wasn't too bothered about quitting, the Mrs had recently quit and was now a martyr for stopping! 
I got on the subject with a colleague at work who had at that point stopped smoking for 3-4 months.
He quit using a drug available on the NHS called Champix, so the day after i called my surgery and asked to be seen.
It was explained how the drug works, that i'd still smoke whilst taking the tablets, that i'd be required to visit the doctors once every 2 weeks for a further prescription and that i should be smokes free within 12 weeks...sounds good! 
So the program began. It took around 3 weeks for a noticeable change, i lit up one morning, inhaled and didn't get the usual feeling of satisfaction...by the end of the second packet of tablets i was lighting a cigarette, inhaling once or twice and then putting it out as there was just no point in smoking it all.
I decided that i'd try and quit at the end of the 5th week, by the end of the 6th week i'd not lit up, id twiddled quite a few pens but never lit up.
4th visit to the doc's, explained that i'd not smoked in a week and was advised that i should get a 4th prescription and try to cut the dose down by half... by the 7th week i'd still not lit up so began weening.
8th week done, down to 1/4 dose and still had a few pills left...so i decided no more Champix.

Safe to say i have never looked back, never once missed smoking, can be around other smokers.

Certainly wasn't that difficult!

Every time I would get a craving I would take a massive hit and the cravings dissapear instantly. I did that for about a week and now I cant even take the smell of a cigarette now."The best I did for me was educating myself about the effects when quitting.

The addiction response is often too painful for smokers to endure--which is absolutely NUTS NUTS NUTS, in my opinion. The very reason that you CONTINUE to smoke is the addiction response. You continue to smoke BECAUSE it's more stressful to quit. As if smoking is relieving any actual stress, smokers have been convinced they feel more comfortable by smoking. THIS IS WRONG. Smokers are constantly being made more and more UNCOMFORTABLE because of the addiction. If it weren't for addiction, you wouldn't have constant headaches, increased irritability, or negative emotions like sadness (as often). You continue to smoke because the addiction response is being activated EVERY SINGLE DAY.

As a smoker, EVERY DAY is about enduring and relieving withdrawal symptoms. As a quitting smoker, one to two months are about enduring somewhat stronger withdrawal symptoms. The payoff is worth the sacrifice of comfort, because the comfort after quitting is much better than the ""comfort"" one gets by smoking.

The addiction equation is this:
Smoker needs a certain amount of nicotine at any given moment. Their nicotine levels are always dropping. As the levels drop, the body gets a little stressed out. As levels continue dropping, the stress intensity increases. They will stress more and more until they smoke. Once they smoke, the levels are replenished and the body is less stressed. Immediately, the levels begin to drop again, and the body begins to stress again. Until they smoke, the body will become more and more stressed.

After quitting, you immediately have more spending income. Your senses become more reliable. You smell is less repulsive to other people, making you more approachable. You're less stressed out because you're not going through withdrawal every single day.

All of these quitting side effects are temporary, and life after this is much improved over the painful life of chronic smoking addiction. ""The doctor telling me that for the next month after skull base surgery, a single drag could kill me. 

Seriously, though, cold turkey's the only way. You're on a 30-day purge after your last drag. Any new drag, e-cig or analog, starts the countdown over. 

Find resilience and take each craving at a time. They'll last about 30 minutes at first, but they'll slowly get shorter and farther between. Godspeed. ""I had to keep several reasons to remind myself: 1.) My father was one of the strongest and finest men I've known; the chemicals the cigarette companies slathered on this piece of paper with some weeds and a filter was so incredibly addictive, in his case, it killed him. 2.) I wanted to be an Example to my son in being able to overcome something, even though it was difficult (and I never smoked in the home - he would check on me outside, though) 3.) Determination: Even though it took me several times to quit for good; I forgave myself for falling off and the next time I was more determined to not allow Big Tobacco to win.
I had quit for 2 years once and an evening at a bar with friends I thought I could just have 'one'; was a year and a half after that 'one' before I quit again. 3.) Saw other long term smokers (especially women) and was horrified that my mouth would end up looking like my anus (vanity). 4.) Was also disgusted after quitting and realizing that I had smelled like a combination of a dirty ashtray and vomit when I smoked; a smell that a smoker doesn't smell when they are addicted - but everyone else does. I had tried several methods, including cold turkey (brutal); the patch helped me most. The e-cigs were not out when I was quitting; but those have helped my sister (one who would not even discuss quitting prior).  I have not smoked cigs for over 9 years now and am SO grateful to be free of that addiction. Please, keep trying, it is so worth it. Don't let those companies who addicted you win by killing off another good person. Others need you and you CAN do it. Just remember, however strong those urges are; they usually only last a couple of minutes: breathe deep, go for a walk, get through it. And, yes, things will happen the day you quit that will challenge you; mainly because you have to relearn to do almost everything - including dealing with emotions - BUT it is so worth it and the urges WILL pass. Good luck and I'm cheering for you.
"Moving from where the price of a pack was $3 to somewhere it was $10+. Nicotine lozenges"Cold turkey. It sounds so simplistic, but I finally managed to quit 8 months ago by just telling myself that is was just no longer an option. If you can say to yourself that cigarettes just don't exist for you anymore, you stop thinking of them as part of your life. It's hard as hell, but WAY easier than the illnesses and risks that come with being a smoker. Good luck!""Ecigarettes, yes I know I'm replacing one vice for another. I'm happy with it though""2 things worked in combination.  Started bumming my friend's American Spirit mediums.  Revolting.  Couldn't take more than a drag before I became nauseous.  Got conditioned Clockwork Orange style.  

Then, I moved to LA.  People only smoke in their own cars.  It's just not around.  

Had no intention of quitting really.  It just went away by itself."Getting pregnant. Quitting was pretty easy once I knew. Smoked for 12 years but always said I'd quit if I got pregnant so that was that. "First off, wtf is wrong with your work/insurance? You only get a break if you smoke? Idk where you are, but that's gotta be a labor law violation. And what kind of health insurance gives people incentive to smoke? Fucked up.

Anyway, to answer your question, I have two triggers I've identified: falling out with a SO, and like you, work makes me crave.

Cold turkey worked well for me once, I quit for three years (until a breakup with a SO, a few bummed smokes on nights of heavy drinking and I was back in the habit). The first month was absolute hell, for me and everyone around me I'm sure, but after that it was smooth sailing.

This time around I'm using an e-cig. What kind of e-cig rig are you set up with? Maybe you need a stronger nicotine concentration? I didn't like Blu (the brand that kinda looks like an actual cig), so I got a rig with the battery and refillable chamber & mouthpiece. I had to shop around to find some juices strong enough where I like the flavor. I bought my rig four months ago and haven't craved an analog cigarette since. My advantage to you here is I can vape at work, so I don't even have to step outside to puff.

Also, find something to do to keep your hands/mind busy when you have a craving, a lot of my smoking habit was reinforced by the ritual of smoking. Find something productive and/or healthy: jog around the block (you CAN if you're not a smoker). Peel a banana and eat it. Knit a scarf for 10 minutes. Give yourself an alternative addiction, something that won't make you feel sick and guilty, but rather healthy and accomplished.""I've been smoking the e-cigs (vaporizors, not those shitty plastic cigarettes) for over a year now.""ECIG. Smoked 17 a day. Havent smoked in 3 years. I vape all the time though :P

Then I quit that job.  "Which Electronic Cigarette do you have? "I stopped buying them. pack and a half a day to 0, going 14 months and strong. It sucked for the first month sure, but if I didn't buy them, I couldn't smoke them. My laziness won over my addiction. Side benefit, after a month I figured 'well shit if I can quit smoking I can lose weight too' and thanks to keto and some exercise, I've lost 130lbs. From 335 to 205, hooray.""Read the book 'the easy way to stop smoking' by Allen Carr. The guy has actual centers throughout Europe. His success rate is phenomenal, just look at the ratings on Amazon:D Can't explain why it works, it just does!""I'd be amazed if it's not already mentioned somewhere else in this thread, but a year ago when my wife got pregnant with my son, I was *strongly urged* to quit smoking. I was smoking a pack or two a day and even if I did it when she wasn't around the smell would linger and make her nauseas.. So, I *upgraded* to ecigs, or as I prefer to call it, vaping.

Those shitty little cigarette looking devices they sell at the gas station, IMHO, are complete garbage. I went all out and got some mid-high end gear and couldn't be happier. I can adjust the pull, the temperature, the amount of vapor, the amount of nicotine to be juuuuust right. I can set it to fog out my car with just a couple puffs, in case you were thinking that they are all too puny and won't quench your cravings. I've got some delicious flavors that smell and taste wonderful.. But best of all, my cough is GONE and I can notice a HUGE difference in my health. My lung capacity has skyrocketed and my sense of smell and taste sometimes make me feel like a werewolf. Me and my clothes don't stink, and I now find cigarettes smell abysmal and taste like an ashtray. Since vaping doesn't have the thousands of carcinogenic compounds found in cigs, I've found that there was something else in those Marlboros aside from nicotine that was making me crave them so bad. I used to only be able to go 20-30 minutes before needing to light up again, now I can easily spend a whole work day without even thinking about it.

TLDR: Vaping/ecigs have changed my life.. But for me, I needed a powerful, high end device that I could set just right. Don't write them off if you've only tried those crappy gas station specials..""I found a wonderful site that helped me understand how nicotine addiction works and gave me the information I needed to finally succeed at a cold turkey quit.  http://www.whyquit.com  There are some great articles and videos, free site no account required.  I started reading during a slow day at work, just to educate myself, and the info was so compelling that I simply threw away 1/2 a pack and have not had a single puff since.  That was 2 1/2 years ago.  ""They also have links to download a few different quit counter programs/apps.  When I need to feel good about something I just check my stats.

The patches and gum didn't work for me, so I resorted on quitting cold turkey. It will be 10 months come the first. This may sound like a silly idea, but, I did 40 days of fasting before hand. No eating during the day only after dusk. My mind went crazy trying to convince me things like soup wasn't really food or yogurt wasn't either. After learning how to tell myself no, I became disciplined to my urges and I was able to transfer that discipline over to quitting smoking after those 40 days. Hope that helps and good luck!!"I got pregnant. It's a lot easier to quit when you have something to quit for."Researching the Tobacco Industry. Learning how ammonia is added to reconstituted leaf which basically causes the nicotine to be freebased, making the addiction that much worse. I got mad at the industry and myself for spending so much money on such a useless drug.

I started buying American spirit pipe tobacco and rolling my own because pipe tobacco isn't taxed as much as cigarette rolling tobacco. The American Spirit doesn't have ammonia, so it lessened the nicotine effects. Rolling my own made it more of a chore to smoke. Instead of just whipping out a cigarette and lighting up, I had to spend a minute or more putting the thing together. For the first year, I also cut back heavily on coffee and alcohol since they were almost always accompanied by smoking.

I also started using a combination of a patch and the gum. The gum was something to reach for instead of a cigarette when I got the cravings, after a few minutes I forgot about wanting a cigarette. The patch lessened morning cravings right after waking up. The patch also caused me to have crazy vivid dreams, which I enjoyed for the most part.

I still carry nicorette lozenges with me for when I get really stressed and might think about smoking, especially while driving to and from work. I haven't used any tobacco products in over 2 years at this point, and don't see me going back after all the money I've saved and noticeable health improvements.""> after a few minutes I forgot about wanting a cigarette.

Interesting how your mind convinces you it's imperative to smoke at any given time and how you feel you ""can't live without it"" then after a few minutes you forget about it entirely. Been there dude. Nicotine is a hell of a drug.
""What worked for me was the mantra, ""I haven't quit smoking. I'm just not going to have one today.""

Quitting was strangely terrifying and depressing. But that thought that I'll have one again sometime in the future got me through. It's been 15 years since I quit and I never, ever think about lighting up any more.""Cold turkey. The only thing that worked. It was hellish for maybe a month, slightly less so for a few more months and by two years I knew I wouldn't go back.""i had some sort of a bronchial infection with an embarrassing cough...totally humiliating cough. when it began, i would just light up when i finished coughing.  this time, however, people STARED at the fool smoking.  Basta! enough!! cold turkey.... 2 days later, i felt fine.  i found some smokes a few months later and tried one but the magic was gone.... haven't smoked since April, 2007.""Chantix on the third try.  I think what helped most was that I stopped drinking for a few months beforehand.  Anytime I ever quit and fell back into smoking, that first cig came while drinking.  Been tobacco free for
4 years this April.  My wife quit at the same time and we both quit because she was pregnant.  Not wanting out son around second hand likely helped too.""I wasn't quite the big smoker but I smoked for about 3 or 4 years half a pack a day (10 cigarettes approximately). The thought of quitting was always not far behind but had not put myself into it. So on one day (1 year and 3 months ago) I just woke up, had no smokes and decided to quit right away. It was really hard but the only thing that help you is to repeat your goal in your head. Seriously there is no magic trick. Only keep up and fight. 

oh and my gf just quitted 2 months ago, the same way!

We are now in complete disgust whenever we smell it :-P
sorry, english isn't my primary language..

KEEEPPP UPPP""I'm probably too late to this... but here it is anyway. 

I smoked for more than 10 years, typically more than a pack a day. I tried everything in the world to stop, including patches, gum, Chantix, some weird asian seeds taped to my ears, tapering down, and much more. The best thing for me was to quit cold turkey, with a half a pack sitting on my counter, just staring at me. 

Two things helped this process. First, I quit at night, so by the time I woke up, I already had 8 hours smoke free under my belt. That is mentally important. Second, was leaving that pack of cigarettes on my counter. It made me have easy will power during those first few days. Physically quitting is the easy part, which is why its important to physically stop yourself during those first few weeks to strengthen your mental ability to stop. 

So far, it is been a smooth 3.5 years. Not one setback!


""I used an Ecig to quit. Used it for about 3 months, weening the nicotine content of the e-liquid down the whole time. As of 2 weeks ago i've been nicotine free. I still have cravings occasionally but it was a lot easier than i thought it'd be. ""I promised my future wife I'd quit before we got married. I'm a big on keeping my word. So that, and a full supply of nicotine patches and I no longer smoke. Before this I had smoked for 15 years.

Water, lots of water too.
""Cold Turkey .... Told myself ""Why am I smoking this? It makes me smell bad, taste bad, cost a decent amount of money, and quite honestly hardly makes me feel anything good."" Tried taking 2 weeks off... bought a pack.

I had an evod for 7 months but still smoked as much as i used it, than upgraded to a better unit that produced more vapor and allowed me to adjust my hit so to speak. It's bern a wrap since.

Source...I smoked for 20 years and have been successfully nicotine free for 1 and a half years now.""Well, I am less than a year quit but I have not thought about smoking or had even one drag since I quit cold turkey. A lot of people say it doesn't work, but I felt like it was the only way for me. I had been thinking about quitting for the longest time for all the reasons anyone wants to quit, but always kept putting it off for that last cigarette. One day I was having one and started feeling shitty in general, coughed up some nasty shit, and I just realized that it was my last one. I didn't even want to finish it. I just flicked it, went back inside, and crushed and threw out the new [minus one pack] carton I had just bought the day before. I have never been happier.""I smoked for 16 years.  I am smoke free since Nov 12 2013.  It took patches and gum at the same time.  I also used the e cig when drinking or around people who smoke.  Every day gets easier.  If you fail, just keep trying.""I know others will burn me at the stake for this, but I quit smokeing useing a personal vaporizer commonly known as an electronic cigarette. Im not talking about a blu kit or anything like that, those are garbage and will turn you completely off of them. The kind folks at r/electronic_cigarette will be able to answer and questions and dispel any myths you might have. Public fear mongering has really hurt the community and put out alot of lies about the products but there is actual scientific studys that have proven them to be less harmful and less carcinogenic than there analog counterparts. If any one has questions about these devices I did a research paper on the subjuct and would be happy to share just lemme know and I will post the link.""Allen Carr's Easy Way worked wonders for me. I had come to the point in my life where I was embarrassed by any physical activity as well as ashamed to smoke in front of anybody. Let alone financial feasibility. 

I read the book with an open mind. I didn't expect it to be some miracle cure, yet I also didn't think it was a hoax. I followed each of the steps to a ""T"" and have been successful for 1.5 years now. I used to fear craving that dirty cigarette in the future. Now, I still have cravings. It lasts for exactly 5 seconds before I stop thinking about it. And I only get a craving once a week.

It is absurdly easy to get a copy of this book. I had an iPhone at the time and purchased the e-copy. My logic at the time was that it was $10. Cheaper than a pack of smokes (in Canada)!! I thought to myself that if it didnt work, who cares. It would have been like smoking 1 more pack. Little did I know that later on it would be the best 10 bucks I have ever spent. "[deleted]I have to disagree with step one. A lot of arguments could have been avoided with my wife if I just never told her I quit.Worked for me. Switch to e cigs. They will he great for awhile until you get fed up with upkeep. At that point you'll just put them down normally. I had a blood clot a couple years ago because smoking constricts your blood vessels. That was a pretty good reason for me."I had been at 8-10 cigarettes a day since the 90's. Quit completely in 2011, absolutely no desire to light up again. It was essentially cold turkey, but actually a 2-step process for me. 

I started new job in 2007 and resolved to not smoke at work. It was a very busy job, so I hardly had time to pop out for a drag. This helped to keep my mind off cigs for most of the day, and soon I wasn't even feeling the cravings at work. I still needed one cigarette before work every morning and at least 4-5 every evening (more if I went out for drinks or dinner)

In early 2011, thanks to a various circumstances, I had to go to more parties/ social occasions than usual. Now, my biggest smoke cravings would always happen every time I was out drinking. This meant that over a two-month period I was out smoking, drinking and inevitably hungover very often. Everytime I was hungover, I wouldn't feel like smoking until the evening.

After one particularly bad hangover, I simply couldn't take it anymore (I was already in my early 30s at this point, so maybe age had something to do with it). Even the sight of the  was repulsive for a while. I decided to take this opportunity to quit. I spent more time at work (where I didn't crave cigs anyway) and in the evenings, I would just remind myself of how awful the last hangover felt.

For a few months, the cravings would come back periodically, but they were surprisingly mild. I had braced myself for some serious withdrawal, but I it never came - I guess I was just lucky.

Nowadays, there's no craving at all. I can be around cigarettes and smokers with no problem. "I got really sick. It was either a bug or a flu and I felt like throwing up when I had a smoke. So after about a week and a bit my urge somehow went away and haven't had a smoke in >2 years."A combination of smokes going up to over $10 a pack and me quitting drinking for several months at the same time. 

I had ""quit"" several times before that, and I was fine until I had a beer or two. So I went for two or three months without any drinks, and I was able to quit. Still wasn't easy, but it was nice to finally have a beer again and not get a huge craving for a smoke. ""Champix

awesome pill!
""Exercise combined with electronic cigs, patches and gum. The latter helped me cut down and distance smoking from certain activities. And believe it or not, nicotine was easier to quit than whatever other crap it is that they put in cigarettes. 

Exercise provided much of the motivation, I was doing sets and reps that weren't particularly hard but still spending a couple minutes trying to catch my breath in between. And cardio was a huge pain in the ass while being a smoker. At some point my lungs became the limiting factor in progression (especially being at 6k feet).

And that gasping, shallow panting breathing that you have when trying to exercise as a smoker... I kept thinking, this is very likely how I could spend the last few years of my life. Unable to catch my breath for years while slowly suffocating to death. Emphysema is a horrific way to die. And technically it could start any day. Fuck no. No thank you.""Something I did was the day I thought, ""I need to stop smoking cigarettes,"" I told myself ""alright, I'm done. I'm free. See that was easy now wasn't it?"" 
I stopped because I decided I needed them too much in my life, and I didn't want to become dependent on them. ""Setting a date in the nearish future, smoking my nuts off till the end (so much so that I was dying to give up by then). Then having some nicotine chewing gum and reducing the dosage over days, then weeks. Giving them up too, but keeping a pack (of chewing gum) in case of jitters. Gave up 15 years ago like that. "[deleted]I would agree with caution. Chantix has some pretty strong side-effects. I tried it a long time ago and I'll never forget the kind of dreams I had while taking it. It's how my mom quit though!"The first time I quit cold turkey I made a big deal of it like I think a lot of people do.  At first it was great, having a lot of congrats and well done! thrown my way but after a few months those go away and I had no motivation left.  I was so concentrated on the number of days since my last cig and I think that hurt me.

The second time I straight up just didn't feel like having a cig one day.  I decided that was my time to quit.  I stopped paying so much attention to the date I quit and just took it one craving at a time.  I let myself have a cig at the bar if I was drunk etc. and didn't punish myself if I slipped up.  After a few months those random cigs started tasting like shit and made me feel terrible.

My bf then followed suit and we decided to start running.  The way your lungs feel after a run when you've smoked for 10 years.....that's what finally did it.  I didn't have high bp or cough a lot or any of the physical things people point to to get you to quit.  We rolled our own (another factor that I think helped us quit - not as many of the synthetic chemicals to intentionally hook you) so the money argument wasn't really there either.  But holy shit.....run a mile and see all the gunk come out of my lungs....that was a game changer.  

Fast forward 2.5 years we have run multiple half marathons, he's ran a full.  We're training for a half in April and a full later this year and we almost never have cravings.  It was also a motivator to eat better and pay attention to other health related issues.  It was a good chain reaction.

My advice to you: find something else to do with your hands that can be done in short increments (like the 5-7 mins you would spend smoking).  I had a friend that took up knitting and would knit for a few minutes any time she had a craving.  Most of all - stop punishing yourself for having cravings!!  Cigarettes literally change your brain chemistry.  You do not have low will power and you are not weak - your brain is literally producing less acetylcholine because of nicotine.  Good luck!""My friend quit after finding out the girl he was pursuing wouldn't date him because he smoked.

So, he quit cold turkey and tried again.

They've been married for eight years and have two kids.  He hasn't smoked since."I used patches. Been smoke and dip free for 7 months now. "How were they? Before deciding the cold turkey route, I thought of using them but decided that I wanted to quit the consumption of nicotine all together. Was it hard when you went patch free? (assuming you have)""Wanting too, really, but I quit successfully twice (first time for 5 years).   The final time I quit using the patches.  I tapered off on the patches biggest to smallest, and cut the smallest patch in half, then quarters to really draw it out.

 First quit I got the flu and was deliriously sick for three days, and just couldn't smoke.  So I didn't start back up again when I was well enough too a week later.

Honestly though, if you can't quit, at least move to e-cigs."Why would you want to quit? Smoking is awesome! Don't be such a loser."Had an xray that showed a spot on my lung, hacked up blood after I quit which helped me to stay a non-smoker. Ended up being nothing, but still haven't smoked cigarettes since. ""One day, I just had it and I was done. But I couldn't stop obsessing about it. After about 3 days, I was freaking out so bad that I got some nicotine gym. It eased my cravings a bit. I eventually weaned off that after 60 days and switched to regular gum. That was about 9 and a half years ago. Also, at the time, I was watching my mother end her 2 year struggle with lung cancer. She told me, ""I am so happy that you quit. I couldn't!"" She died when I had about 7 months off cigarettes. So... there's that. 
I still think about having one every now and then. But then I think ""Fuck that."" and the feeling goes away.""The most effective way to quit smoking is to ACTUALLY WANT to quit smoking.

I smoked a pack a day for 20 years... Then I decided FOR REAL that I didnt want to smoke anymore.

So I stopped smoking.

The end.

Thats it.

I said I really didnt want to smoke anymore. And I was honest with myself about it. 

Then I stopped smoking.

""Almost like you have to get mad at it, yeah? Saying, ""I'll finish this pack and not buy anymore"" doesn't work. You gotta say ""Fuck you cigarettes!"" and throw half a pack out the window.

Worked for me.. :)""I smoked for 40 years. When I finally decided to quit, (I got a new job in a healthcare setting), I used a hypnosis tape every day, and I used the patch. I think that teaming up those 2 methods was what made me successful.  If I skipped either one, I got cranky and demotivated.
I've been smoke free now for 2+ years, and I couldn't be happier and RICHER!!!!  Every year I get to spend about $2000 at Amazon instead of Marlboro.  That's motivation bitch!
Keep Quitting!  It took me many attempts to be successful.

OH also VERY important!!  I promised myself that I can re-start smoking when I'm 70 years old. Strangely enough knowing that I can have a cigarette in the future, that it's not forever, is very comforting.""Not me, but my mom smoked for +/- 20 years. Got a heart attack, never smoked again after that.""I was a freshman in college and had smoked intermittently throughout high school.  I started smoking more frequently when I moved to a big city and my girlfriend of 2 years came to visit and found the pack in my sock drawer.



The decision was made very quickly.  She turned off the tap until I quit and I went cold turkey.  So lots of coffee and bitching at my roommates for no reason.""It may sound crazy, but getting hypnotized helped my grandparents stop. They both smoked over a pack a day for about 30 years and tried every method to stop. Decided to get hypnotized and haven't had a cigarette since."I quit 8 times until it stuck. You've gotta condition yourself to genuinely hate smoking. "Started Muay Thai, I could feel all the shit gurgling around in my lungs when I was gasping for breath. I stopped smoking for a couple of weeks, noticed that Muay Thai was getting ever so slightly easier and my lungs were ever so slightly less gurgly. The improvements meant that I didn't want to go back no matter what so I stopped being a wimp about things that would normally have made me start smoking again - eg anxiety before job interviews and going out drinking - and just stayed quit. 

Basically I replaced destroying my health with becoming awesome and never looked back.""I woke up from a bad night last Halloween feeling like shit, decided that day was the day and didn't pick up another one. I used an electronic cigarette to curb those extra strong cravings for the first couple weeks. It's only been 3 months, but I really have no desire for one at all anymore. Most of my friends smoke as well as my coworkers, and I don't want to be anywhere near them anymore because they smell awful to me now. Really helps deter me from wanting another. "Also go to the sauna so you can sweat out all the leftover nicotine in your body. This'll make quitting easier. "I myself smoked for about 16 years.  When my wife became pregnant with our first child, I decided it was time to quit as well.  Coincidentally, I also had to travel to Toronto for work for 3 1/2 weeks.  So, I bought a 4 weeks supply of ""the patch"", which was a generic version sold via one of your typical Sam's Club/Costco or whatever and headed off.

In Canada, my brand of cigarettes (starts with an M) was hard to come by, and about twice what you would pay in the US.  Also, the local tobacco tasted horrible compared to US tobacco, which I had experienced from previous visits.  This all helped to discourage me from jumping from the patch while there back into a smoking routine.

That routine lis the key part to getting past the first few weeks.  Break all of your normal habits and do something different.  For me, it was locking myself in the hotel room when I wasn't working or going out for meals.  I spent a lot of time playing Wii games, which kept my hands busy and sustained the physical activity I was used to getting from walking somewhere every 30 minutes for a smoke.  At the end of the day to de-stress, I drank a LOT of awesome Canadian beer.  I guess you could say that the beer was my reward to myself for making it through another day tobacco free.  

When I returned home, it was rough at first as my usual routines would come into play and the habits began to return.  However, since I had made it through the past 4 weeks without a single cigarette, the act of buying and smoking one seemed strange to me.  I just had to get past the waves of tension nicotine withdrawal cause as I stopped using the patch all together.  By then though, my first daughter was born, so I had something new to take my mind off of the cravings, and ended up giving her all of my fee time and attention.

By the way, and I hope this doesn't discourage you, but for me the physical cravings did not go away for about 2 years after I started the patch.  Also, after the first couple of weeks, you will begin to feel like your getting a cold or bad allergies.  I later learned that this is due to all of the new healthy lung tissue which doesn't have that thin layer of tar acting as a protective seal.  It may take a while of getting frequent colds and congestion until your immune system readapts.

Good luck!"Never starting."I quit cold turkey, several times. The last one worked (two years now) because I read about replacing smoking with another habit or ritual. I chose tea, on a schedule, so I had something concrete to look forward to, rather than ""clamp down on the craving every second of the day, and at some nebulous point in the future, it'll be gone entirely."" Instead, ""Oh, boy, tea!"" You could probably get a lab rat to quit smoking the same way.

Also, when I slipped up, which I did a lot at first, I didn't immediately consider the whole endeavour a failure; I just tried harder not to smoke the next time. Not being terrified of failure took a lot of the pressure and stress out of it."/r/electronic_cigaretteITT: bunch of quitters."I think it was a combination of things. 

My son asked me too when he was young and got teary eed and told me he didn't want me to die. That probably pushed me well into the fight.

Also, I read somewhere once that after three days you arent addicted and it is all in our head. I dont think it is true, but I just kept riding out the three days and after that I kept telling myself it wasn't real and I dodn't need it. 

After my first week, my wife quit also, so from there on out we did it together and that really kept me together.

Also, I couldn't afford a pack a day at ten bucks a pack. It just didn't make sense to spend that much.""Throw away the tabacco, and don't buy new.""I think what finally broke me was the fact that I was *going* broke paying 6-7 bucks for a pack of cigarettes.  If I had to tell you what factors actually led to my success, after 3 or 4 failed attempts at quitting, it would be the nicotine gum, then regular gum, then sunflower seeds.  And lots and lots of self control and self discipline.  Good luck, it's not easy!!""I picked a date that meant I wouldn't be around smokers for a good week or so. It was also christmas so no shops were open to sell me tobacco. I cold turkey'd it christmas morning. Didn't really tell anyone I was quitting apart from my mother. Binge ate christmas food, especially chocolates. 36 days and counting.""Ecigs for a few months. I'd still be vaping, but I gave up trying to get the right taste and throat hit, and by that time the regular-cig fixation wore off.""I smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and just walked away.

I think what really worked for me was that I was making a lot of changes at the same time. I moved half way across the country alone to a place I didn't know anyone. I smoked about 4 packs on the drive out and decided when I got there that I didn't want to smoke in the new place. 

Not exactly an easy way to quit for most people. The only time I ever wanted a smoke was after eating mexican food, but that faded after a year or so. haven't even thought about lighting up in the 10 years since I quit.

If you need to light up for a break, use it as a timer. Step outside, light the cigarette and jog around the parking lot instead of smoking it. Technically, you're following the rules.

If you really want to quit, you'll find a way. If I can do it, anyone can.""I used candy cigarettes as real cigarettes, pretending to inhale and all. It worked like a charm.""I looked myself in the mirror all the time and said ""iranianbastard you're no longer a smoker, so you don't need a smoke"" had a few slip ups but I kept counting how many days I was smoke free and I reset, when I reached the 60 day mark I knew there was no turning back. ""Wow though I was in r/stopsmoking until I saw the number of replies.  Cold turkey.  No ecigs. Step outside for a break but walk around the building instead of lighting up. Ecigs keep you relying on a bad habit, instead, replace it with a healthy activity :)""Not me, but my stepdad has been clean for 15 years because of this. He cut a straw in the length of a cigarette and constantly held, and put it in his mouth as if it were a cigarette. He would chew on it all the time too. He said this tricked his body into thinking it was getting his cigarette fix, while also getting him off nicotine. I'm sure that doesn't work for everyone. But it did for him. "The picture of the drapes in the bath on here made me quit. Cold turkey. It's been over a year.Easy. I was in between jobs and couldn't afford to buy cigarettes anymore. "I have since started again(after 2 years) but I still believe this is relevant. Part of what is hard about quitting is the fear of it being worth nothing, that you'll just start again. When I quit for 2 years.  It was a week before a devastating breakup and a week and a half before a suicide of a very good friend.  

Rather than allow stress to bring you in, remind yourself this is still something you can overcome, and moreso that life can not make you start again regardless of what it throws at you. Essentially I quit during a very very stressful and devastating month but stuck to it.  I felt prepared for anything. 

For those wondering, I started again for no real reason.  I would smoke occasionally while drinking. Which worked fine for a year but caught up with me and I started drinking and decided I'd rather just smoke again, quit later, rather than lie myself into alcoholism on top of smoking. 

Moving this weekend and I will be considering my new property a non-smoking property so bracing myself for fist pounding torture again. ""take a puff of your cig, put a white napkin over your mouth, exhale, inspect napkin."I smoked since the age of 15 and was a pack a day by 16 for about 8 years. To me the only way I know people who have been successful and how I did it was cold turkey. You have to have the self will and motivation to force yourself to stop. Don't make excuses don't say well just one every now and then won't hurt because if you do you aren't going to quit. Its a matter of self will. Once you stop for a couple days you will get more confident. After a few weeks you will start to feel better and have more energy and breathe better. Then your at a month your first huge mile mark. Don't look at it as a time table though. Take it day by day and moment by moment. Resisting when you want one the most is the best way to build up your will and the confidence to quit. Believe in your self. Your brain is stronger than any chemical and you have the will and strength to quit. Cold turkey. Just quit. Tell yourself you don't smoke anymore. Don't count days. Don't replace one addiction with another. You're done. Non smokers don't do things like that and once you tell yourself you're a non smoker you'll do the same. "My dad quit smoking by just going cold turkey. I'm not sure how, but he just said ""I'm quitting, it's bad for you and I'm getting older"" and just... stopped. Didn't have any method of doing it, he just did.""I managed to quit 2.5 packs-a-day of nonfilter Camels without suffering.

Every smoker knows the feeling of the 'nicotine nag', the mechanism that tells us to light up, to make sure we have cigarettes before we leave the house, make sure there are matches or a lighter, make sure the lighter has enough fuel, and when to take the next drag.

Every smoker also knows that slightly sick feeling you get when you light up too soon, and have to put out that cigarette. The sick feeling fades, and for minutes more the nicotine nag stays silent, but we'll hear from it soon enough.

That slightly-sick feeling holds the trick to breaking the habit.

You will need several weeks' worth of full-strength (21 mg) nicotine patches, plus scissors and a pencil.

Put on enough full-strength nicotine patches, not just to silence the nicotine nag, but to induce that faint feeling of too-much-too-fast, just to get to the edge of it, feeling a tiny bit sick, enough you can tell, but not enough to worry you. At that point you know you're not going to get sicker because you're not adding more patches, and you are not going to hear a peep from the nicotine nag. That slightly-ill feeling is now your very best friend.

Tally the number of patches because that's now your daily schedule. (It took 2.75 patches of 21 mg strength for me my first day.) At bedtime, take off the patches. After your morning shower, put on the scheduled number of patches.

Now that the nicotine nag has been silenced, start laundering all your clothes and bedding, wash down walls, doors, and windows. Clean furniture and carpets. Clean the inside of your car.

It will take a few days for all the stink to be gone from your sinuses.

Next week's schedule is nine-tenths of this week's. And so on and so on, week after week, knocking it down ten percent each week.

Mathematically, you will never finish. Practically, you will realize one day that you haven't patched up the last several mornings, so you had already kicked the habit and didn't notice.""This is going to be longer, so please note the TL;DR in the bottom. Also, I am not native english speaking, so please excuse any mistakes. Here's my story:

I started smoking when I was around 14 years old. Soon after, I capped out at around a pack a day and went on like that for 12 years. My closest friends were also smoking and most of them still are. During these 12 years I undertook several attempts to quit, but never really managed much longer than 3 consecutive months until I started again. Most of these attempts were based on willpower to fight the urge of smoking a cigarette. Patches, chewing gums etc as my ""weapons"". A fight that I and most people will eventually lose.
Then, three years ago I finally started to see smoking for what it is and I stopped from one day to the next and never had to fight any urge, never went ""cold turkey"", didn't get aggressive or any of the usual side effects of stopping.

Here are the insights that I gained that changed the way I think about smoking today. They helped me in getting away from it and may help you as well:

* First, I realized that an argument used by most smokers (including me) is that smoking helps when you are stressed. It's calming and soothes the mind.. or so I thought. But if that was the case, how do non smokers manage their stress? They should be stressed like hell with no way to calm their nerves. So I asked myself: ""before I started smoking, was I more stressed than I am now?"" The answer was simply ""no"". Then I asked myself: ""After I started smoking, did I get stressed more often?"" and here the answer was ""yes"". So I realized that it was not everyday life stress that I soothed by smoking, but it was the stress induced BY smoking that I had to soothe WITH smoking. A viscious circle that would only end if I stopped smoking.

* Following the above realization I concluded that the cigarette was not a friend in tough times, but rather a little devil that once let loose manifests itself in ones head and keeps telling you that life is stressy as hell and you can only reduce it by feeding on cigarettes. And each time I feed that little devil, it allows me to feel for a short time as I once did as a non-smoker.. for a short time, until it tells me it's time again to pay (or smoke) the toll..

* I realized that there was only one way out. A pretty easy way actually; stop smoking and get rid of that little devil. Quitting smoking would not mean that I'd have to give up the company of a good companion and constantly think about wanting it back, but rather would I finally be able to get rid of that little devil in my head and forget about it forever. I compare it now to a situation of having a relative pass away; we all have relatives that we like and others that we (really) dislike. Now if the one I like dies, I might miss that person for a long time, if not forever. However, if the one that I dislike passes away, I won't waste two thought about him or her, hell, I might even be happy about it.

And that is how I see it today, I am happy that I don't have to run after my cigarettes anymore, that feeling in the evening of having only one left, debating whether to smoke it now or tomorrow morning. Going out late at night to run down to the store and get a pack because I cannot bear the thought of having no cigarettes left. All these things, gone, and I couldn't be happier. Why would I miss that? Why would anyone?

And each day that I don't feed the little devil, it gets weaker and more silent. From time to time it shows itself for a second or two, but fades away quickly again.

And am I more stressed now than when I was still smoking? No, I am as stressed as I was before I ever started. As stressed as any non-smoker is.

TL;DR: 

* Smoking doesn't make you more relaxed than a non-smoker is. It makes you AS relaxed as a non-smoker, but only for a short time.

* The cigarette is not your friend that you have to miss. It's that little devil you once let loose and have been a slave to ever since. Be happy to get rid of it. You don't ""give up"" smoking, you ""stop"" smoking. There's really nothing to give up, you only gain from stopping.

* When you are around smokers, don't envy them (there really is nothing to be envious of), instead pitty them for still being slaves to that little devil (don't tell them though ;)

I really hope this might help some of you to get rid of that burden. I enjoy everyday being without it and don't miss any of it.

Cheers,
Oxidan

edit: formatting""Wanting to quit.

Not kidding, 'tried' to quit twice before, but I didn't actually want to, I enjoyed it, made me more social, and made me feel like I wasn't as stressed, so I went back to smoking before too long. Second time I even tried an e-cig, didn't much care for it just because I couldn't find a single juice/mixture that actually tasted like a real cig (and I fucking love the taste, weird I know).

But, in about 8 hours it will have been 104 days since my last smoke. And only because I didn't want to. I felt like quitting so i quit. Every now and then, especially when dealing with idiots at work (and there are plenty) I think to myself ""man, I wouldn't mind a smoke right now"" but that's all it is. I don't even know if I can call it a craving, more of a 'meh why not' sort of thing.

Some people react differently, I'd say most do, but like I said, I wanted to quit so I did, and some people will hate me for saying this or call me a liar because it definitely isn't true for most people it seems, but it wasn't hard. I haven't had an actual craving (like I used to have when it had been 2 hours since my last smoke), or anything. Went from a little over a pack a day to 0 at the drop of a hat.

My main advice is to find out how to make yourself want to quit. And I don't mean in a ""well it is better for my health so I **should**"" or ""I could save a lot of money so I **should**"" kind of way. I mean you **WANT** to quit. If you don't want to quit you won't, you may go 4-5 or even 10 years without smoking but you'll go back because: ""it wasn't so bad, it helped me a lot with____ . besides I only quit because___ .""


Want to do it, then do it.""Totally, TOTally agree. I tried many times unsuccessfully (obviously) but I simply loved to smoke. I liked the ceremony of it, the chatting with other smokers, the break taking, opening a new pack, etc. But at some point, it just didn't feel so great anymore and I didn't want to. Just like you, I just stopped and it wasn't hard. Going on 6 months. Not an official non-smoker yet but that book has definitely closed. Oh and the Quit It Pro App was cool the first couple of weeks.""E-cigarettes are super for helping you wean off. You just have to be disciplined. After the first 2 or 3 days of only vaping, you'll becoming super sensitive to the odor/taste of cigarettes and they'll actually gross you out. I still smoke occasionally, usually when I drink or party, but I gross myself out when I do and I usually can't even finish a whole cigarette in one shot. 
Maybe try to limit yourself to 3 cigarettes a day (morning, lunch, evening) with the e-cig for a few days, then down to 2, then down to 1. Eventually you'l realize that you don't even necessarily *want* to smoke, you just do it out of habit. Once you;ve realized that, you take note that it has become something you do just because you do it, and it's far easier to tell yourself that you *don't* want to do it anymore and you can stop altogether. E-ciigs are alsoe great because they help you avoid the shitty on-edge phase after you quit, and you can slowly reduce the nicotine amount in them until you're just vaping flavour :) 
Also, for the break thing, I think that if you're allowed to go out for a cigarette, your boss will let you go out for 2 or 3 minutes to breathe fresh air and center yourself. Because that's all you're really doing when you take a smoke break anyways, isn't it? Just a few minutes to yourself to escape from the hectic workplace. You can do the same without cigarettes by taking full deep breaths and reconnecting with your inner calm. 
Good luck barbiesarthritis! It's not impossibruh, you can do it! :)""Nicorette worked for me. I went from a pack a day to chewing a lot of nicotine gum. The directions tell you certain amounts for only so long, but I just needed something to occupy me. So I'd start a piece and chew it until my jaw hurt (2-3 hours), take a 15 minute break and then start chewing a new piece. After a couple weeks and slowly cutting down, I switched to regular gum, and eventually stopped that. 3 years later, still no cigarettes. If I get a bad craving (rarely, and only when drinking) I'll buy a nice cigar and smoke that instead."If gave myself a full year to phase myself out. I went cold turkey right off the bat. Then I would only smoke on the weekends and then not at all. The hardest part of not smoking was while I was drinking.......so I switched to weed and everything was fine."Cold Turkey. The first couple of weeks were complete hell, but you get through it and it gets easier and easier.""This isn't encouraging, but here it goes:

I'm not a smoker, but my Dad was for decades. He was finally able to kick the habit when he went through major surgery and was bed ridden for weeks. During that time, his wife, my step-mother, told him that she would leave him if he lived through the surgery and picked up smoking again. Ultimately that motivation coupled with the fact he was confined to a bed was the combination that worked for him. ""I smoked a pack and a half a day for 15 years.
I successfully quit 5 months ago using nicotine replacement.
I used 4 mg patches and 2 mg gum for the first two weeks.
I used 2 mg gum for the second two weeks.
I've done a shitload of pushups since."Fear of dying young. I quit 3 years ago."Nicotine patches worked for me. Helps to break the habit of smoking cigarettes before you then break the actual nicotine addiction. But it would be totally useless you truly, truly want to stop.""Get a better e-cig.  Seriously.  I smoked for 14 years, used an e-cig for about 4 getting more and more involved into the culture.  You also need a real kit, none of that gas station garbage.  The only thing worth trying at a gas station would be an Njoy King.  They're expensive and disposable, but probably the closest thing to the real deal.  After going through a variety of kits, I was finally able to cut off regular cigarettes entirely using a Joyetech E-Roll and Halo's HX3 e-juice.  It helped that the e-roll is the same size as a cig and comes with a case that charges the unit without taking it apart.  Bust it out, take a few drags for 5-10 minutes, put it back and it's fully charged for the next ""cig break.""  Once I started using it like a cigarette, during step outside cig breaks and all that, the transition was almost seamless.  One day I didn't want a cigarette.  I still don't.  Almost 8 months now.

*Edit: I still vape.  No intention to quit that at all.  Shoutout to /r/electronic_cigarette"E-cigs get me my beloved nicotine while letting me not smell like a smoker.  :D"Quitting is easy. Bear with me. Usually it goes as many users before me said: one day you just stop and don't look back. Every other method (patches, gum, electronic cigar) will fail sooner or later. What they don't tell you is that the real fight starts in the next hours after you quit smoking and it will last your whole life. You'll need to have a lot of self control so you can say no whenever you're sad or mad and you think a cigar will calm you down, whenever you go out with your friends and they smoke around you, whenever you feel bored and you think a cigar will help you pass the time. In the first year at least you will be craving a smoke more than ever, but as the time goes by it will be much easier to just say no. I've quit 3-4 times before finally quitting 8 years ago and there are still times when I think a cigar would be good. But I just remember myself how long has been since I quit smoking, how bad I smelled and how bad it is for my health. And it works. At least for me.""Being told I had cancer, got the news went outside to think, smoked a cigarette, then thought *what the hell am I doing?*"Moved to using an electronic cigarette with nicotine juice.. Really easy to quit smoking cigarettes but I am definitely consuming more nicotine now. "Nicotine Patches work like a charm. I started with the strongest one and second day on my was home from work I found one cigarette in my car. Naturally I decided that I should smoke it. Big mistake, because patches have lot of nicotine I got light headed and had to stop on the side of the road for about 10-15min. After that I simply didn't want to smoke anymore... I have to admit that after 3 years of not smoking I did started smoking again.  

P.S. My father also quit smoking with the help of patches. At the time he was a smoker for about 35 years. 10 years later he is still smoke free ... ""I think regardless of what methods you try to use or incorporate into your plan, you have to genuinely want to quit. You can't want to do it for anyone but yourself. Pick a day and stick to it. Probably the hardest part is keeping perspective and remembering just because you may have a slip, trip or fall every once in a while, don't abandon ship because of one misstep. As for me, I took Wellburtin and it worked for me, but may not have similar results for you (^* ^results ^not ^typical ). What I really liked about that approach is Wellbutrin doesn't just help with smoking, but with many things you do compulsively. Bottom line, everyone tells you how hard it is and it is, but really, you are the one that makes the final determination as to how difficult this will be.""I will say this.  Cold Turkey worked for both me.  I've been quit for one year and three days.  This is my third quit.  This is the quit that is for good.  It's hard for three weeks.  It's as simple as having your moment saying, ""I'm done.""  It's easy to say but hard to do.  It's hard for about three weeks.

I say this.  Embrace the quit.  Embrace the feeling around it.  Know that the pain you're going though now with the withdrawal will lead to something better and just never smoke another one.  Ever.

One year and three days later, I've lost 40 pounds and I'm running my first ever half-marathon on a trail next month.  A trail-half marathon! Started running 6 months ago and average 25 miles per week.

I'm 42 years old and I'm in the best shape of my life.  I sound like a bow-flex commercial."E-Cigarettes"I smoked for 18 yrs . I tried e-cigs that did not  work . I was not addicted to the nicotine it was the oral fixation. I was dating a girl at the time who hated smokers and the smell. She would bitch NON STOP . So i would never smoke around her at all. If i drank i would smoke one or two. After a while I didnt need to smoke at all when i was drunk. Now came the hard part quitting flat out. So i bought boxes IceBreaker mints an every time i had an urge sitting in traffic I would pop a mint open the window put my hand outside the window and the urge would go away. 
So the key to me being smoke free now for 2 yrs is get an annoying as fuck girlfriend who wont stop bitching and some mints. 
(the gf is no longer around and I am still a non smoker)""I wanted to quit and I tried to quit so many times, by so many means. I would always tell people that I had quit, in the hopes that the fear of the shame of failing would prevent me from failing. That never worked. I just got better at being sneaky. It wasn't until I truly decided that I didn't want people to know I had failed because I actually didn't want to fail, that I found it disgusting myself. Finally, I was ashamed of myself for smoking. Then, it was easy. ""I quit smoking last year in September as I caught a lung infection and couldn't breath. I was put on a nebulizer and inhaler because my lungs were so bad. Another 24 hours later I would have ended up in hospital. My doc told to take a good look as if I continued smoking I would end up on the nebulizer within 3 years. Thing was I was a 5 a day smoker. Didn't smoke by day if the kids were around I only smoked at night outside the house when they were in bed. That was the turning point for me, haven't smoked since then.""For me it was ecigs. It turned into somewhat of a hobby for me since I love to tinker with things. I guess it's not really the same as completely quitting, but I haven't had a cigarette in about 9 months.""I have been going cold turkey for 2 weeks, the first week sucks but once you get through it it gets better and you start to feel A LOT better. The trick is knowing what and when your triggers are and how to manage them. For me driving, being at work or drinking alcohol, coffee or eating amongst others. Also I found that deep slow heavy breathing when you are craving hard really helps, you start to re teach your brain that clean air is better and more relaxing than a nasty cigarette. Good luck!"Thought a $1.25 was to much to pay for a pack "2 years smoke free.. Smoked almost 20 years.. Tried drugs, gums and patches... 

The only thing that honestly worked was my desire to just stop and not do it anymore.. Nothing will work if you don't want to do it.. It was hell for the first month or so but it got easier.. 
Good luck!! You will thank yourself once you separate yourself from the slavery of nicotine. ""Don't listen to all these people suggesting e cigs.  It really doesn't help.  Everyone I know who tried it always ended up back smoking regulars, my self included.  The reason for this is that you are not solving the problem with e cigs.  You are still smoking, be it with a placebo.  The key is to kill the habit.  It generally takes the body about a month to get used to something new (ie, new diet, exercise, quit smoking).  My suggestion to you is to sit down and really think about why you want to quit.  Have a real heart to heart with your self.  Decide that you want to quit, I mean really want to quit.  You have to want to quit more than you want a cigarette.  Once you are in that frame of mind, you quit.  It wont be easy, but if you have truly resolved your self to quit, then you can do it.  I did it cold turkey after being a pack a day guy for 5 years.  You just have to want to quit more than you want that cigarette.""Caring about what I do, following my dreams, making the wise moves in my life to position me for happiness, and surrounding myself with people I genuinely like.""I smoked pretty steadily for just under 10 years. The first time I quit was about 5 years in. I used nicotine patches and managed to quit for about 6 months. I'd have the occasional drunken / social cigarette, but I considered myself to have quit. Eventually those lapses started adding up and I was smoking leftover packs from a night out. 

The second time I quit was about 2 years later. I think it was a new years resolution. I went cold turkey that time. Rinse and repeat the paragraph above, and you know how that turned out.

I finally quit about  2 years (hopefully going on forever) ago. I had an upswing in my depression and decided to get in shape and set the goal of completing a Warrior Dash (one of those obstacle 5ks). To accomplish this I started running and signed up for a fitness bootcamp. In addition to smokers' lungs, I have some mild asthmatic  symptoms as well, and I just couldn't keep up with the running as I was. But I was so enamored of this idea of reshaping my body and my life that I just knew I could quit-- so I did. Cold Turkey. 

In retrospect I think I may have replaced the addiction of smoking with the addiction to improving my distance and speed when running. Like you, work was a *major* trigger for me. At the time I worked overnights, at a job that bored me to death, largely by myself with a fair amount of down time, and the option of smoking inside my workplace. It was a recipe for temptation. But instead of smoking I'd plan to hit the gym after work and thinking about that kept me on the wagon.

In the 2 years since, I unfortunately haven't kept up with the fitness as much as I'd like, but I have met a wonderful woman who's now my partner. She'd never demand that I not smoke, but she loves me and cares about my health. Having someone to share my life with makes me care that much more about my own health, and now I don't think I could ever smoke again. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you have to become a marathoner, or find the love of your life to quit smoking. Those aren't reasonable achievements for everyone, and are pretty conditional on your situation in life. But what you definitely *can* do is find *something* in your life that you're passionate about. Something that's so important to you that it gives your life additional value. Think about how illness or incapacitation  because of your habit might prevent you from enjoying this thing to the fullest, or even shorten the amount of time you have left to enjoy it. That's what really helped me quit.

tl;dr: find something so important to you that you're unwilling to endanger it by continuing to smoke.""Well when my new gf, who I was really into but whom I did not smoke around found out she told me she didn't date smokers.  We are married now so you can guess how that went.""Getting cancer at 26. The best time to quit is right now, friend.""Maybe I'm not the best person to give advice considering I started smoking again a year after I quit.... but as others have said, you have to really, truly want it.""I found that I just had to stop thinking about it to stay quit. Stop thinking ""I'm in the car-time for a smoke"", ""It's breaktime-time for a smoke"" ""Theres a convenience store-time to buy cigarettes"". Once you begin to see these as thoughts, accept them as OK and let them go without acting on them eventually they stop happening. "not being able to afford themI switched to an e - cig and never looked back. It tastes better and can be a hobby."I used Chantix awesome stuff. After about a week of taking you pretty much forget about your normal cigarette. Like driving, I got all the way to work, got out of my car and felt like I was forgetting something. The only side effect for me was very vivid dreams, before Chantix my dreams were black and white on an old tube tv, while taking Chantix dreams were like watching 1080P on an LED TV just unreal. And a must is eat something when you take it.""I finally really wanted to. My wife was pregnant, and I didn't want my kids to grow up around smoking like I did. Before that I was always attempting to quit for self improvement, and I always ended up deciding I wanted to have a cigarette now instead of living longer into my 60s. Tying it to the well being of my kid flipped a different switch. Don't go getting someone or yourself pregnant to quit smoking though.

As far as technique? Cold turkey. From a pack a day to nothing. The first week is a bitch, but if you really want it you can do it. Truth is that you're likely to crave a cigarette now and again for the rest of your life, because the chemical addiction is only a portion of it. For me, the memory of lighting up and drawing that first puff of a cigarette into my lungs feels pretty fantastic."CASH!!! Not sure if anyone said this yet.  Make a bet with someone else who is trying to quit to see who can quit the longest.  Make it a large amount of money you don't want to part with.  "I was never that much of a smoker but I could smoke 30 in a night out and I increasingly started smoking more and more. While I started only smoking when I drank, I noticed that I was buying packets whenever I was going on a drive, or having a break in college. 
I wanted to quit for ages. I started smoking a lighter brand (Malbro to SilkCut Silver and sometimes menthol) to ween myself of the amount of nicotine I was getting. I did this for a good six months. I thought I'd never get the courage to actually give up entirely until one faithful Halloween, I spent the night in an enclosed room with six other smokes. I woke up the next morning, took a good look at myself and vowed to never smoke again. 
I threw away my cigs and spent three months avoiding anyone I used to smoke with and anywhere I smoked (cafes, pubs etc.) I cleaned out any evidence of smoking in my car and just pretended I never took it up. I knew if I could go three months cold turkey, I would beat the craving. After those three months, I started testing myself. Hanging out with smokers, going to bars and cafes that I used to smoke in. I knew I had beaten the beast after that. That was the 1st of November 2011. I never smoked again. It was the best decision I have ever made and one of the very few things I am 100% proud of. I would recommend it to anyone who smokes. It's disgusting to me now.  ""Also, apps that track your progress are extremely helpful. ""I have a reason for quitting that most find peculiar, but seems totally feasible to me. Simply put, I want to live forever. I feel that with all the advances in the past 100 years, both with science and technology, that it is perfectly reasonable to believe that ""they"" will either cure death, or at the very least slow or reverse the aging process. And it would suck to die of lung diseases before that happens. 
It also helps to have a super awesome non-smoking SO that is way more important than smoking. 
TL:DR - cold turkey, live forever. You gotta want it. ""I consciously decided to simply quit inhaling and treat it like a cigar and I had no real cravings while doing this. I didn't even plan to stop smoking, I just wanted to be healthier about it but I found myself needing to go smoke less and eventually noticed it had been days since my last smoke so I just didn't do it anymore.""Pack a day for like 15 years. I used nicotine gum. 6 years later, i'm smoke free but i'm still chewing the gum. At the end of the day,  It's healthier and cheaper than smoking.... I may have to smoke to get off the gum.  "A single psilocybin trip rid me of my pack-a-day habit that I held for years before"Smoked from the time I was about 12 until I was 22. Just turned 28 haven't had a smoke since. Quit while I lived in a house full of people drinking and smoking all the time. It's a cliche but you have to want to quit. You can't be fantasizing about smokes all the time. A buddy of mine said ""you have to be hypocritical, you have to hate smoking even though you loved it yesterday"". I convinced myself I hated the smell. Now I couldn't have a smoke if you paid me. ""For me it was the realization that smoking itself makes you feel like shit, and you only THINK you get a buzz/pleasant feelings. Basically, the moment from the initial craving, up until you light one up and take that first drag is all satisfying, but it's all downhill after that. After you're done with the cigarette, your body feels way worse. The only satisfaction is the psychological one, that you had a craving and satisfied it.
""This will probably get buried but...

On New Years Eve, 2010, I smoked a pack of menthols and a pack of cloves. It made me so sick that I was tasting the cloves well into the next week and ever since then I haven't been able to smoke cigs or even be around them. 

I did pick up a pretty heavy marijuana smoking ""addiction"" thought."Determination worked for me"Wanting to quit was a huge part of my equation. Much like an engine won't run without gas, you won't quit without the genuine desire to do so. I'd estimate having tried to quit no less than a dozen times...ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months but always faltering and going back to smoking.

That being said, find support through a friend/acquaintance who also wishes to quit. Make a $100 no bullshit bet. Thirty days, no smoking. The first one to smoke loses and pays up. And if you have any honor whatsoever, know that you'll pay up if you lose.

At the end of my 30 days, I was well on my way to having quit. I even found out much later on that I actually won the bet, but was so thrilled with having quit smoking that I didn't even care enough to collect. 

Good luck!

It's been 13 years as of today, still smoke free and happy as hell to be rid of that shit.""Cold turkey. I finally had enough with the morning hack, the smell and the taste. I finished my last pack almost resentfully and never looked back. A few times I wanted to get a pack I didn't, and it's been over a year since I had a smokey treat. I decided it was enough.""Weed, smoke weed evry time you want a cig. You only need to smoke a little bowl to get high rather than a whole cig. First day i did this i did not smoke any cigs. Never even had the urge either. After a month it was like magic i had not smoked any cigs and did not feel much of the side effects. Then i just slowly cut down on smoking weed which is alot easier to quit. And in two months i stopped smoking completely with minimal stress.


Used to be a chain smoker for 3 years pack a day kind of seal.""I liked to think that I only smoked socially and wasn't addicted but when I tried quitting I realized I was. I was able to quit while working a boring job in retail that gave me plenty of time to smoke or do something else. What worked for me was lack of funds. For a week or so, I had no money to do anything including buy cigars or cigarettes. After a while I lost track of the last time I had one. "ITT: Wanting to quit. That or e-cigarettes.

And yeah its forbidden to smoke while you work at my workplace. But couple of years ago i worked at a resturant and i loved getting those extra breakes because i smoked. ""I just hit my 8 months quitaversary on the 22nd - and I did it cold turkey.  Ever since then I've made it a goal to take at least a few minutes to tell potential quitters how I approached the problem and then dealt with it (and quite successfully so far).

Part of it had to do with the events going on in my life, part of it had to do with *following through with my own quit rules*.

Background: I was not a long-term smoker.  I'm sure this makes some difference but that difference was not enough to keep me quit the first, the second, third, fourth, on and on and on x100000 times I attempted to quit before May last year.  It is still the most difficult thing I have ever accomplished in my life.

How'd I do it?

--Well, I actually wanted to quit deep down.  Basically, each failed attempt at quitting (gum, lozenges, e-cig, etc) was another stepping stone for me to use towards that desire to quit

--Then I found this site: http://whyquit.com.  This guy is great.  Not because he's unintentionally hilarious (my god, those teeth...), but because he lays it down cold-fucking-blooded, factually, and rather abrasively that You, Sir or Madam, are a fucking *addict* - you're right there with the rest of them and, in a lot of cases, more strongly addicted.  So the road is going to be rough and rocky.  And this is where I'd usually stop before making my new attempt.  Except this time...

--I decided to swap the idea of quitting *cigarettes* with the more accurate goal of quitting my ADDICTION to cigarettes.  Because by god it certainly wasn't the flavor or image appeal that got me hooked to cigarettes.  Nicotine got me.

--I intensely studied up on timelines for quitters.  Know where you are in the process and what *may* be in store for you at 5 days quit, 2 weeks, etc etc.

--Write all of this shit down!  Tape it somewhere where you can see it every day when you wake up.  It doesn't matter if you actually look at it daily... It's the act of displaying it that's important.

--Write down a list of all of the most attractive, wonderful, and freeing qualities of someone who is a nonsmoker.  Yea, that could be you.  Sexy, isn't it?  Look, remember, think about this list when you get a craving.  You're a nonsmoker?  I'm no statistician but I'd say your chances of gettin booty are unbelievably higher than those of a smoker.

--Come up with *small* things that you can do to keep your hands busy when you get a craving.  The more pleasure you get from doing it (publicly acceptable things, mind you), the better the thing is.  Me? I started playing Candy Crush, chewing toothpicks when I found them, and *flipping the pages of a book*.  Yea.  Some of you know what I'm talking about; that small wave of oooooohhhh yeeeeaaaa when you thumb a thick book's pages real quick... Whatever works.

--The rewards system.  You'll want to do this.  It just feels great when you start noticing all the money you're saving.  Now, for me it wasn't immediate because I ended up supplementing the extra cash with extra things that I was already buying, like gas, food, and necessities, but you can use it whichever way you want.  When I hit my one year anniversary I'm buying myself a new guitar.  But not only is that a great goal to have, it's a great feeling knowing that *I have literally been able to pay off several large, outstanding bills now that I've quit smoking*.  THAT, fellow reddebtors, is an amaaaaazing feeling.

Sorry for the lengthy reply but maybe you or someone else will read it and gain a piece of info that helps in the process.  That's worth the amount of time it took to type this on my phone *any* day.

There is one final piece of advice that I need to share.  It's from that website I posted and it is still probably the most crucial piece of advice in the bag when it comes to me *staying* quit.  This hurt a little bit the first time but I feel like it's true:

You will *always* be a nicotine addict.  There's no off switch.  There's only ""I have quit.""  What that means for you, what it still means to me, is that you are and always will be on a knife's edge.  Sometimes, 10 years later, you'll still get a random craving.  And just like you would never give ""Just a taste"" of wine to a recovering alcoholic, so must you treat yourself from now on.  That ""just a drag"" at your best friend's bachelor party?  The quick puff of your friend's cig outside of Denny's after a meal?  Those small hits of nicotine will reset your entire quitting process to day one.  But you can do it.  I did it in the midst of stressing out over not knowing if a baby was actually mine, going through the court process for a charge from years ago I was still dealing with, AND receiving a promotion to management where I work.  I needed all of the cigarettes!  But I got through it and it got better.

Everything smelled a lot better too :)

Good luck!""My friend is an amateur boxer so he runs a lot for his training. I thought it looked fun and decided to join him and since then I've ran several 5k's and generally run a few times a week, I smoked for 8 years and since that day I went running with my friend, I decided I never wanted to smoke again. February 5th will make two years since I've quit and I couldn't be happier.""Just did it. Sorry, I don't have better advice. It's the only thing that worked for me. I've been off it for four years now :)""I smoked for 7 years from 1996 to 2003.

I tried quitting 3 or 4 times prior but always gave back in when I'd drink.

I finally just got so disgusted with myself every single time I smoked that I reached a tipping point where I couldn't stomach the thought of it but knew I'd just give in again when I drank. 

I was discussing my desires to quit smoking with a buddy of mine at work and after listening for a bit he said something that is so ""duh"" obvious but for some reason really sank in. He said something along the lines of ""no one controls what you do but you, if you want to quit, no one is going to make you, you have to decide for yourself and stick to it""

Silly right? But for whatever reason what he said combined with the disgust I felt ever time I did smoke finally did the trick.

So, I decided to quit cold turkey both smoking and drinking.

I never again had another smoke after that and didn't have a single drink for a full year. After 1 full year then I eased back into have a beer here and there and found that I didn't care to binge drink on the weekends like I had the years prior and never drank at the same levels since then either. ""I quit by chewing the heck out of Nicorette and eating Ritz crackers. That caused a different set of problems, but I've been smoke-free since 1997.""I took a week off and visited my family that I was embarrassed to smoke around. I wanted to play with my niece and nephew without having to worry about it. I grabbed some nicotine lozenges and knuckled through. It was surprisingly easy in a stress-free environment. I stopped the lozenges as soon as I got back and kept track of my cravings with an app. Hardly think about it anymore!

You have to want to quit for yourself. Not because someone else wants you to. ""When my mom quit smoking, she put a bunch of cigarette buts in a bottle with water and kept it under the sink. Every time she wanted to smoke, she'd open the bottle and smelled it. It was so putrid, it would make her not want a cigarette anymore. ""One day I realized that I smoked a ton in my car because I was bored.  My biggest hurdle was to get used to not smoking in my car so that I would be used to being bored without lighting up.  After that, it was fairly easy to stop although I did swear off drinking for a few months (because I would also smoke a lot more when I was drinking).  Hope this helps.""A couple things:

Ecigs totally work, the only catch being you need a good quality ecig.

Part of smoking is you're conditioned to smoke at certain times and in certain situations. Some people smoke everytime they drive, or after sex, or after dinner, or when the wake up. When you quit these times are when you're going to get the worst cravings. If you can break the cycle and not indulge at these times then when you quit you wont get intense cravings at these times and it'll ultimately make your life a lot easier.

If you have a significant other, have them help you. They don't need to yell at you when you slip up (that'll just make things difficult between you two) but rather have them give you encouragement, if you can't quit for yourself quit for them. I can talk myself into indulging, but when my gf tells me it breaks her heart to see me smoke, it makes me want to quit.

also, just remember, you *can* do it. It feels impossible sometimes, but remember, people before you have done it, and you can do it too.""First post, hoping I can help someone.

I loved smoking. Loved it. Up until my late 20's, I had no desire whatsoever to stop, and doubted I would be able to when the time came anyway. I was weak in that I could not go cold turkey - I simply wasn't strong enough. Everything I did - every gathering, every trip, every errand, my budget - was planned with smoking at the forefront of my mind. I started and ended my days smoking in bed.

What actually got me to make a serious attempt at quitting was seeing a really disturbing image. I was waiting to get my hair cut, picked up a Time magazine, and inside saw a picture of a 35-year-old with advanced lung cancer. He had wasted away, I'm guessing to less than 100 pounds. His skin was like grayish beige paper stretched over bones, mouth hanging open, sunken cheeks and eye sockets, looking very much like an ancient Egyptian mummy. However, what really got to me was his spouse - sitting on a chair next to the bed and staring with an expression of profound sadness. I was 30 at the time, and thinking ""this could be ME in a couple years. I thought I had more time!""

There are several parts to a cigarette addiction - the nicotine and the physical fingers/mouth/smoke thing. I knew I couldn't beat all of it at once, so I used nicorette. The thing is, the gum doesn't work very well if you follow the instructions and park it on the side of your mouth. Most of the nasty stuff just ends up running down your throat, making you gag. I failed my first attempt, then discovered that the key is to park it like dip - alternating between the upper and lower lip.

I also drank an enormous amount of beer for the first few weeks, which seems counterintuitive because the two are always so connected, but it kept me busy. I also continued to use the gum for far longer than recommended, about 10 months, gradually reducing the amount until I would keep the same piece in my lip all day long. I could still taste the bitterness at the end of the day, which after 16 hours was probably an almost immeasurably small amount of nicotine, but I had beaten the fingers/smoke habit so long ago that when I finally quit the gum it was a non-event. I believe that this extremely gradual reduction in addictive behavior is the reason I was so successful. To this day I can hang out with smokers without being bothered by the smell, and drink without cravings.

Source: I smoked 1-2+ packs/day for 14 years. My last drag was on July 31, 1999.""I quit because I was always sick with bronchitis & had asthma attacks daily.  I used Nicorette gum & quit successfully.  I had tried Nicorette when it first came out (available by prescription) & the taste was awful, but they have made great improvements to the flavor - it's like regular gum.  Good luck to anyone trying to quit.""I quit cold for about a year and then found myself surrounded by some smokers at a party.  Had one and was buying again the next day.  Did a little research and bought some e-cigarette stuff.  Found myself with the same group that got me started again about a 10 months later.  Could not stand to be near real cigarette smoke.  I get headaches around them now.

As for the e-cig, I'm using it less and less.  Will probably run through the juice I have left and give it away.""a few things. I had some nicotine gum I'd rarely uses, but I was unemployed and broke. Granted I could of scrounged up enough money for a pack of smokes. Honestly the other thing that helped me is I just binged on Civilization IV for 2 or 3 days straight. Honestly when you're so fixated on a game it sometimes won't crave nicotine.

""[Not](http://lifehacker.com/5724711/how-to-break-bad-habits) an ex-smoker, but an 'addicted' procrastinator. Your brain is lazy and wants to standardize behavior patterns. Fat people for example, the second they sit in the chair they always eat chips in, get triggered to want to eat chips. Their brain unleashes it's growing force upon that person, for which after every time they give in, it get's harder and harder to not eat chips. Instead of giving in to the force with cigarettes, give it something else: like an apple or something that you continiously and often use to condition the brain to think that whenever you get that craving it gets that thing with which it will  eventually associate with. 

Also, you really need to 'want' to change. Knowing that you *should* change and say that you want to change isn't enough. You really, deep down, need to want to change. ""First let me say this.  I think you really have to want to quit for any program to work.  That being said, I used Chantix and followed their program.  After three days I had smoked my last cigarette, that was 3 1/2 years ago.  Good luck!""My son was born, and a year later I realized I was spending money that I should be spending on him for my own disgusting habit. It hurt me when I wanted to buy him a something that costed $100 and my wife told me that after the bills were paid, there wouldn't be enough left over. Insert gut punch here. Cold Turkey the next day. I realized that man cannot serve two masters, so I chose my son's happiness over my own, and although I was depressed for the first couple of months, it gets a little easier every day. Plus no more running outside for a quick smoke and leaving the TV as a 5 minute babysitter. Not a day goes by that I dont think about smoking, but I have been healthier, sleeping better, and dont have stomach problems that used to plague me from smoking.""This might sound stupid but when I tried to quit smoking years ago, a doctor told me the best way is ""cold turkey"". I didn't know the definition of it and thought the actual cold turkey at my supermarket could help so I went on a strict cold turkey diet for the next two week....""I noticed that when i felt sick I would smoke less. I waited until I had a major life change approaching, getting married, and timed my quitting to the day after my bachelor party. I drank heavy and smoked like a pack and a half in 4 hours.

The next day I was soooooooo sick and I have never even felt the urge to smoke since. It was just a little mental trick but it worked like a charm and my brain will always associate that awful feeling with smoking.

Edit: strangely though drinking got off scott free.""First it was understanding that relapse is a part of recovery; the more times you try to quit the more likely the next time will be the last.

Then I went cold turkey several times. I ignored people who joked that this was the last time until the next time. Finally though I quit and it stuck. I haven't smoked in around three years.

You quit smoking everyday for the rest of your life. Someone will light up and you'll smell it and you will get that familiar feeling between your fingers and in your head; it never goes all the way away.""Just cut back to start with, that way you don't obsess over wanting a smoke, and don't keep telling yourself and others ""I quit"". It's how I did it, I would maybe smoke one every so often. Now I can't even stand the smell of them.""Lots of people say you have to really want to quit smoking. I'm not really sure that's true.  I really wanted to quit hundreds of times of the course of my 20+ years smoking habit but never did. I have tried to quit a dozen times as well. 

Most times with I had tried to quit, I had a great reason and/or a strong motivators to quit.

To get me through the first couple weeks, I sat in front of my computer, joined a quit smoking forum, and I used them as a support group.  

It worked for me""Cold Turkey - but you have to have the right motivator. See below

NPR just had an EXCELLENT story about this subject. It involved Present Bias and the need to find something that you can compete with the now desire, not the future promise. And this actually worked for me.

**EDIT - Found it** - [You Vs. You](http://www.radiolab.org/story/117291-you-v-you/)

In my case, I had a girl that I was madly in love with and she was tired of the smoke. One day she said could not deal with it anymore and did not want to deal with cancer like she did with her father. She was on the verge of leaving.

So the ""now"" threat, became stronger than the ""now"" desire. It worked much better than promising myself something in the future, which I had been doing for years. It took a strong motivator in the now to get me to quit. the trick is, finding a treat that is persistent with your smoking habit.

In the case of the NPR story, a lady trying to quit had been trying to do so for some time. Did all the thing some people tell you to do about making promises to yourself, incremental slowdown. None of it worked for her. So, she made an agreement with her friend, that if she ever smoked again, he friend had authorization to donate $5,000 to the KKK. She HATED the KKK. So the now threat became bigger than the now desire. She has not smoked in 10 years... cold turkey.

Everyone is different, but it is a solid strategy with proven results. Seems like some of your top comments have similar scenarios... current persistent detractors that were greater than the need to smoke.""I have quit a couple times but never 100% usually for a week or two.  The few things that have made me quit, women (if I am dying for her and she wants me to quit I will), Money (I cut back from 4-5 packs a week to 1-2 when I moved to Chicago), and e-cigarettes.  Now with e cigs I usually hit up a cigarette a day some times I get cravings and go through a couple in a day.  Overall, smoking was a college addiction for me.  Now that I am out I am taking 4 more years to move out of the festi, potsmoking, binge drinking, lung destroying habits."Exercise and flavored toothpicks. "I said to myself, ""Stop being a little bitch."" So I did, and I quit.
""29 years smoking a pack a day, here.

I had tried everything but Chantix and hypnosis.

I had quit cold turkey for about 3 weeks. These were my symptoms for 5-6 days:

- Cold sweat

- Blurred vision

- Flu-like muscle pain all over my body

- Mood swings with outbursts of rage

Since Chantix looks really too scary I went for hypnosis. Because it was the last thing on my list and I could tell my family I had tried everything. Hypnosis is for bored to tears menopausal Berkeley women, right?

The session lasted 20 minutes, and the lady told me I was "" a non-smoker now, buh-bye gotta take care of my next patient"".

I remember telling myself when I was driving back home, fuming, I would write her the nastiest Yelp review in the history of yelp. I was mad all evening. I had a very busy next morning and by noon I realized that I had not smoked. Normally I would have had at least 5 cigarettes.

It was 14 months ago. I haven't had a cigarette since.""Exercise, time and patience."flu"Find some old (ideally 70+) people who never quit and observe them *very* carefully. Watch their mannerisms. Really look at the details of their skin, the color of their eyes, how much hair they have, etc. ""Alan Carr's book ""The Easy Way"". ""I have not been smoking for 6 month, I started doing cardio wich was VERRY hard because my lungh were bad. I also started taking nicoret pills (not chewing gum). So when I was suposed to smoke (at the end of a job day for exemple) I popped a nicorette. What made me do it instead of lighting up? I was thinking about that horrible sensation that I had while doing cardio, like breathing cream instead of air.""Go to a hospital, see how miserable someone is with lung cancer, sit down and contemplate how awful it will be for the last time you are on this earth your coughing up blood with a shortness of breath."You have to want to quit and also staying away from people who smoke. I relapsed a few times because almost all of my friends smoked. But I made it! And so can you!"Well I see most people here are saying that the gum, patches, lozenges, etc. don't work, but they worked for me.  I bought the patch and used that after I had my morning shower.  They say they last all day, but it would start wearing off around 5pm or so.  Usually I would work out after work (5pm), so I would take my patch off before my workout.  

Then later on in the day when I was craving a smoke, I'd use a nicotine lozenge (or two) to get through the night.  Eventually I didn't need the lozenges anymore, as the patch was good enough to get me through most of the day.  Then eventually didn't need the patch anymore.  

Good luck! ""I was at two packs a day and had been smoking for ten years at this point. This is how I did it: Patches come in three stages and recommend you wear each stage for 2 weeks. I doubled the time, wearing each stage for four weeks. I also replaced cigarettes with Dum Dum suckers (I sucked about 15 Dum Dums a day). During all of this I exercised daily save for one day a week (Personally, I ran, but do anything that works up a sweat and gets your heart rate going.) I also abstained from drinking for the first month. It wasn't super easy, but if you actually want to quit and have thought about the reasons why you want to, and you have a respectable amount of willpower, this could work for you. 

EDIT: Smoke free for a year now.""Quitting something is a negative, you need to fill that void with something positive or you're just going to keep looking at that hole in your life until you cave in. I found exercise filled that void best because it really did come down to 'one or the other'. Once I had built up enough endurance to jog a bit the idea of having a cigarette after that jog just didn't seem right.

tl;dr - don't quit, replace."Chantix worked for me."People don't really talk about this much, but try dropping acid.""Go back to 1968. Everyone smoked. My mother was about 2 years old. My grandfather smoked some 40 a day, not counting cigars. My grandfather lost his dad at 14 to a bad bout of flu (at that time, some 10 years prior to this story, the pneumonia he suffered from wasnt considered smoking related, even though it almost certainly was). He had grown close to one of his uncles, who had sort of stepped in to help out. This uncle, my great, great uncle, died. Lung disease. My grandmother stayed home with my mum, but my grandfather went to the funeral. 

When he came home, he looked at mum playing on the floor, and without saying a word, took the half finished pack from his pocket and threw it out the window. Never touched tobacco since.

Skip forward some 35 years. Mum is now in her late 30s, I am about 12 or so, so its some 8 years ago now. We are planning a big family holiday. All booked up when my grandfather falls ill. Too ill to fly. Flu. Then pneumonia. At the time I just thought he had a cold, but I can see now that everyone was terrified. After all, the same thing had killed his father. Well we leave, after he makes us, and while on holiday, he gets a lot worse. The man isnt educated. But he is smart. He called his friend, got him to check in every day just in case. Both of them witness my grandfather hacking up this black fluid. Buckets and buckets of it. This continues for a week. The fluid thins, lightens and finally stops. My grandfather recovers. His lungs will always be scared, but amazingly, after 35 years cold turkey, he is tar free.

My grandfather is the most amazing man I have ever met. He is 74 this year. He walks a mile into town every day to get the paper and then walks the mile back. Rain, sun, sleet, even hail. He has the energy of someone a quarter of his age and often plays football (soccer) with my brother for over an hour or more. He is currently redecorating our house, he gardens (and I mean he digs up trees) and a couple of years ago I took him to a Willie Nelson concert, where he was on his feet, singing, dancing and yelling for as long as Willie was. He is never happier than when he has a painters brush in his hand, a tin of emulsion balanced on the rung above his feet and country on the radio. He has been married 51 years to my grandmother, 73, who also walks into town to get the shopping every day, stopping off for a cup of tea with each of 5 different people. Despite the town changing a lot in the last 70 years, you only have to take a walk with them to say hi to at least 50 people, all of whom know them by name and sight. Neither worked jobs that paid more than minimum wage, they have no savings to speak of and cant afford many luxuries, but this year, when my girlfriend from the States came to spend christmas, they each forked out close to å£50 on presents for her, because ""If you two stay together or not, shes family, and we love her."" Before this, the last time they met her was for 5 minutes. 

Quitting smoking single handedly saved my grandfathers life. He continues to be an inspiration to me, and his words of wisdom have guided me, despite me enjoying a much better quality of life than he ever had. And if I ever need to smile, I just need to talk to him.

TL:DR Grandfather smoked 40 a day, plus cigars. He quit because he knew it would kill him. The tar stayed in his system for 30+ years, but he is clear of it now, and healthier than most his age. You can do it /u/barbiesarthritis. It will be tough, but I, for one, know you can."ecigs.and trees.E-cigs."wikibot, what is Cold Turkey?""For me it was the opposite of every advice I heard.

Instead of throwing away your smokes and resisting temptation.  I bought every kind of smokes that I loved.  Expensive ones that I only smoked on rare occasions, pipe tobacco, chew, cigars, and anything else I'd ever tried.  I surrounded myself with these and kept them by me always.  I wanted to make sure I could always have a smoke lit in 5 seconds.

The rationale for me was that if I couldn't say no to smoking, I hadn't quit.

I also fasted for a few days.  Apparently that helps reduce your dependency on nicotine (I don't know if this is true).

Over 1000 days smoke free now!""I've been quit now for 6 years. I tried many things to quit, but Chantix helped me finally kick the addiction. I was able to continue smoking for the first week and the physical addiction was totally gone after about two. That being said, if you're considering Chantix, be ready for some really strange dreams and some bad moods while your body goes through withdrawl."chantix worked for me. used it for a week and i was done. it still sucked but it worked. I then had nightmares for the next three months of either killing people or being killed. but i dont smoke anymore so it was worth it."Games, played a hella a lot of games to distract me those first few days. I took a few days off from work since I'd knew I'd be a bitch and did nothing but play league of legends, skyrim, or bf3 anytime I wanted a smoke. Afterwards when ever I really felt the need to smoke I'd usually force myself into a game of league and since I can't smoke in my house I'm kinda stuck not smoking for at least 35-50 minutes.

TL;DR [League of Legends](http://signup.leagueoflegends.com/?ref=4e8d0b33a96d6790089231)
""I had been smoking regularly for about a month when I looked in a mirror one day and could barely believe my eyes: my skin was a tint of yellow (I'm white as can be), my eyes looked sunken back into their eye sockets, the bags under my eyes had never been so prominent before, and overall I just looked sickly. I cut down to a couple a week and that all disappeared seemingly within days.

On somewhat of a sidenote: is there anyone else who smokes or smoked that just never became addicted? Even during my peak of smoking about 6 cigarettes a day, I only did so because they were relaxing and the people I was hanging out with always had a pack or two between them. I never got any desire to buy a pack for myself, I always bummed them and repaid my friends through food or spare change here and there. To this day I'll smoke a cig if I'm offered one then never think twice about it later. I've never felt the physical craving or withdrawals that so many people profess to, and I've got a horribly addictive personality in general, which is what surprises me the most.

I'd compare it to eating cake: if someone offers me some I'll sure as hell take them up on it, I'll enjoy ever bit of it, briefly fret about my health, maybe think about how good it was later, then proceed to not even consider buying a cake a day. Am I Just an outlier or are there others who are the same way? ""Pneumonia. Might've been unrelated, but it got me to quit cold turkey. 
It's been a year.""Longtime lurker, but had to create an account, because I finally have something worthwhile sharing.

I had been a smoker for around 10 years by the time I eventually 'quit'.
And in that time period, I'd have probably tried quitting at least 75 times.
I tried every trick in the book - from the psychotherapy, to nicotine gum etc (not electronic cigarettes, they werent available then).

But every time I failed, I always knew that I would be successful someday.

During one such failure (or maybe the question was forming in recent unsuccessful attempts), I realized that there had to be a pattern for the failure (yes, stress is constantly cited, but that is an excuse). I was looking for an underlying cause.  

Then it hit me - my problem was saying 'Never'.  When I crush a cigarette and threw it away, i was ok for a day,but the thought ate me up inside that i could never smoke again ( as much as i wanted to quit, i enjoyed that shit, it was my friend in times of need, whatever)

Thankfully, I didnt have a medical condition necessitating my quitting, so I had time to play with - I decided to change my approach just a little bit.  

I told myself that I can smoke anytime I wanted to, but I choose not to right now.

The sense of empowerment was unbelievable.

Suddenly, I could keep going for hours without smoking, and keep going even days without smoking.  The pack was always within reach, if I wanted it.

So, see what works for you, and follow it.  Sorry to say, but as long as you are going to rely on 'aid's like electronic cigarettes, it will come back.  

As i tell my friends quitting smoking is a psychological issue, not a physiological one.  The physiological aspect is very easy - you have nicotine patches, gums, electronic cigarettes.  But it's the psychological aspect of it that makes you fall off the wagon.


I had to go through an elaborate mind tricking exercise over a period of 6 months to completely stop buying packets of cigarettes, but it just worked.

I can elaborate further if you need help with how I did it. PM me and i can lay it out.  It's kind of a long winded exercise, and I dont want my response to be longer than it already is.

disclaimer - I havent quit in the true sense.  I still smoke when i get together with old friends. which is probably once or twice in a year, or once in a few years.  I can live with that, compared to half a pack everyday.

TLDR - figure out what your psychological reason is that is making you go back, and deal with it.  But it can be done.""As a former analog smoker now all-digital for about three months, I am really happy to see all the stories of e-smokers gradually lowering the nicotine content until they just don't want it anymore. That's my plan and I'm glad to know it can work. ""I quit chewing tobacco almost a year and a half ago. My girlfriend told me she thought it was disgusting and a deal breaker, and I was sick of having to jump in my car or go home just to have a chew because I was self conscious around my friends. I did it cold turkey, and I honestly think it's the best way. Replacement can work for some, but you're going to deal with the headaches and the urges at some point. Might as well be from day one. 

I made myself a calendar and ticked it off each day I didn't pack a lip. Once you get a month out, look back at that and you'll see that you've come too far to ever go back. I have, and it's been a year. Good luck! ""I quit on the 1st of Jan. and haven't had one since.  I quit cold turkey.  I was up to smoking 2 packs a day after a 25 year habit.  I will tell you what worked for me finally.
Quitting smoking is mainly a matter of mental discipline.  Yes, the physical addiction to nicotine is very real.  However, the withdrawal from the nicotine is nothing compared to the psychological withdrawal.
You must first imagine what it is like to a non-smoker again.  Do you remember not rushing to an exit after departing an airplane?  Or what it is like to just sit and chat after a meal instead of excusing yourself to go  smoke?  Don't you relish the idea of tasting and smelling things again?  You need to really focus on what it was like to be a non-smoker and what it will be like to be a non-smoker again.
Then chose a date and just quit.  Just become a non-smoker!  Get rid of all smoking accessories.  Non-smokers don't need lighters, matches, cigarettes or any other smoking paraphernalia and neither do you.  Every time I thought about smoking after that, I would say to myself ""No thanks, I don't smoke"" as if someone was offering me a cigarette.  For the first couple of weeks I was saying it to myself hundreds of times a day.  It's been 4 weeks now and I maybe think about smoking 3-4 times a day and the cravings aren't bad at all, almost non-existent.  I know I am done smoking forever.
You need to truly want to be and then become a non-smoker.""I categorized my quit into to fronts.  The physiological addiction and the psychological one.

I used the patch system to take care of the physiological addiction.  I trusted that the patch would take care of the physical withdrawals.  I had faith in the patch to do that work for me so that I could direct my energies in battling the psychological addiction.

To deal with my psychological addiction to smoking I had many tricks to help re-associate my habit.  I put some thought into what my triggers were.  

When smoking there is a lot of hand to mouth movement.  I also didn't want to replace that motion with food so I cut straws to the length of a cigarette and kept that motion going for a while until it faded.

I smoked in my car, so knowing that driving would be a trigger, I lit some incense, stuck it between my fingers, and mimicked the motion of ashing out the window. Not only did it help with that association but it smelled great.

I did my best not to over eat (trigger) and I did not drink alcohol for about 2 months after I quit.  Did I get cravings to smoke?  Yes I did.  I had to trust in the patch and re-associate my desire to smoke with some other activity.  My favorite tea helped in those situations.  Want to smoke?  Have some tea.

I even discovered more triggers as I quit.  End of a quest line in WoW?  Commercial break?  Time to smoke.  That surprised me.  I still every once in a while get the desire to smoke but it comes and then it goes away.  I will probably continue to get those desires for the rest of my life, but I have to remember that they go away.  They dont stick around and the longer I have been quit, the further apart those cravings get. 

So yeah, I went from being a pack a day smoker to successfully quitting.  It's been 5 years.  I managed to not only quit, but actually lost 5 pounds doing it so I have that going for me ;) 

Best of luck to you and your process.  You have my support and if you need to talk I am here to help.""Tried an Electronic Cigarette, the juice I used has nicotine but it helped break the habit of smoking. It really made it seem effortless...Haven't had a cigarette since New Years Eve after smoking for about 4 years. Soon I'll switch the juice to the ones without nicotine.""Cold turkey, I've been cigarette free for the better part of 2 years now. I would go out and get drunk, smoke most of a pack, and wake up feeling lie absolute shut in the morning. All you have to do is convince yourself that you hate everything about it and the rest comes easy. After a few days of not doing it, you'll start to notice the horrible smell that it leaves on people.""I tried many things including e-cigs, but the NJoy ecig in particualr made it easy.  Not as good as a smoke but good enough.  After a few weeks I quit the e-cig... cause it just wasn't satisfying enough.  I still keep it with me though for occasional nicy-fits.""I tried nicotine gum other products. I also tried a couple different e cigs. The only thing that worked for me was cold turkey. I was getting very tired of smoking all the time so that helped. One day I lit up and after my first drag I said this is it and it was. I've been known to sneak one when I'm at the bars or something, but what's important for me is that I dont smoke habitually and I don't spend shitloads of money on them every week.""This is going to sound bad, and I don't mean it to degrade anyone's attempts at quitting. This is not advice on how to quit smoking, just my personal experience.

I had tried quitting a few times, stopped smoking for a few months here and there, but always ended up smoking again. After having resigned once more from trying to stop, one night during a party, I drank to the point where I probably had alcohol poisoning. The next day, I had zero desire to smoke at all. It's been probably 6-7 years or so, and I've had a cigarette maybe twice, but it was terrible both times. The desire to smoke went away that night. My guess is I did some damage to my brain, which has been associated with losing addictions.""Willpower and manual labor/tasks to keep my brain and hands busy.

Best decision ever.""I used chantix after talking with my dr. However chantix doesn't quit for you. You still have to quit. 

So I got my script for chantix filled and I didn't start. I played it out like a long drawn out break up with a girlfriend. I told myself I was going to do it. Every smoke I told myself I was going to quit. Then I picked my date. Every time I smoked I thought about that date. 

The night of Dec 2 2012 was the night of my break up. I sat out back for about an hour, had a beer and smoked the rest of my smokes. I only had about 3 left.  As I took each drag I reminded myself that it's for the best.  It needs to be over. 

Before I took my last drag I sat there. I stared at the cherry. I smelled the smoke coming off of it. I stared at the filter, the dotted lines on it, the camel writing at the bottom of the cigarette. 

""Well, it was a good run. But I've got a daughter that I've got to kept up with and be able to see grow up."" 

I took my last drag. Held it in a bit longer. Exhaled through my nose. Put out my cig in the ash tray. I collected all my lighters, ash trays, etc and threw them away. The next morning I started my quitting. Chantix is a 3 month treatment, but I only needed it for about 3 weeks. 

It was my 4th attempt to quit. My first time I actually *wanted* to quit.

Still haven't relapsed. 

TL;DR: you have to want to quit""Just stop buying packs. You may crave one, but just go out side and have a breath of fresh air, enjoy the outside, then go back to waht ever you were doing. Or when you're smoking think or how gross they taste, the smell wet cigarrets. Personally, I found excessive gaming to be much harder to quit than excessive smoking. 

Most importantly, IMO it's totally fine to have one once and awhile. Just smoke in moderation, if possible. I usually do 1 pack a month. Like excessive alcohol and fast food is bad, but once and awhile isn't going to hurt. A nice cool, crisp ciggaretts isn't that bad once and awhile, perhaps during a cold beer while looking across the lake at your cabin up north, or after a fine filling meal to ease the stomach and cause a hint of relaxation and satisfaction. ""Health care here too.  This is gonna sound like BS but while working one night one of my patients (admitted for Exacerbation of COPD) kept sneaking smokes in her bathroom.  Rather than scolding her for smoking in the bathroom, I used the old ""smoking with your condition is killing you"" approach.  Her response was ""that's real good advice from someone who smells like a Marlboro when you come into my room"".  Quit cold turkey right then.  Only time quitting ever worked, smoke free 9 years""I would go through periods (a few hours) with an intense burning pain inside my chest.  (Imagine sunburn... In your lungs.) I'd also wake up in the night unable to breathe, my partner would be woken up by the rattling sound emanating from my chest and I'd get seriously out of breath during sex. That was was about enough motivation to quit cold turkey. 

[edit: words]"Wellbutrin + eCig"Ex-smokeless tobacco user here (dip) 
Quit cold turkey, just look at how expensive it is! like damn""I read Allen Carr's Easyway. This is the second time I have quit, but feel really good about it this time. Make sure not to cut down, go cold turkey and be really patient with yourself and others for just one week. After that, it is just a matter of winning little battles until it gets easier."Nicoderm. Followed all the 3 steps. Have been smoke free for 3 years now. "I tried to quit numerous times and thought it was just a hopeless endeavor, but then I really, deeply thought about the reasons I wanted to quit, thought about the future and how much I didn't want it to be filled with the consequences of smoking, and when I had that mental image the conviction to quit came with it. I still craved it, and, almost a year later, I still do, but that conviction is also still there, and it because it is no longer worth the consequences to me, I have remained strong.
""I quit via the ""cold turkey"" method. It's been five years and I never even vaguely want a cigarette!  I actually started having more and more trouble breathing, using an albuterol inhaler more and more. I thought that I couldn't keep destroying my lungs like that, I could feel that my lungs weren't functioning at full capacity. But my family doctor told me that the lungs will heal themselves almost completely if you quit smoking cigarettes. So I used those images in my mind to keep me NOT WANTING to smoke while I had the cravings: ""lungs...healing..."". Then eventually the cravings were gone and I was free from the shackles!!! So yeah, you have to want it!  Maybe the trick is finding your own reason to ""want it""?""As of writing this, I haven't smoked in 8 days. It's the first time I can recall since I started, when I was 16, that I've gone 8 days without a single puff of a cigarette. I smoked heavily through the end of high school and through college. I'm now 25. 

I could easily kill a pack in a few hours if I was drinking, so Friday and Saturday downtown usually turned into 40 cigarettes in two days. I associated everything in my life with smoking, from driving, to eating, joy, success, failure, loss -- everything. I've known I had a problem for a long time, and have tried everything to quite. Cold turkey, a structured plan to cut down, gum, probably five or six different brands of E-cig (with Blu and Njoy being my favorites), but everything lead back to me smoking again. 

What finally worked for me was the Ego-T electronic vaporizer. It's not in the shape of a cigarette, doesn't mimic the motion of smoking, tastes nothing like a cigarette, and is customizable. That, along with the Livestrong quitting app, which allows you to track when you're craving, allowed me to finally put enough distance between myself and cigarettes. 

The Ego-T was recommended to me by a friend at work who also had been a heavy smoker, though he says he was up to 1.5-2 packs a day. He got the Ego-T and hasn't smoked in two months. That's when I was sold. ""I just stopped. That's it. I decided that I would NOT allow myself to buy another pack, and I didn't. It sucked for the first 2 weeks. After that, it got easy."First I stopped smoking in my car. Then I cut way down. Then I prayed about it. I have not smoked a cigarette since that prayer."I went to visit a friend in New York and realized I wouldn't be able to afford eating *and* smoking during my visit. I had tried a few times before that with the patch and lozenges, but the idea of paying more than $10 for a pack was the last straw!""My wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary in Asheville, NC doing the brewery hop thing, and she caught a nasty case of omgwtfisthis.mp4 so I took her to the ER. The lady (I guess) who shared the triage room with us sounded like..instead of breathing air like us normal folks, large icy marbles percolating in her evaporated lungs like those popcorn lawnmowers we had as kids. I didn't quit that very second but I made a plan to and stuck with it. One year clean and no hiccups. Thanks, jiffy-pop lungs.""Decided on my last pack that when I got to the last cig I'd save it, then drove somewhere scenic and important to me and smoked it, drove away and haven't smoked one since.  Six years.  Failed a few times before the momentous final cig so I'd recommend it if you're a sentimental type at all... If I smoked any cheater cigs after that I'd have ruined the whole experience.""I had just bought a 3-pack deal at the convenience store. I opened the first pack and was ready to light up when I had the thought ""I need to quit."" I went to the kitchen and got a brown paper grocery bag and set it on the coffee table. One by one I took the cigarettes out of the packs, broke them and dropped them in the bag. 

My roommate came in about halfway through the first pack and said ""What the fuck man, give them to me.""  I said ""Nope, they're mine.""

He sat there and watched me slowly crumble them into the bag. After I had crushed about a pack in front of him he pulled out his smokes and joined me. 

I haven't smoked since and it was over 20 years ago. 

I think the ritualistic breaking the cigarettes is what did it. It made a solid memory of the point in time I chose to be a non-smoker."The way I quit chewing was just cold turkey. It sucks but it's worth it. it'll be one year in 2 weeks. Haven't cheated once."Echo what some others are saying.  You want to quit and just quit.  I smoked for 13 years.  After my grandfather's funeral, I decided it was  time.  I waited until after driving home (I smoked a lot in the car).   I chewed a lot of Altoids gum and used a spinning ring for the manual fixation.  It's been 10 years and haven't touched one since.""Just passed 5 years without one.  14 years of smoking.

Chantix helped, but it's not a miracle pill.  If you want to quit it will help you.

I also told myself that one day I want to walk my daughter down the isle.""Smoked for 8 years. Knew I wanted to quit, my car was out of commission for 2 days and I never went to get any or had anyone get smokes for me. From those two days I just quit cold turkey. I didn't really think it was that stressful.""I stopped cold turkey, I stoped buying, threw my lighters out, chewed gum. ""/r/electronic_cigarette
Great community.""I quit smoking but it wasn't cigarettes.  I quit smoking pot. I don't care what people say: ""marijuana isn't addictive"", blah blah blah.  I was addicted.  I was abusing it, I was smoking resin when I ran out, and it was getting in the way of living a normal life.  I had withdrawals the first week. Of course, they weren't as bad as heroin withdrawals, but the symptoms of withdrawal were there.  I quit because I decided I didn't want to live that lifestyle anymore.  I cried and then I quit.  This was over two years ago and I still miss it.  I will never be able to smoke pot again,much like an alcoholic or heroin addict, without abusing it.""""Easy Way To Quit Smoking"" by Allen Carr  for me aswell ""The hardest part is probably actually wanting to quit. Many people quit because they know it is the right thing to do without actually wanting to. That I believe is the first and most important step. 

After that there were a lot of things that helped me, I tried a lot of things but still had certain triggers. Like you and your work break, my issue was something to keep my fingers and mouth busy. So instead of making sure I had a pack of smokes on me I always had about 5/6 lollipops and if the urge hit me at a time when I would normally have one. For me it was waiting for public transport, if the bus wasnt due for 5-10 mins I would just take out a pop and go through hell until the bus arrived. 

I'm not going to say it gets easy but it does get easier than when you start. Best of luck with your efforts and remember you in 10 years will be forever grateful for the day you decided to quit for good."I started running honestly because this cute guy was running. I had been trying to quit for 3 months. I did wear a patch for 3 days. After that I went for a run when I wanted a cigarette. I know that is not possible at every time you a cigarette. The physical exertion let my body know that smoking sucked. I found something I wanted to do more than smoking and I married him too:)  "Honestly, getting sick.  I was sick for a month and couldn't even look at a cigarette.  After I was better, I didn't have any cravings and decided to just quit while I was ahead.  Haven't had a cigarette in three and a half years. ""It takes loads of sheer willpower to quit. I was helped along by the fact that in my state they had raised the price of a pack to around 10$ but even after that fact it still took a lot of effort. Find a substitute for your oral fixation, sweet gum or hard candy maybe. Tell someone what your trying to do so they can help your efforts to an extent. If you are finding it that difficult to quit maybe nicorette or some other nicotine substitution might be the thing for you. Stay strong and try not to snap at people, I had a terribly short fuse the first few months after I quit."I was having sex with a women and about five minutes in I was completely out of breath. I quit smoking and started exercising the next day."I used something called Chantix. One of the side effects where technicolor action movie dreams so that was awesome. It can cause depression in a low number of people.

The way Chantix works, from what I understand, is that the medicine attaches to the same neuro receptors that nicotine usually attaches to. You don't stop smoking while you takes these but over time Nicotine has less and less affect on you and you addition slowly fades away. Worked like a charm. "Having a real fear of dying from it. I have a son. And I couldn't stand the thought of leaving him all alone. My dumb ass dying from smoking. "I worry a lot, and I worried about getting cancer.

Also I only smoke when I drink, hopefully a few cigarettes a month won't kill me."Cold turkey. I decided I wanted to quit so I quit."Wellbutrin.  It's an antidepressant that has a side-effect of making you quit smoking.  

It's magical.  You start taking it and just smoke like you normally would - except eventually, you just forget that you smoke.  Normally, I'd always light a cigarette while walking outside between classes.  One day, I realized I hadn't done that the last two or three times like I normally would - I'd just forgotten to do it.

I can't imagine a less difficult way to quit, I highly recommend it.""Electronic cigarette. I had smoked for 14 years at about a pack a day before I quit. My husband and myself bought a house that we didn't want to smell like cigarettes, so we decided we had to do it. We invested in nice ones, not the gas station junk ones. It was a little over $100 for the batteries, juice, charges and cartomizers. The trick was finding the *perfect* juice that hit the spot. It took a while to find one, but now I have a few.

I(as well as my husband) haven't touched a cigarette in 11 months now and I can't stand the smell of them. My brother who had smoked about 16 years quit the same way.

I know some people say the e-cig is like cheating, and we don't really know what's in them...but to me, to get myself away from all the other chemicals in real cigarettes this was the best choice. Now that I'm only addicted to the nicotine, I think it would be a hell of a lot easier to quit completely. ""Huge sinus infection.  Couldn't breathe or smoke.  After 6 months of misery, and lots of drugs - CURED!  And no desire to start smoking again.  There is
 probably an easier way but it worked for me.
""I had smoked for decades and as much as I hated being addicted I truly enjoyed smoking and had no health issues because of it. I was pretty active and would cross country ski or bike for hours often taking a smoke break on long hills but for years it had nagged me that I needed to have those cigarettes and I was spending about three hundred bucks a month on the stuff. One day I found a little book in a used book store. It was ragged and cost me a buck. I read a lot so I took it home and read it in one sitting. A week later I quit cold turkey and I truly was amazed by how painless it was. My wife was amazed and asked how I did it (she had been smoking pretty much all her adult life as well). I gave her the book and a month later she quit cold turkey too and we both have never had another smoke. I never looked back. That was six years ago and I can sit in a room full of smokers and it doesn't bother me. The book is called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. One of the amazing experiences of my life. I wish you success in your endeavour. Cheers
""I signed up for an Olympic distance triathlon and started a blog detailing my training and the experiences leading up to the triathlon.  I shared it with all my family and friends who followed my journey to becoming a triathlete.  This provided a significant amount of peer pressure to finish the triathlon.  

And I can tell you, smoking makes triathlon training suck.  A lot.  So I got to the point where I avoided smoking because I knew how much it was going to make my running/swimming/bike training the next day.  

By the time I was a month from the triathlon I had given up on smoking entirely and I haven't looked back since, which has been about 5 years now.

BTW - I smoked a pack a day for over 15 years.
""I love smoking the whole act of it.  However, I did quit by chewing a fuckton of gum and mints.  It helps if you actually go away from your work area, which is really what I needed. 
""The first week is the hardest part. I was told to go to a sauna every day for the first week, that sweating would help purge the nicotine and make the cravings stop sooner. Worked for me!""After 10+ years of puffing and many failed attempts to quit switched to e-cigs three months ago, easy. I might smoke a cig or two once a month at a party or in a bar but that doesn't trigger the smoking habit, rather pushes it back further.""I only smoked a few years so honestly for me it was not that hard. I just realized I did not like smoking, but rather the addiction and habit make you think you do. I just told myself I had to get over my brain tricking me into wanting one and just recognize it as a tick and not a real desire. I just cold turkeyed it until eventually I could just forget about them.""To stop smoking cigarets, i started smoking more pot, no jk""First realize Nicotine only provides relief from the uncomfortableness it causes.  It does not relax you, it does not mellow you out, it does not make you less anxious, it does the opposite of all of those things and smoking another cigarette only  temporarily relieves the symptoms.  It's a trick that keeps people chained to their nicotine.

Second realize that smoking is unhealthy and you want to be a healthy person.  Putting that crap in your lungs makes it harder to breath and get oxygen into your blood which means its harder to exert yourself, ie exercise.  Instead of going outside to smoke a cigarette, go outside to run around the building or do some push ups.  You will be amazed at how quickly you improve once you quit smoking and you'll still have an excuse to take a break.

Third forgive yourself but don't give up! Most people on here are saying things 'I just decided I didn't want to smoke anymore and stopped', they are kidding themselves, I know a lot of smokers and It's never that easy. It took me 6 months of trying to quit, I tried patches, e-cigs and read a book (The Easy Way to Quit smoking) stopped drinking avoided smokers, in the end it was each one of these things that got me closer and closer until I finally just realized it was easier to quit then keep up with bumming cigarettes or searching through my roommates ashtrays (yes its fucking disgusting). All these people that say they just decided one day are lying because there's not a smoker in the world who doesn't want to quit, yet they keep smoking.  So obviously you have to get yourself to a point where you don't just want to quit but you need to quit.

Its not easy, but its totally doable and afterwards things get so much better you will feel 100% healthier, like you just got 10 years younger. Best thing is now you'll have a good reason to buy that $5 smoothie or the fancy latte or the expensive beer at the bar instead of the cheap stuff because now your saving all that money you would be throwing to the cig companies so reward yourself with something! Good luck!""Another vote for cold turkey.  Also I made sure everyone knew when I was going to stop, that way no matter who i was with I had support.  What also helped immensely was trying to cultivate disgust when smoking, i.e. thinking about all the shit going into my lungs with every drag and the harm it was doing to me every time.  By the time quitting time came i was eager to stop and it was consequently much MUCH easier than I'd feared.""just remember that willpower is a resource.

i stopped cold turkey 10 months ago after 10 years of smoking, and although it was brutal in the beginning, i just kept reminding myself of what i was gaining:
- no more money spent on cigs.
- every cig you don't smoke is more time you'll have with your loved ones in the end.
- http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html --this website helped me look forward to the changes in my body after quitting.
- fingers/breath don't stink like shit!
- everything the top post says.""I'm sure people have suggested Carr's book, but I thought most of the book was too preachy. One thing that stuck out to me, though, was the idea that quitting smoking is actually not that hard. More specifically, that the notion that quitting is difficult has been strongly reinforced by media in order to increase the sales of nicotine patches, pills, etc. 

A bit conspiratorial, I know. But I coupled that with the understanding that the physical craving actually isn't that bad. I've never woken up in the middle of the night shivering because I needed a cigarette. 

What ultimately did it for me was when I woke up extremely hung over from the night before - too hung over to get out of bed and have a cig. Eventually, it became 18 hours of not having a smoke - the longest I went without one in 3 years. So I just asked myself how long I could keep it up. When combined with the beliefs I outlined above, it was annoying but easier than I expected.  "I smoked for about a year pretty consistently. I just looked at the money spent and put it away in dollar amount in a  tin and looked at it and said I didn't spend that money today yay. Eventually it added up and I didn't need to do it anymore. "One day I came with the conclusion that, sooner or later I would have to stop smoking. That day I got my last cigar, looked at it and said: ""This will be my last cigar ever."" and smoked it like it was indeed the last cigar of my life. This was 3 years ago and after that I never smoked again.""Hypnosis. Smoked for ten years a pack a day. Walked into the office smoking never smoked again been almost 3 years. You aren't that far under that he could make you cluck like a chicken or anything , you wouldn't take his advice or do anything you don't agree with. All you need is to be open about being able to get hypnotized and willing to try it. Good luck
""My mom got hypnotized. She had to go back a few weeks later, but after the second time she never had the urge to smoke again. "I quit after my dad suddenly died 2 weeks after being diagnosed with cancer. 43 years old"First of all--what I've seen with all of my friends who have tried e-cigs is that they just go back to smoking sooner or later (usually sooner). The hardest part about quitting isn't the nicotine (though that is very hard), it's breaking the hand-to-mouth habit. This is one of the reasons people gain weight after quitting. The oral fixation or compulsion remains, and as it eventually lessens over time your cravings become less harsh.

For me, I smoked 8 years and quit last June. I started with the patch, used it for two weeks before I had a relapse (damn Fourth of July) and went cold turkey after that. So, I am a huge proponent of both the patch and cold turkey! But I don't think I could have made that initial leap without the help of the patch.""I manned the fuck up one day, threw out my pack, and went cold turkey. Haven't had a cigarette in almost 5 years. Once you get past the first two weeks you are clear, you just need to have willpower. Willpower and distractions. And NO DRINKING.""Have a good reason and smoke too much- I wanted to start a family and wanted to be healthy - my wife didn't smoke and every attempt I made I failed at once I drank. I went to Las Vegas and stayed up over 24 hours and drank too much smoked over 3 packs and basically made myself sick of the taste and smell of cigarettes - I couldn't breathe properly and was coughing.  I couldn't smoke anymore and that was it - I quit - when I drank or was in social situations, I ate - I gained weight - oh well - that was 20 years ago.  I now run 10km, bike 250km a week, hike high elevations and play hard with my 2 kids. Quitting smoking was the best thing. I had more important things to do in my life than spend money on smokes, be unhealthy and smell like an ashtray.""1st time (1995, after about 4 years of smoking) - moving to a new house (couldn't smoke inside anymore) + the patch (I was terrified of smoking with it on because I'd heard horror stories)

2nd time (2002, after a six month stumble off the wagon) - my husband knew I had started again, but thought I had quit after only three months.  I was going to have to spend Christmas Day with him the entire day, so I couldn't get away + Zyban."I quit cold turkey and I was halfway through a cigarette as well. But after 13 years of smoking a pack a day I had mentally built up a level of disgust in myself and my habit. The day I quit I had a cold and that also helped. "When i had health insurance, Chantix worked amazingly.  I just so happened to have been graduating at the time, did 3 all nighters in a row, and was caught staring at a computer screen finishing my thesis for 4 hours doing nothing.  and it so happened that my dr. failed to mention that there was a part 2 to the process.  (i did the first month, but didnt follow through with the second month)  Had i did it properly, i know it would have helped me.    
  
but the best way i quit so far, is have a girlfriend that is 100% against smoking and will punish you in every way a girlfriend can.  i promised her i would quit if the giants won the super bowl, and when they did, i quit cold turkey.  it sucked at first, im finishing 2 years with out any.    
  
good luck.  quitting sucks.  but just stay focused and tell yourself that you're better than a stupid pack of cigarettes.  
  
If you have a water cooler, maybe try going there for a cup of water, finish the cup there, then go back to your desk?  then you get to include another moment of break by having to do frequent bathroom stops too.  :)  Again, good luck.  ""Toothache and E-cigs.

Had really bad toothache for about 4 days and didn't **want** to smoke for that amount of time. After that I started thinking, ""I wonder if I could make it a week."" Then it was ""I wonder if I can make it 10 days"", ""I wonder if I can make it a fortnight"" ""I wonder if I can make it a month"" etc.

Co-incidentally a friend of mine also started an e-cig business not long before this happened so after about a week of cold turkey I started using these for about a month. After an alcohol-related incident that resulted in the demise and breakage of said e-cig, I was fine to go completely without.""I'll preface this by saying it's not a recommended method, obviously.

I quit successfully by getting horrifically ill with influenza.  I had been trying to quit for years, but never really managed to do it. Then, while visiting a friend in another town, I came down with the flu.

 Apparently I was delirious for over a day, and bed-ridden for another 2 days.  By the time I felt well enough to go outside for a smoke, I was over the worst of the withdrawal.  I did try to smoke anyway, but it hurt so damn much due to my ravaged lungs, I put it out after one drag and never smoked again. ""I quit smoking cold turkey 164 days ago.  What i found helped was not thinking of it as quitting smoking, but as choosing not to having the next cigarette.  You can easily not have one cigarette, now just make that choice over and over again until you ""quit"". 

I also found that quitting in conjunction with other changes in my life helped.  I quit right before i moved into a new appartment, so i had no ""triggers"" for me to smoke, no more sitting on the front stoop smoking and people watching, no more friend's in the building encouraging me to come out for a smoke and a chat. I have no smoking associations in my new place.  I have never smoked there, and there is nothing there that makes me think of smoking.

You can do this!""My wife got pregnant with our son, and I quit cold turkey. One of the hardest things I've ever done, but I want to be around for awhile haha. He's worth it""I was driving to work one day and I was out of smokes and I thought to myself ""man, I should stop at the drugstore and get a pack"" and then I just thought ""....no actually. I don't want to smoke anymore"". It's been two years and I haven't gone back. The first month or so was HELL but now I would rather die than light a cigarette. ""I know this is lame, but after 3 years of smoking regularly, pack in a day or two, one sunny day when I was walking home I just said to myself: ""I'll quit smoking now."" And I did. There was nothing else to it, no particular reasons or anything.

Now after like 6 years or something, Ive started smoking when I'm drunk if my friends have cigarettes. There's that certain appeal to it. But I don't drink very often either.""I just got sick of waking up every morning with my lungs hurting, and getting bronchitis every single year.

I did the gum for a couple weeks and got sick of using it, gradually scaled back until that was it. Actually it was a pretty short period, that is after smoking a half pack to a pack a day over a 10 year period."I used champix. It can have side effects but for me it was really successful. Today is actually a year since my last cigarette. "I remember asking my grandmother once if she ever missed it (smoking) and she looked me dead in the eye and said "" All the time"". Years later when I started ""quitting"", I remembered what she said, and realized ""once an addict, always an addict"". 5 years later, they mostly disgust me, but sometimes I think I really want one. I just know I can't have one. BTW, the reason for quitting was the birth of my daughter.""Calculate the amount of money you're handing over over to these evil corporate pricks. It's not like you're paying them for something enjoyable like a holiday, game console, nice food etc. 
They're selling you twigs wrapped in paper laced with chemicals to make them even more addictive. Picture them sitting back in comfy chairs, sipping brandy, while you pay them your hard earned cash because they have fooled you into thinking you need their product. ""I ended up learning how to juggle instead. Took me about 3 weeks or so to really perfect it, but every time I had the urge to smoke I picked up the balls and started working on them.

""This free PDF book was recommended in another forum and no bullshit it works. I read it in one night and quit smoking cold turkey they next day after smoking for over 20 years. it was easy, you just need to know what nicotine is and why you crave it so much. all is explained here: http://media.wix.com/ugd/74fa87_2010cc5496521431188f905b7234a829.pdf

if you are thinking of quitting please spend a few hours and read this, life is so much better smoke free.. there are no add and no bullshit to buy, its just facts and common sense. 

""Honestly vaping is the way to go. I was smoking a pack and half a day and as soon as I got an e-cig it went down to 2 cigarettes a day. They're so much better than cigarettes; taste great, no smell and I can smoke inside and around my girlfriend. I tried quitting cold turkey but it just didn't work for me, I loved the act of smoking too much, I don't think I was so much addicted to nicotine as I was to actually smoking, so vaping is perfect for me. ""e cigs helped me for sure, at least they helped me slowing down and smoking less reg cigarettes. Reading the Sub reddit here did some good as well, but what triggered it was the idea of getting sick and not be able to see my daughter grow up or get married.     

 I recommend joining the GYM, exercising helped me NOT think about smoking... I stopped hanging out with smokers pretty much too, I had to do it :("Did everything I could to give myself the flu. I never smoked when I was sick so after being sick for a week I just didn't start again."10 year smoker.  penis lost some of its power.  no choice, had to quit.""I [posted a few months ago] about quitting my 3 pack a day habit (http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1nfqe1/a_year_ago_today_i_was_a_3packsaday_smoker_a_year/) about quitting my 3 pack a day habit , and I'll just paste it here...

I quit through a regiment of cussing, snacking, and bribery.

That voice in your head that tells you you need to smoke is a lying sack of shit. That is not your brain talking. That is your addiction talking. Every chance you get, you tell that little shit to shut the fuck up.

Examples:

**Voice:** YouÛªve had a rough day! How can you be expected to quit on a day like this? You deserve a pack!

**You:** Shut the fuck up, dummy. What I deserve is fancy-ass Digiorno pizza for dinner and two motherfucking king size ReeseÛªs cups for dessert


**Voice:** YouÛªve gone three days without a cigarette! Man thatÛªs pretty good. You know what you should do to celebrate? Pick up a pack or two on the way home!

**You:** Shut the fuck up, asshole! Are you fucking stupid? To celebrate three days of not smoking I am going to go buy a $5 drink from motherfucking Starbucks and then go ogle hotties on the street. Fuck you.

**Voice:** Wow, so five days without smoking. Today was kind of rough, huh? You should take it easy, you know? Go pick up a pack, ease into this quitting. Just step it down. ItÛªs not like anybody knows youÛªre trying to quit, except one or two people. And everyone kind of expects you to just keep smoking anyway.

**You:** Shut. The Fuck. Up. Bitch almighty of the planet Dumbfuck, just shut your ignorant fucking hole.


**Voice:** Look at you! You made it a whole week without smoking! Holy shit! Can you believe it? Those assholes thought youÛªd never make it. You sure showed them! Boy, glad thatÛªs over. Welp, nowÛªs as good a time as any to go pick up a pack!

**You:** Shut the fuck up! Are you fucking stupid? This isnÛªt going to happen. WhatÛªs going to happen is me and my pajamas and this 2 pound bag of Jolly Ranchers and you shutting the fuck up, idiot.


**Voice:** You could just have one. No one would blame you.

**You:** I would blame me, you weak fucking sack of shit. Shut the fuck up.


**Voice:** Damn, donÛªt you take breaks at work any more? You just come in here, clock in, stay inside all day. DonÛªt you want to go outside? IÛªm sure you can find a co-worker to bum you a smoke.

**You:** You fucking twerp. Leave me alone. I - wait. Yeah, outside sounds fine. IÛªm heading out for some Starbucks. Nice try, idiot.


I also bribed myself. A bribe for each non-smoking day, each non-smoking week, each non-smoking month, and at six months, and at a year. Examples:

Every day: an app or song, or something around $1. Sometimes IÛªd just go into a dollar store and see whatÛªs up.

Every week: Something around $15, a book or album (I was starting to listen to the blues and thatÛªs kind of a hassle to get your hands on in an instant-gratification sort of way. I live in Chicago; it's pretty easy to find in a store here.)

Every month: Something around $50-60: going out for a nice dinner, a new article of clothing, a video game, whatever.

At six months: Something around $150

At one year: TBD, but it looks like IÛªll be picking up a cheap little tablet.

So, when youÛªre struggling with falling off the wagon, when ÛÏjust oneÛ sounds like a good idea, or when ÛÏI deserve a cigaretteÛ is pounding in your brain, just remember: you deserve better than a smoke, and that little voice is slowly trying to kill you. You're better than this, and you're gonna be fine.

**Edit** Another thing that really helped was that I'd put my milestones on Facebook, Twitter, etc. It didn't matter if it was a 3-month milestone or just some random day (""104 days of no smoking!""), the positive feedback from people I actually knew in real life was a big help, too.""Swimming. I found it extemely therapeutic.  The breathing control needed for swimming really helped me deal with stress and lung recovery.  I also found that I enjoyed the satisfaction of beating peraonal bests, if I smoke it hugely affects my performance so that was a major factor when for me when gaced with an opportunity to have a cigarette. ""I knew that I wanted to stop, so I stopped purchasing cigarettes, but I would bum them off people at parties etc.  Then finally I moved to a new town away from everyone I knew who smoked, and by the time I went back home I had lost all desire to smoke. I guess just not being around smokers really helped.""cutting down on alcohol + getting sick of feeling like garbage. cigs caused me alot of stomach/esophagus issues, plus feeling generally rundown. once I quit I felt better. ""After trying 7 - 8 times to go cold turkey without any mental or emotional preparation, I made a determination in July of 2011 to quit on November 1st, 2011. During those few months I had a conversation with myself every time I had a cigarette about how it was going to be one of my last ones. By the time I reached October 31st, I didnt even really want one anymore. I've been cig free ever since. I think the mental preparation and planning in advanced definitely helped me.""I tried cold-turkey a couple times, and always went back to smoking after a week or two. The patch is finally what did it for me; though it's success rate is documented to be fairly low. Wearing the patch took the edge off the transition period, but personally it was avoiding nicotine poisoning which kept me from smoking. Even if you rip the patch off and go outside to smoke, the extra nicotine is still in your system, so that smoke is going to make you feel extra woozy. It wasn't something I could tolerate at work, so that's how I was forced to form new habits. 

It took almost 2 months before I stopped getting up from my desk to go outside and smoke every time I finished to most minuscule little task. But once I was over that, I eventually just began forgetting to put the patch on in the morning, and then I was all done.""Congratulations on wanting to quit enough to reach out. Wanting to quit bad enough to express that desire is definitely a prerequisite to succeeding. I quit 11 months ago, and this time it's permanent. I bet having several nagging factors makes it easier. For me the main factors were my two little toddlers asking why I was going outside to 'blow fire' instead of staying inside to play. Best of luck. You'll feel great when your out of the woods. Remember also: quitting is not as hard as the industry wants you to believe. ""Before you continue to read this is completely serious. Smoking marijuana actually helped me quit cigarettes. Id tell myself, if you smoke a ciggy now at work then you can't smoke weed when you get home. I found that I liked smoking weed 100x better then cigs cause I just felt so much better afterwards. Though it does take a lot of willpower cause you really gotta believe that you won't let yourself smoke weed if you smoke a ciggy. But anyway good luck brother, hopefully you will join the ranks of the nicotine-free soon!""Accept the desire to smoke. Don't smoke regardless. You are a human being with free will. You don't punch people that annoy you either. Because you decide what you do. Realize you have the power over your actions, and act like you are a grown person.""You did not get addicted to tobacco overnight. Why is it, that you expect to quit overnight? Quitting is a slow process. give yourself some time. Set a small daily goal, (1 less cigarette per day, perhaps?) don't be so hard on yourself, when you don't meet that goal. (you're not a failure! You're still trying.) Be reasonable and remember that the physical effects of withdrawal are very real. They are not in your head, but actually, in your body. Different organs in your body are not receiving the nicotine that they've become use to and will act accordingly. Pains, aches, sweats are real manifestations of withdrawal.

Patches, gum and e-cigs are good to a certain extent, but are you trying to stop putting smoke in lungs or do you want to break your addiction to nicotine. It's like asking a heroin-addict, ""Are you just trying to stop using needles, because you could always just switch to pills..."" 

(Last edit, I promise!) As an ex-nurse, I ask this: Are you taking breaks, so that you can smoke or are you smoking, because you need to take a break? With me, it was always the latter. That time, right there is a good chance to skip that 1 or 2 cigs that day.""Champix did it for me (I believe it is called different in USA, but just can't remember what it is)""Finding out my gf at the time (now wife) was allergic to smoke.  Obviously, this isn't an easily repeatable method."I actually had to try meditation there were so many times the urges became overwhelming I'd have to pause what I was doing collect myself recognize my brain has been hijacked by a chemical substance forcing me to do things I didn't want to do.

It gives you real motivation to quit.Planning on quitting for my birthday in 2 weeks. This thread is a huge morale boost. Thanks to all who shared"I took some fire MDMA and smoked two packs of reds in 12 hours

I couldn't taste for a week""My stepfather tried for years to quit smoing. He tried patches, gum, those weird lozenges.. Nothing seemed to work. One day he started having one of his coughing fits. This was all too normal, since he had been smoking for some forty years. I noticed though, that he started going into the bathroom to hide his coughing. It didn't dawn on me to ask him why. He'd always coughed in front of us before. Turns out, he was coughing up blood for about a week before it got bad enough that he went to the emergency room. 
He went to a couple of specialists after a lot of testing. They found a small capsule in his lungs, which contained SOMETHING, but they couldn't tell you what. The capsule was filled with a disease that his body was unable to fight off, so his lungs encapsulated it instead. The doctor said he had seen this once before and that it was TB. GREAT. 
What caused the bleeding is that the capsule was sitting on a cluster of capillaries and these would burst when he began coughing.
Oh, and another thing.. if he kept having fits like that, the bleeding wouldn't be a big deal, but the capsule could burst and whatever disease that is in there would be released into his body.

GREAT. So he either had to quit smoking immediately, or get Tuberculosis and die at some random point in time. (His immune system was shot and he probably wouldn't have survived.)

His words, ""Well, they've kept me in this damn hospital bed without a cigarette for four days, may as well stop now while I'm ahead.""

He never picked up another cigarette. It's been 3 years. 

**TLDR:**quit smoking or get tuberculosis.""I'm currently a smoker at the moment because I work full time, go to school full time and there is only so much coffee one can drink in a day before you start hearing colors.  I know it's an excuse, but they keep me going at the moment.  But I plan to quit on April 6th of this year, which happens to be my last day of school.  I had a physical and everything was good, except my cholesterol.  Smoking, naturally, needs to go by the wayside to get that back in check.  

He asked me what I planned to do about quitting and I told him an e-cigarette.  He approved since it stimulates the physical addiction to cigarettes and causes spikes in nicotine levels, just like real cigarettes do while patches and gums give you a steady level throughout the day.

I have a blu e-cigarette and although it does provide nicotine and helps with the physical habits, it's like eating nothing but vegetables when you're used to eating a fat piece of steak; never satisfied.  

Cold turkey is the name of the game and so many of you here have done it that way.  My brother also quite cold turkey using gum.  Looks like on April 6th, I'll be taking a temporary trip to asshole rage land.""Chantix.  Smoked pack and a half a day for 15 years.

The chantix reduced my urge to smoke and the toothpicks got me over my oral fixation. You will also need to replace behaviors you associated with smoking. For me the hardest part was not smoking with my morning coffee"Champex. Totally worked. High risk, high reward. "Champix. "It took me a long time to quit... like, 30 years.  Gradually the health problems started taking their toll.  I have stage II COPD now and I was finding that my enjoyment of life, including smoking, was diminishing.
  
For about the last year before I quit, I found that if I only smoked the smokes I really wanted... you know, waiting until after the initial surge of habit/nic-fit... I could hone down my smoking to only 2-4 a day.  Banning inside smoking at home helped too, since going outside often involves dressing for the weather (we have no sheltered outside smoking spot).  Still, if I drank I smoked, and then regretted it the next day.  
  
Last year (2012), heading into the Xmas holidays I was thinking of once again trying to quit.  Perhaps after the holidays... maybe after my 48th birthday in February.  Then on Christmas, I caught a bad cold, perhaps even the flu, from my niece or nephew, and for a week I was fucked up.  Couldn't even smoke, because smokes tasted disgusting... plus they just made me cough more.  The next thing I knew, New Years had come and gone, and I was  10 days smoke free.  Rather than starting again, just to quit in a month, I decided to just go with it, cold turkey.
  
The first 3 months were hard.  I honestly didn't want to smoke, but I was angry and depressed a lot of the time.  Some of that might have had to do with the Winter doldrums, though.  I had to change my routines a bit, too.  Not so much partying, or when I did, leaving earlier than normal.  Got a bit hermit-y for a while there, but I'm mostly over it.  
  
I've gone 13 months without smoking now, and feel a lot better about myself, my health and life in general.  I can even have drinks in the presence of smokers, and feel no need at all to light up.   Now if I could only convince my wife to quit.
  
tl;dr  Got sick, couldn't/didn't want to smoke while I was sick... when I was well again, I found I had a stretch of non-smoking under my belt, so I just decided to go for it.  Cold turkey."Eventually I just didn't want to anymore. I guess I got lucky"To put it simply, I just got angry.  It was my third time to attempt, first two times with patches, and gum.  One day I came to the realization that I was angry with myself for putting me in the situation where I got sick two times a year for no reason other than smoking, and I was driving myself to an early grave smoking 2 packs a day.  I just quit and worked through it with no external stimuli.  It's been 7 years, and I've only had one cigarette in that time.""I quit both smoking and caffeine at the same time. Being a coffee addict too, this was doubly difficult.

The result was that I was too focused on the idea of not having caffeine, that the idea of not having cigarettes was being ""masked"" by that. I rewarded myself with Coca-Cola and espresso coffees after a week and felt great relief from that.""I truly wanted to quit.  I didn't do it because people told me I should;  I quit smoking because I wanted to.  After I established that mindset I bought a disposable e cig that lasted me a week.  I didn't replace it after it ran out but kept it as a pacifier to puff on when I had an urge to smoke.   

I still miss the feeling of smoke filling my lungs and still love the smell of fresh cig smoke  but enjoy my lack of hacking, nic fits, smokey clothes, heavy breathing more.  ""I quit smoking the day my son was born. I figured if I couldn't do it for him, then I couldn't do it. Haven't smoked a cigarette in 11 years despite constant exposure. 

The point is, you need to be ready you have to want to quit. Nothing works until you want it to. ""I started smoking when I was 13 as an occasional smoker and by the time I quit at 28 I was up to 40 cigarettes a day - and more when I was drinking.  I tried on several occasions to quit, but kept going back.  The only method I ever tried was cold turkey.  The only thing that did it for me was moving from Japan to Canada.  I was used to paying $2 for a pack and in Canada it was closer to $10.

6 years later, I still miss it, but I would never go back.  It was way too hard to quit and I don't want to have to go through that again.

I've heard that having a change in your life that alters your routines helps a lot.""I just stopped wanting to smoke, and I was one of the biggest addicts. I'd smoked since 13 years old. I was sitting at my PC and I looked at a cigarette in my hand and thought, this really is a fucking ridiculous habit, why do I still do it? I threw the pack in the bin and never wanted a cigarette again. That was 8 years ago now."http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbLe4EnmEMMoving from Eastern Europe to Western Europe. "Smoking 3 packs in one day, making sure i always had a smoke in my mouth all day, after that i puked and never smoked again
""Replace it with masturbating. This is what i did. Way more fucking rewarding. 
Only downside. I cant stop masturbating. ""Not being allowed to smoke in the house and living on the 4th floor with no elevator. 

Not being able to smoke at work and being on the 15th floor. 

Not being able to smoke in any public place, at all, ever.

Getting an x-ray from my doctor that noted pleural changes consistent with long-term smoking use and being told that in addition to my heart condition (SVT), if i kept smoking I'd probably be dead by 45. 

That, combined with my increasing inability to do things i like, like paintball, etc., was a no brainer. Once i *wanted* to quit, it was easy. It's *wanting* to quit that is hard for smokers - knowing you should sometimes ain't enough.""My Dad did it back in 2001ish so a lot of the stuff available now wasn't there for him.  However he tried everything available at the time, the patches, the therapy/ group shit, I can't remember the rest but I know he exhausted all options...  Eventually he just did it cold turkey but his trick was to tell himself that he wasn't quitting just taking a break and that on the day of his retirement he would go out, buy a pack and smoke them all.  He told me of another lady who did the same sort of thing but kept an unopened pack in a table in her foyer, just in case she wanted it and that she lost her shit a few years later when someone threw them out and she had to immediately run to the store for a new pack.  Just to have them...

He says that the first little while was the hardest and that he had days where he wanted to kill for a smoke but that after a while it got easier.  He can still tell instantly if someone enters the house and has had a smoke in the past 5 or 10 minutes though and is now really sensitive to cigarette smoke.  Its like a mild allergic reaction (sore throat, snotty nose, watery eyes) when he gets too close to it or is in a house where people have been smoking inside.

Good luck in quitting!  Or taking a long break from it, however you end up thinking about it...""Sorry if it's been said. But e cigs are becoming a great method for people to stop. They use vapor instead of smoke and a deliciously flavored liquid that only has nicotine in it. This means no carcinogens and because you aren't smoking, you're vaping, there isnt damage to teeth and lungs. The reason why these are good for quitting, is the liquid nicotine has different strengths. What you can do is start at the highest and slowly work your way down to 0mm nicotine. It's been incredibly effective with my friends and other colleagues. ""I'm on hour 63 as I type this.  What everyone has said is true.  You have to want it for reasons that are only personal to you.  Prep yourself for it though.  I have toothpicks or straws to knaw on.  Almonds and gum as well.  I take walks when I would normally smoke so I can still keep the habit but in a healthy way.  It also takes care of the trigger.  I am drinking lots of tea and water and trying to eat healthy items.  Try to stay away from caffeine and booze if possible as they will induce a trigger.  It really is easier than you think but the triggers are what really get ya.  Once you get past that momentary trigger you are good to go until the next one.

You can do it!  It really is easier than you think it will be.""Find a reason stronger than the addiction.  Vanity for me was never enough.   It should be personal and strong, sort of like a Petronas from Harry Potter.

The idea of my failing health when I am older and the inability to fully  interact with my son and wife.  Punishing them for my selfishness.   This was my mental image. 

I smoked from 12 to 27.  My 33 birthday is this week so been off for 5.5 years now.""I had ended up moving to another state.  I was in a place where I hadn't already had bad habits associated with certain places or activities.  I'd also left behind my family and friends, most of whom are smokers.  So, a new environment worked for me.""The most important thing is to UNDERSTAND that 90% of the things you love about smoking are things related to ADDICTION. You are addicted, and you go into drawback... similar to every other drugs...

For example: You talk about the breaks... I am a med-stundent, last year ( 6th )... and i do study a lot... I was afraid that smoke breaks are the only way to relax... THEYARE NOT!! Since i quitted smoking, i realised that i needed those brakes not to relax... but to smoke. You will NOT MISS THOSE BRAKES. If you really want the break, you could still fallow your collegues, or just do something else, like look through the window for a few minutes thinking,reflecting, meditating... not feeding and silencing an addiction.

How I really did it ?:

Well, Really wanted to quit.... Failed 100 times .... Read Alan Carr book.... Stopped trying to quit.... 1 year passed, and I said, I will go to the dentist, get my teeth cleaned on monday morning, get home and stop smoking because i WANT this, and because < Insert Alan Carr reasoning > ...cold turkey.

First 2 day: Nightmare... I was walking arround the house, doing nothing, i felt like shit... I woke up at night sweating

Day 3->5: I felt like smoking every 2 hours, but nothing compared to the first two days

Day 6->14 I felt like smoking maybe 3 times per day but i could ignore it faster

Day 14->Day 45: I felt like smoking maybe 1-2/day... But if i passed the initial impulse, the craving would go away.

It's been 3 months now and i almost don't feel like smoking at all with the only exception beeing when i go out at bars/ parties. But if i manage to say no at the first impulse, it goes away.

Hope this helps, good luck.
""Not me, but my husband. 

I was pregnant. He had a habit of smoking inside. We lived in Chicago and it was the middle of winter. I nagged him until he quit.

""My girlfriend of almost 2 years doesnt smoke.  I was a smoker for the last 14 years. I decided one morning I didnt want to smell that way anymore.  I didnt want her to kiss me with my smokey breath.  I started off by buying a E cig. The first 3 weeks sucked the most.  The E cig just wasnt giving me what I needed.  Then I started telling myself ""just stick with it, your body is kicking all those toxins of real cigarettes.ÛÏ  Before I knew it, I was craving less and less, up to today, where I have been smoke free for 6 months with zero cravings.  My best advice is you HAVE to be ready.  If you arent 100% committed and ready, I wouldnt try. Its always great ro have a support system.  My girlfriend was very encouraging and just one look at her beautiful face and I remembered why  was doing what I was doing"Running out of money works pretty well.Triggers. That is it.

Here's my key: It will feel shitty to not do it for a while. Then gradually it will feel really good to not do it. You have to make it over that hump. Once you do, you will wonder why you ever smoked in the first place. You will smell it on other people and it will be totally obnoxious. ""I smoked 7 years and then quit using will power alone over a 6 week period. Heres how. The first quit lasted a week. The second quit lasted a month, The third quit was forever. Here is the secret. There is only one thing that works: Practice. You have to practice any skill to be good at it, right? Well, quitting smoking is no exception.. You have to practice quitting smoking to be good at quitting smoking ?Ê_?Ê. You have to know how it's going to feel, what kind of emotions are going to come out. What it is like after a day, a week. Give yourself the space you need to experiment with a couple of practice quits. Analyze how you feel and react to circumstances and situations. Think deeply about how to overcome the negatives that are paired with those reactions. Once you know how your body and mind will react, then the real quit will be a breeze because you won't be succeptable to all those reactions that the ""cold turkey"" people aren't prepared for. Hope that helps ?Ê_?¡?Ä""I started smoking in 8th grade and quit at 26 years old.  

I read Allen Carr's Easyway To Stop Smoking.  I didn't quit because of the book, but I couldn't have quit without it.  A few weeks after reading, I had mouth surgery and couldn't smoke for a couple of days.  I realized that the book put me in the right mindset and this was the opportunity to quit cold turkey.

The first 2-3 days were pure hell and the first week wasn't a whole lot better.  You have to just suck it up and grind through the first week or two.  

After that, the chemicals are out of your system and it's purely a mental game.  Nicotine addiction isn't a very strong physical addiction, but mentally it is really tough.  I remember the amazingly cheesy, but useful acronym: N.O.P.E. - not one puff, ever.  We, as smokers, know that one puff will lead to two, which leads to a cigarette and eventually a pack.  If that wasn't the case, we never would have started smoking in the first place.  Maybe one day I can risk a smoke again, but I have a feeling that when that day comes I won't want to.

It has been 261 days since I last had a smoke.  I still periodically get ""cravings,"" but they are nothing like before.  They come every couple of days and I don't feel the cravings throughout my entire body.  They last for only a few seconds and I can brush them away like a fleeting thought.

tldr; Read book, sift through the bull shit feel good text and focus on the useful information.  Adjust mindset to one conducive to quitting (i.e., People were never meant to smoke.  Normal people are happy without cigarettes.  You will feel this some day).  Pick date to quit.  N.O.P.E.  Profit?""I just quit myself and not by any means you'd want to copy but maybe!  I went three days cold turkey and just before I could cave in and smoke I got the flu.  That made me not able to physically smoke for like a week and a half so that point I had gone two weeks.  I still maybe burn one with my buds if we're severally inebriated but that's it.  No smoking at work, no smoking in the car or daytime in general.  I wish you luck sir and if you truly run out of ideas just go ahead and get some influenza. "my wife smoked for 30 years.  She used the patch to quit.  She tried chantix several years ago but it made her too nauseated to stay on it.Pulmonary embolism"I quit cold turkey. Just stopped smoking one day, and that was it. I myself didn't ever have cravings, or need one as some people do when they wake up, after a meal, etc. I have also been able to avoid it when drinking. Just not my bag anymore. I quit because I wanted to, I used to enjoy it. I have nothing against anyone who does smoke, I just wanted to do it for myself, for now and the future. Three years btw.""Early days here, 2 months, but it was a health scare unrelated to smoking. I was stuck in the hospital during winter and the thought of going outside for a smoke was too much. Plus I had a bunch of other things going on so that was a distraction. They offered the patch, but I declined. The morphine and diazepam seemed to be enough. I still crave a cigarette, but not nearly as much as the first few weeks. I have been good about rewarding myself with all the extra money I have to keep motivated. I am pretty certain it will stick this time. It is not easy, but the benefits become tangible and you need to reinforce your mind with them. A little known fact my doctor told me about quitting is that you are more prone to illness like colds for the first year. Something to do with your body chemistry being messed up. There are still plenty of good and essential reasons to butt out.""I still love smoking.  I started when I was 16.  Smoked pack a day to age 21 or so.  Quit cold turkey for about 4 years.  Started up again for a year because I moved and it was a way to make friends (talking outside a bar and smoking).  Quit cold turkey again for another 8 years.  Recently traveled internationally and smoked 1/2 pack a day for the 15 days I was gone bc fuck it, I was on vacation and just it seemed necessary given the circumstances.  Quit cold turkey before boarding airplane home.  Haven't smoked since and it's been 6 months or so.

I don't know why I am able to quit so easily.  Those first 48-72 hours can be tough.  After that it's all a mind game.  What it really comes down to though is that you will always love the idea of smoking (it's relaxing, it's social, it's cool), but your desire to smoke is all in your head.  It's easy to convince yourself to do it.  What you have to do is develop resolve.  Firm, unflinching resolve.  Make the choice and stick with it.  Patches, pills, hypnosis are all unnecessary and I think only serve as a crutch, not a solution.  You have it in yourself to just quit.  It's so easy to not purchase cigarettes.  You have to recognize the urge and beat it to death in your mind, each and every day for the rest of your life.  You will NEVER not have the urge in the future.  It will always come back.  My dad told me he smoked for less than 2 years in college, and even then, not like I did (pack a day).  He was an amateur smoker.  He says that after a really great meal, with a nice glass of wine, he still gets the urge to light up and he hasn't smoked in 40 years.  Accept this fact.  When the urge comes on you, distract yourself.  Look at yourself in the mirror and say, not today.  Immerse yourself in work.  You don't need a break when working.  You can work through that shit.  I promise you, each day it gets a little easier.  It will always take work though.  I'm writing this and I'm like, yea, cigarette sounds good.  Once I hit save, I'm not smoking because, when it comes down to it, I really don't want to smoke, and neither do you.  Get in your head and beat that demon to death and then go out and enjoy life.  All the best...""When cigarettes broke the $3.00 a pack cost, I realized with my pack a day habit it was costing me about $100.00 a month. 

I handed the pack back, kept my $3.00 and never smoked again.

Sit down and figure out how much it's costing you, and find something that you REALLY want that you could spend that money on. "This doesn't answer your question but I recently quit dipping tobacco. What helped me was coffee pouches. A popular brand is getgrinds.com. Those that do chew or dip try this stuff it's great"I was just listening to a RadioLab show (it's a podcast/NPR radio show) and there was a woman on there who made a deal with a friend that if she ever smoked again she would donate $5000 to the KKK. The woman was a civil rights activist and obviously super anti-KKK so this was making the negative side effect of smoking something that would be realized in the short term instead of something that could be justified away.

[Here](http://www.radiolab.org/story/117291-you-v-you/) is a link to the episode, they'll obviously explain it much better than I can."marriage"I quit by replacing cigarettes with something else while doing a specific activity.  In my case, I played EverQuest all the damn time and smoked 2 packs a day, Marlboro Reds too!  I replaced my cigs with Krispy Kreme donuts.  After I chewed down a dozen in one day, I didn't pick up smoking again after that.

To this day I cannot eat a Krispy Kreme, but it's not so bad.  I saved my lungs :)""I made up a little reward system for myself. When I decided to quit smoking, I had just picked up DJing as a hobby. This was back before computers and CD players were common, so records were the only way to go, and were expensive as hell. I basically made a deal with myself that every time I went three days without having a cigarette, I would by myself a new record. This essentially represented the money that I would have been spending on cigarettes had I been smoking. I would often 'save up' my money from not smoking, and then hit a record store at the end of the month and buy myself a big stack of fresh new records. as a broke student, it was really satisfying to watch my record collection grow much faster than it otherwise would have.

The great thing is that if you slip up, you don't start again from scratch. You just don't get to treat yourself to whatever replacement you pick that week. I don't think I actually slipped up once.

tl;dr: find yourself something that costs about the same as smoking that you can buy yourself regularly, but wouldn't otherwise be able to afford.""Dude, same boat. I gave up smoking for the new year and it is so goddamn hard. Best friends smoke, half my coworkers smoke, family smokes. Its everywhere. I have three weeks without a slip up and it's killing me. 

Edit: Mobile missed a few words.""Stop buying cigarettes. It's hard, but it's the only way.""E cigarette, all the benefits of nicotine without the smoke. You may want to head over to /r/electronic_cigarette  . There are good electric cigarettes and bad ones. ""It's simple. If you're looking for similar alternatives to smoking a cigarette, you're gonna end up going back to it sooner or later. This is why I never tried e-cigarettes. I stopped as soon as I moved into my first apartment with my wife. I even made sure it had a balcony where I could smoke my cigarettes. A day or two after moving in I got really sick and had a sore throat for days. This kept me away from cigarettes for a few days. As soon as I recovered, I decided I didn't want to smoke anymore. The sickness may have not been related to smoking in the first place, but subconsciously it made me think I was more vulnerable to it because of smoking. I threw away a brand new carton I had recently bought and haven't smoked in over 6 months. Your body quickly learns to refuse it and even the smell starts to annoy you.
tl;dr : got sick, blamed it on smoking, haven't smoked since. ""Wellbutrin. Took it for depression, stopped smoking the first day I was on it and never started again. To this day I'm not even sure what happened, I just stopped."smoking weed (a lot of it) for two weeks.Decided to wait until tomorrow to have my next cigarette. I haven't given up.

I had tried twenty times before and the only thing that was really different was that in my head I knew it was over.  All of the other times I had said I would quit for two weeks or a month and then...  This time I knew it was forever.  I think you really have to want it and most smokers don't.  That is why they fail."Simple. Wanting to, then deciding to. Once those two things are in place, it isn't too hard. Don't beat yourself up if you have one, or fall back in to the habit. Learn your triggers, move on and correct course. Took me about a year to be smoke free, but it worked better than lying to myself or beating myself up."You have to want it. Also it helps to remember that you are owned by only your thoughts."I have some tips for you I got from a stop smoking ""class"" which worked for me.  This was to wean us off them without the panic some feel of just quitting cold turkey.

Keep and index card and rate how bad you want one from 1-4, 4 being the most

Smoke something you don't normally smoke such as non-menthol if you smoke menthol, light cigarettes in you smoke regulars and don't ever buy your favorite.  Get the worst cigarettes you can.

Keep your cigaretts and/or lighter in another room, the fridge, your car so you have to get up and think about getting one

Stike a match and blow it out slowly.  (This was a real comfort to me!)

Drink a glass of water

Brush your teeth

Keep in mind my way worked for me and might not you.
I started about 6 months before actually quitting.  I stopped buying cigs and started bumming off people.  By not having my own cigs around I eliminate my ability to smoke of my own free will.  I only smoked when other people were around.  After about 4 months of buying cigs off of friends I started buying my own packs again but was much better at waiting between cigs and wasnt chain smoking.  Then once winter hit I got my yearly cold/flu (LIKE CLOCKWORK) and I just quit cold turkey.  Since I was already suffering due to the flu I wasnt even concerned about cigarettes.  I havent had a single puff since 10/30/13.  I feel great and its getting easier to curb cravings by the day.  Its nice because you can really feel your progress as the chest feeling I would get when I wanted a cigarette gets less and less powerful by the day""Electronic cigarettes, smoked for 21 years.

Everyone around me who has read this book has quit smoking, including my two pack a day husband. It sounds weird but I gave it a shot and it worked. I have been smoking from the age of 12 and quit 2 months ago (I am 30) without giving it a second thought.
Good luck! ""What made me quit was the panic I felt one day, when I jogged up a regular flight of stairs and felt I might collapse from breathlessness. This would be normal at 50, not 22.""One day I woke up and just said ""... nah."" Haven't smoked again since. It's been two years""I smoked for 13 years. The only thing that got me to quit was I needed surgery and doctor said he wouldn't operate until I had been nicotine free for at least six weeks. Doctor said
 nicotine also causes incision site and scars to not heal well and I could end up with weepy, lumpy, horrible scars. Unfortunately, it took the idea if nasty scars and infection to get me to quit. After not smoking for 6 weeks and then an additional six months healing/recovery of not being able to smoke, I just kept not smoking."I taught myself how to cook while I was quitting as a distraction. I also bought dollar store lollipops to have when I was among my smoker friends. Just going through he motions of smoking without the cigarette helped significantly."a purpose to do so, cold turkey. I end up thinking ""why should I ruin my workout progress by ruining my lungs?""""Don't know if it would help, but I quit cold turkey on January 1st, 2011. I was currently enlisted in the USMC and was deployed to Sangin, Afghanistan. After every firefight or finding an IED (whether from it detonating or finding it beforehand), it was almost a ritual to smoke. One day I just decided that smoking isn't helping. So I just quit. 

My thought at the time was that if I could quit smoking here, I can quit smoking anywhere. ""I changed the way I thought about smoking after reading this book.  4 months as a non-smoker and it's been a breeze.  still do all the things I did before, just now I do them as a non-smoker.  http://www.theeasywaytostopsmoking.com/""I was prescribed Welbutrin because my mental health history made Chantix pretty much off limits. 

It is the only thing that made me 'not want to' smoke. I would think about it, think I would want one, have a slight urge and then when I would either begin to light up I would change my mind, or I would take one puff and not 'like' it. 

I can't really explain what about it did it, or how it really worked. All I know is I tried everything from the gum to E-Cigs and nothing worked. 

Welbutrin worked and it will 3 years in July for me. ""A friend and I both wanted to quit tobacco. He used to chew and I would smoke. We decided that the best way for us to quit was if we made an agreement. We decided that if one of us caught the other using tobacco, we would punch them in the balls. I got hit three times before I finally kicked the habit.

I don't know if you need to go with my method, but I think it's helpful to have someone else quitting with you so you're both going through it together.""After several failed attempts, I realized that my fate was going to be determined by my success or failure to quit. I think looking at what it does to people's skin really changed me. I began using a nicotine free e-cig, and that worked really well for me. I still went outside with the smokers, but I was not smoking. I cheated occasionally for a month, but that quickly stopped. The entire time, my roommate smoked, as did a few people I work with. 

Glad to see cold turkey worked for others, it didn't for me.""I only succeeded because my bullshitting friend who 'quit' every other week said this was the last time he would quit and that he would never smoke again, i told him i would aswell and that he wouldnt last as long as me. 3 years down the line the fuckers still smoking, and i make a point of it everytime i see him.

The difficult bit is resisting the trigger to smoke long enough to let it pass. This is usually three to five minutes and in the beginning it feels like forever. But after the first two weeks, it becomes easier. The only way to quit is to watch out for and recognize triggers.""You have to want to. I just stopped, and have not looked back since.""Heres my story! 

I started smoking around 18. did it for about 2 years. at that point, I decided I wanted to stop smoking. So I started dipping. I dipped for a short time, but then went back to smoking. Eventually I went back to dipping tobacco for the next few years. I stopped dipping this past Thanksgiving. I went the e-cig way. Used it about 2 weeks when it stopped working so I said to hell with it. Haven't dipped since thanksgiving 2013 and haven't smoked in a few years.

After trying just about every method in the book (patches, gum, Chantix, aromatherapy, lozenges, e-cig, Allan Carr's book), one day I just got fed up with myself and quit smoking. Drinking out of my ash can one sleepy morning helped.

When I finally managed it, I used patches but I'd used them before without success. What really mattered was seriously wanting to quit. I had either bronchitis or pneumonia every winter for 10 years, I was underweight, sick of the smell of smoke on everything and finally got fed up with it all. To top it off, this was during the lead up to a $1/pack tax increase in my state.

I snacked quite a bit and avoided people as much as possible when I was feeling grumpy. I also started a project that I knew I couldn't finish until I was over the worst of the quitting; I typed out all 7 of the Harry Potter books, word for word. American editions and British editions.

I also turned my attention to working out A LOT! I think this helped to have another place to channel my frustrations. Also, having a partner who was very understanding when I got cranky (that word is an understatement) and was supportive of the situation. 

One thing I can say for sure, a year later I don't crave smoking any more (which took about 2-3 months) and I feel sooo much better about myself and what I've accomplished.

Nicotine is a very weak drug. It's the habit of smoking that you crave.
Identify your triggers and be ready for them. For me it was golfing and driving. I still did those things but knowing I would want to smoke helped be ready.
Last thought. My worst cravings would only last a couple of minutes. I can handle most anything for a couple of minutes. Once you resist the first craving of the day, the rest are easier. Build on that."Realizing the contented feeling of balance I got after a cigarette was what non-smokers felt like ALL THE TIME.The best method to quit smoking or any other bad habits is to not start in the first place."Very helpful!

As a lot of people here have said, there's no trick. You just have to have a good reason to want to stop and enough will power to see it through.
 I slowly weened myself off cigarettes one at a time by breaking the habit of smoking.  Like I'd stop smoking after I ate.  Then wouldn't have one after I woke up. 
The hardest one to quit is the smoke while taking a shit.

It was probably my 5th time quitting but it was successful because I had a real fear motivating me.  My health is more important than smoking - it felt like a flip switched in my brain.  

For most people, it does take many many tries at quitting to be successful.  Keep trying!! ""I started lap swimming.  I'd heard about a guy that quit by doing 50 sit-ups every time he wanted a cigarette.  After 50 sit-ups, he didn't want a cigarette anymore.  Eventually, he just stopped smoking.  I did something similar, but with lap swimming instead.  The desire to breathe won-out against my desire for a cigarette and I quit."I was in a medical coma and paralyzed. Haven't smoked since. Chew the filter. You'll get disgusted putting a cigarette near your mouth.I quit because it was supposed to help us conceive. Used zyban which worked. Two weeks later found out my partner was pregnant. Thought about the example I wanted to set him and have never smoked since. "It took me two years of effort to quit.  I tried nicotine gum, patches, and lozenges unsuccessfully. I eventually came to realize quitting sucked and nothing I used was going to change that, there was no easy way out, I just had to suck it up and quit.  As soon as I accepted the fact that no matter what I used (or even if I used nothing) I was going to want to smoke everyday for the foreseeable future and would just have to say no I was able to quit.  I had to accept my life would suck ass for a while and just deal with it.  On my final and successful attempt I did use the patch, which for me seemed to work better than the other replacement therapies, to help.  But ultimately what made the difference between that attempt and the 4-5 unsuccessful attempts that came before it was my mental approach.  ""I chewed tobacco to deal with the cravings.  I only got through one can of the stuff because it was really disgusting.  I felt like it helped and I didn't ever feel addicted to the chewing tobacco.  

It's a cheap alternative to the nicotine gum :)"I became very aware of how disgusting it made me smell and concentrated on the fact that everyone would know and think less of me for it. The fact that it makes teeth yellow also was a motivating factor for me. Social pressure is an exceptionally strong motivator. "In 2005, I was having a smoke and talking to my wife one morning and just passed out. Got hauled to the hospital. Turns out it was cardiac arrhythmia. No more cigarettes. Tried a pipe for a couple of years. Enjoyable - fussing with it is almost as much fun as smoking it - but it was really messy and I still knew I needed to quit.

So I bought some gum and patches and put them in the medicine cab. Months passed. One morning I woke up and said ""I need to quit NOW."" If I hadn't had the patches already on hand, I probably would have caved in.

The low dose patch gives you more nicotine than you get from the pipe so I only needed them for a couple of days.


Everybody's different but switching to a pipe and having the patches on hand for just the right moment did it for me.

Thanks for asking, OP. I'm hoping to stop biting my nails, so some of these tips should help. Good luck quitting!""You have to quit when you're ready to quit. I know that sounds like kind of a cop-out, but it's not. If you try to quit because your girl wants you to, or somebody else says you should, it'll never stick. You just have to decide that you're done. Cold turkey really is the best way to go. Don't waste your time on patches, e-cigs, anything like that. Just stop.

I know I'm kind of parroting what every other response in here is saying, but that's because it's true. When you're really ready to quit, you will, and there won't be any stopping you.

You can do it, you should do it, and you will do it. Just remember, it's all in your head. Day three is the hardest. After that, it's smooth sailing.

Good luck OP!""Cold Turkey. Like most here I picked a date and took a vacation from work to lessen as many triggers as I could. That was 6 months ago and I haven't looked back.

Tl;dr get a gal stone lodged in your pancreatic duct and by the time you're out of the hospital you'll be cured. ""I quit a few times before but I quit one month ago and I am 100% committed and convinced that this was my last ""try"". What was different about this one was: 

1) My mental state. I feel like I was ready to quit this time. I wasn't smoking a lot but enough to notice. I was tired of stinking like cigarettes all the time and figuring out where or when I could smoke.

2) I quit with my wife and our best friend. Doing it together really helped. It keeps me accountable. If I smoke again, I'm letting my friend and wife down big time. 

3) This one is short term. But weed. WEED. My buddy and I took two Friday and Monday off from work and quit on Thursday night. We hung out for a good part of the 4 day weekend and whenever we got pissed or angry or really had bad cravings (worst for the first 3 days) we smoked a joint. That shit fucking works. Mostly because you stop getting pissed (a real problem for both of us when we quit) and the craving goes away. It just sort of chills you out for those first few days and distracts you from the physical withdraw. It's not a perfect solution but it honestly helped a lot. 

It's only been a month but like I said, I am totally comfortable with saying that I'll never smoke again. So much stuff has already improved. I can smell better and don't get out of breath as easy. I don't smell like shit all the time. It's pretty awesome. 

Good luck!""I was at our cabin in the mountains. I went down for an early morning walk by the lake and on my way back going up the stairs to the cabin I was a little short of breath and I could taste cigarettes, the kicker was that I had forgotten to grab my smokes on the way out so I hadn't smoked since the night before. It made me realize how bad that stuff really is for you if it can just linger like that. Just like that I grabbed my pack and threw it in the garbage. I was in the worst mood of my life for about two weeks but I made it though. I struggled a bit because my wife (fiancee then) was a social smoker so she would have the occasional ciggy when friends were over or we went out and for me it was always all in or all out, it used to bother me a lot because then i could smell it on her and i didn't like it. Anyway I made it without patches or anything and 5 years later I'm still smoke free and I don't miss it except maybe for the social aspect of it. I work at an office so smoking was a good way to step back from things and take a break until you realize that other people are finding ways to do this without inhaling toxic fumes. Go for a quick walk around the office or grab coffee or tea. Go talk to a coworker for a moment. Quitting is hard but it's harder to be a smoker. Think of all the $ you'll save on the long run!""My dad went on walks daily to get his mind off of it.

I felt good for a while, didn't really want to smoke anymore, then I had a bad breakup and started smoking again.  
It wasn't until I got pregnant I made the decision on my own I would never smoke again. I have no urge to start again because I don't want my son to ever see me smoking and think it's okay to do or have to suffer any health issues because of me.  
Now I run 30 miles a week and can sit through an entire movie without having to go outside for a smoke break, and I can't imagine ever going back. Sure, I feel left out when my friends go outside at the bar to have a smoke, but I also have someone depending on me to be a good role model and I think that's what helps me most."ZYBAN!!! It works (Ibupropion)"i stopped smoking immediately and started to smoke weed, it was quite easy :)""I quit after 17 years via cold turkey / acupuncture.  It was amazingly easy. BUT, I wanted to quit.  This is key.  
Acupuncture was very effective.  The guy who did it was from China (lives in Canada).  He explained that nicotine suppresses and replaces dopamine in your brain (the stuff that keeps you calm).  Over time the nicotine turns off the dopamine 'drip feed' you would normally have.  However, nicotine is metabolized with 20min or so, hence frequent cravings for a cigarette.  That feeling that 'somethings wrong...'.

So the acupuncture is meant to kick start your pituitary gland forcing it to release dopamine again.  I walked in having already had 4 cigarettes that morning.  Walked out with a huge dopamine rush and never smoked again.  Over 14 years ago.  ""Not me, but my mom:

Good luck sir or madam ""For me, it was all in my head and more habitual than an addiction.

I could go days or week without a smoke, but then remember I smoked and will go get some. I tried quitting several times and have failed because I would buy them and realize I shouldn't then start smoking anyway.

For me, this solution was the one that worked for me:

Once I made the decision to quit, I bought a pack of smokes and put them in the freezer, where I could easily spot them.

The reasoning behind this is simple:

If I have a craving for a smoke, get dressed to go out, get to the store, I am GOING to buy them because of the effort it took to get here.

With the pack in the freezer and easily accessible, I get a craving, I head to the fridge and by the time I get there, I have talked myself out of them. Since I didn't really put forth too much effort, I didn't have the feeling of ""Fuck it, I worked to get here so I'm not going to let it go to waste"".

That worked for me, at least. I know it's not for everyone, but just put it out there.

Story about a friend.

A friend of mine's mom smoked. A LOT. She was wheelchair bound and unable to go get them herself so relied on my friend. She wanted to get her mom to stop smoking and heard from someone the following:

Get a Horse Hair brush. Pluck a hair. Insert it into smoke. Wait.

All of the sudden, her mom noticed that they just didn't taste the same or taste good anymore. She tried a few more out of the pack and decided that since she can't handle the taste, she won't smoke anymore.

That was 20+ years ago, and she is still smoke free. :D""Persistence and will power.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  I don't think any habitual smoker ever actually quits; you just stop smoking for a while.  Sometimes is a long while.  I'm now 11 years into my longest attempt to stop smoking and there are still moments when I feel like ""lighting up"" but then I think ""I like being able to walk up the stairs without wheezing"", and the Dragon goes dormant.  Just keep quoting and eventually it will stick.

Good luck""Electronic cigarettes, all the way. Which brand do you have? If you're using the cheap ones like the Blu cigarettes or some of the more basic models, that may be the problem. I tried to quit using those before and it ended up making me smoke MORE because I was so frustrated! They would break all the time, plus the vapor didn't actually feel like a cigarette. I have since purchased a really nice mechanical mod and it's been almost six months since I smoked my last cigarette. The vapor production on my mod is incredible - it's even better than a real cigarette! Not only did I quit, but I'm 100% I could never go back. Why would I want my mouth to taste like I just licked an ashtray when I could have key lime pie or bacon & waffles?! My body feels better, plus I didn't have to go outside to smoke a cig when it was -15 outside - HUGE plus!!! Over the last few months, I went from 24 mg of nicotine to using 4mg. I'm almost completely off it! :) The best part is that you don't have to change everything at once. Every time I would quit smoking before, it seemed painfully overwhelming. Not only was I quitting smoking, but I would also have to change my entire lifestyle. My in-laws smoke over a pack a day, inside and outside of their house. It was a struggle to see them, or to hang out with all of my friends because they continued to smoke. With the e-cig, I can still hang out with them. Honestly, I just sort of feel bad for them. As a smoker, you have NO idea how bad it stinks or how strongly it can affect other people. I can now hang out with those same people even if I've left my e-cig at home simply because the desire to smell and taste those nasty things is completely gone. I wish you the best of luck on your quit journey. If you have any questions or need some more information, please feel free to PM me!! I believe in you!""I haven't gone through all the replies, so I'm not sure if this has been said, but it isn't near the top and I think it should be.

This won't work for everyone, and I don't know where the term comes from or who to credit, but I think of it as self actualization.  Sounds fancy, maybe silly, but I promise it works for some, as it did me.

Quitting/stopping is task, and as a task is is something that maybe doesn't work.  It is also, importantly, something a smoker, ie a person who smokes, does.

What worked for me after failing to quit a few times, was not to keep trying to quit, but to try to be a non-smoker.  Quitting smoking identifies you on some level as a smoker.  I decided from on this day, and for as long as I could, I was going to be a non-smoker.  Essentially I went cold turkey for a while, but allowed myself to slip.  If I slipped I slipped, but then I would go back to being a non-smoker.

Try that.  Try to imagine what a non-smoking version of you is, does.  When you feel urges, ask yourself, am I going to be a non-smoker, or a smoker here.  And DON'T beat yourself up if you decide to be a smoker for a day, or an evening.  Life is full of choices, you get to make them, own them.  And tomorrow you get to make more choices, different ones if you like.  

That might be the most important part - don't worry if you slip.  That leads you to a shame spiral that ends up with you being a full time smoker again.  Don't worry if you slip.  So what if you have a few beers and buy a pack.  Wake up in the morning, and decide to be a non-smoker again, for that day, or for as long as you can be.  Throw out the cigarettes, or give them away.  

Eventually you'll find yourself being a non-smoker more than being a smoker, and soon enough you'll be a non-smoker 100% of the time.  Or at least 99% of the time.  I consider myself a non-smoker, but I might have one once or twice a year.  :)  ""Not me but a good story about my Grandmother and my Uncle. When he was in high school she caught him smoking Pot and told him he had to quit. He told her as long as she smoked cigarettes (she had her whole life, he didn't smoke cigarettes) he would continue smoking pot and she had no right to tell him otherwise. She said okay, threw her pack away and never smoked again. He never smoked Pot again. It all ended, just like that.""I tried to quit a couple times, then starting again after a couple of months. Last time, I really just got disgusted with myself that I was starting again and I just realized that every single cigarette I had, I was just poisoning myself. That thought more than anything helped me quit.""Patches and a supportive SO were the best things for me! Also I told everybody, friends and family that I was quitting so I felt an obligation to them! Also DO NOT smoke e-cigs. They have a lot of nicotine and and mainly just nicotine so it does not help the cravings. When the battery dies and you still want to smoke, cigs are much easier to get. Just take it day-by-day, good luck! :)""One of my best friends committing suicide.  Not because I was so torn up from it that I quite, either.  I had largely cut smoking from my life, but whenever I went to his place (which was often, as I played music with him in a band, and jammed as a two piece quite often), I would light up there.  It got to where this was the only time I smoked.  So when he died, my only enabler was gone from my life and at that point, it was very easy to quit for good."Sheer. Fucking. Willpower."I made a commitment to stop buying them. From there I just got used to smoking less and less since if I wanted one I needed to bum one. Eventually it got to a point where I just didn't feel like smoking any more, the craving was gone. I do still have the occasional smoke once in a blue moon when I'm partying or am incredibly stressed but I consider myself a non smoker. I'd say I smoke about 4-6 times a year now.""I smoked for 33 years and I liked it. I quit several times, but I always gained weight. Since I liked smoking, I would always go back to it after a while for ""weight management."" In July this year, a close friend of mine turned me onto e-cigs, the vapor kind. I quit that day without expecting to or actually trying. I haven't looked back. I haven't craved cigarettes. I haven't gained weight. For the first time in 33 years, I have turned a corner. I still don't crave them when I smell someone else smoking. Instead, I want to share my experience with everyone I encounter. I feel better, I smell better, and I have saved a ton of money!

If you don't decide that you want to be a non-smoker rather than a smoker, no drug, device, program, gimmick, or therapy will make you quit because in your mind you still want to be a smoker. So, don't look for alternatives or frustrate yourself by ""trying"" to quit. Make up your mind that you don't want to be a smoker anymore, and then simply stop.

The it was really just an hour by hour thing. I was thrilled when I finally hit 3 days, but I also remember at that point that getting to a week seemed impossible. When I hit a week, I was terrified of facing the next week. After 14 days it was getting somewhat easier, but I still reached for them and got depressed when they weren't there. It took about 3 months before I realized I wasn't thinking about them any more. ""I had jury duty. The jury selection pool was gigantic. Maybe 100 people. The plaintiff was this old man whose wife had died. He was suing JC Reynolds, lorrilard, and the other big cig company. The voire dire went on for over a week and consisted entirely of asking the potentials if they smoke, for how long, why'd they start etc. By day 4 it felt like a smoker's annonymous group. But one of the consistent things i noticed was the age people tried quitting was directly proportional to their success. Anyone who stopped before ~30 was able to quit for good. 

I got sick the next month and took the opportunity to stop. It's been just over 2 years. ""Cold turkey here, brah. Let me tell you my story.

I had three smokes left in a pack, about 2 hours left in my shift, and a day off the next day. I looked at them and decided I was going to have one now, one on my way home, and one before bed, and that's it. I didn't want to spend the money anymore, I didn't want to smell like it, and having a passion for cooking, I wanted to know what my food REALLY tasted like. 

That was all I needed. It's been roughly six months, and I still have very vivid dreams where I'm smoking. I feel the nicotine rush in my head, I feel the smoke hitting my lungs, I feel it as I breathe out, I taste it in my mouth, and I can smell it. 

It gets easier. This was my third attempt at quitting in 7 years of smoking, by far the most successful. Never stop trying to quit. You'll know when you're ready. Keep lots of sugar free gum on hand, drink tons of water and keep your mind occupied. You can do this!
""Fiance wouldn't sleep with me if I was smoking. Been smoke-free for going on 7 years now. If she ever left me, I'd light up in a second. ""Get the patch and every time you want to smoke repeat in your head the mantra ""the urge to smoke will pass"". When you use gum, dissolvables, e-cigs etc you're just replacing the habit. I have some triggers like my friends and drinking whiskey/beer but I'm 16 days in and down to the 14mg patch. I took the 21mg for 2 weeks and bought a box of 14 of the 14mg Equate brand from Walmart for $25.96. Only side effect is you might feel some numbness the first few times and nauseous. 

It's really worth it, I love laying in bed not needing a smoke when I wake up.""For me, electronic cigarette worked like a charm. 
I still smoke weed now and then though. "Marrying a nurse"I decided to start partying less and lift weights and run more, and so quitting smoking was kinda natural. I kept saying to myself: ""Smoking ain't going to help you with the other stuff, it is going to set you back actually"" so I just quit right there and then. I think it helped that I could feel my body rapidly increasing in performance and better sleep etc. 
The trick must be to fill the void with something else, like sports or as many of the other posts here mentions, fatherhood.  ""For me it was simply getting to the point where I was **actually** ready to quit. I'm sure other people are mentioning The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allan Carr, that book really helped me.

-You will have some cravings to smoke, if you're prepared and don't dwell on them, they're really easy to get past.

-Don't keep yourself addicted to nicotine. Don't replace smoking with nicotine gum, chew, e-cigs, the patch. Why prolong it? The physical addiction is done after about three days, after that, it's all the mental addiction.

-Don't hold on to the idea of smoking on special occasions (New Year's, your birthday, when drinking). Once you've actually stopped, you won't want to anyways.

-Make it part of a lifestyle change. I started exercising more and eating better at the same time I stopped smoking. It was a small part of a big change and didn't seem so daunting. For some strange reason my biggest cravings came after cardio exercise, drinking a lot of water put those to rest pretty easily.

-Don't let a fear of failure stop you from trying to quit. You're not going to be any worse off for trying to stop smoking, so you have nothing to lose.""I was, for a long time, someone who could pick up and quit smoking easily. But even when I wanted to stop my hardest part of it was when I had coworkers that smoked or friends. For a stretch in grad school I was actually hooked but never more than a pack a week (I helped ensure that by buying Dunhill). But it really comes down to willpower and realizing that not smoking feels better than the instant gratification of smoking. ""I used to smoke for 5 years and a heavy smoke at that. One night my father and I were drinking (I drink like once a year if that). That night when I was drinking I got really drunk, close to poisoning myself I threw up in the bathroom that night before passing out. Well anyways the next morning my stomach was hurting so bad that I could not eat or drink anything without throwing it up immediately. I even tried to smoke a cigarette and my body rejected it as well. I took that chance to quit, because my body wasn't craving it and it tasted so bad. So I guess you could say I quit cold turkey. The withdrawals were terrible I had negative thoughts, random rages of anger, and a lot of stress. So I guess try getting drunk to the point where your body rejects everything the next day. So far I have been nicotine free for a 1 year and 2 months. I can't tell you how much life is better with out having to smoke every 10 minutes. Good luck buddy!""I saw a family pulling up to a convenience store filled with smoke and with stained windows.  Dad jumps out of car, buys carton of cigs.  Before he is  back in the car, he has that carton skinned and and is distributing packs to his wife and two kids (kids may have been old enough to smoke, not sure).  Each voraciously tears into their own pack to square up.

Key to quiting:  Told myself that I will never end up like that or raise my kid like that.  Quit cold turkey.  Trust me, the first 3 months were brutal.  Probably the best thing I had going for me was a girlfriend that was a hopeless smoker.  She didn't believe that I could quit and would try to knock me off of my base in moments of weakness.  It just made me stronger.  I also changed my habits for the first 3 months.  Had to quit drinking until I could get over the edge.  Kept an open pack in my car and had conversations with them.  I know it sounds silly, but personifying the thing that you are trying to quit helps to evoke feeling of defiance and pride.  Don't underestimate it.

The period from 3-6 months was critical.  Not feeling the burn anymore. It would be very easy to say, ""let me try one and see what happens.""  Stayed the course and kept with the things that were working.  Started drinking again, but kept it in moderation to both get used to doing it without smoking and also careful not get myself into a drunken moment of weakness.

6-12 months:  Things are moving downhill.  I was able to drink socially without worrying about relapse.  I started to enjoy the health benefits of quiting.  I felt better.  I stopped coughing up sticky brown phlem.  I started to get my endurance back.  I had confidence that I was going to make it.

Anniversary FTW.  Never looked back.""Me and my friend had been trying to quit for a while. We were sitting in his car one night and decided to make a bet - whoever smokes a cigarette first owes the other $50. Three or four days went by and he cracked. It was his buddy's birthday and they got drunk, he needed one, blah blah...  I went in for double or nothing and forgave his debt, which worked for another week or so and then he, again, cracked. I went in for yet another double or nothing and we've been clear and free for over a month. Apparently a cigarette isn't worth owing a close friend $200.""After not smoking for a while, that first cigarette tastes/feels horrible. I kept focusing on how unrewarding it would be to have the next one.""Usually bronchitis helps :p I got it and promptly stopped smoking cold turkey, it was either watch gross black shit come out of me every time I coughed or quit. ""The comedian Jim Norton credits Colin Quinn (alleged comedian) with giving him a single piece of advice that helped him stop smoking:


""Whether or not you smoke a cigarette, the craving will eventually pass.""


Thinking of that helps me avoid smoking when I'm around smokers and get the old urge."I met the woman I knew I was going to marry.  Figured she wouldn't be interested in a guy that smoked....so I just stopped.  That was 7 years ago.  Married her last October and haven't had a smoke since the first day I saw her."What kind of ecig do you have? If it the same size as a cigarette you need to upgrade. Look into ego batteries w/ clearomizers.  They're rechargeable and refillable. You can buy hundreds of different flavors, and the vapor is much better. After the initial investment of a couple batteries and tanks I spend $15-30 per month now."Stop drinking"It was a lot of things, but I remember looking in the mirror one day and realizing my teeth and gums looked and felt disgusting. At some point you just have to make a cost-benefit analysis and have the willpower to stick to it. Is that little nicotene buzz really important enough to permanently fuck up your health? For some people it is, for me it wasn't.""I read The Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Alan Carr and I haven't had a smoke in 5 years and have had no desire for one since.  For it to work though, I think you really gotta follow his rules.  My friends who did that quit, my friend's that didn't fell back in.  He of course has lots of testimonial stuff to try to sell you on the idea so if that stuff turns you away like me, you have to look past it to get to the meat of things.  Either way, worked great!""I just got sick of trying to cover up the smell to maintain a professional image at school.

I have also found not watching movies/tv shows that are heavy on smoking is good too.  I can't watch Boardwalk Empire anymore cause it makes me think about smoking all of the time.

I like the nicotine gum too.  Get a slight buzz and get the oral stimulation that a cigarette in your mouth gives."Picked a date. I allowed myself free reign no guilt. I quit before my chosen date. Dunno why but I'm so glad. Chewing tobacco....Commit yourself to a workout program. Start a workout and within 5 minutes you will feel like you're dying. Use that as motivation to quit and get in shape. Do it for the ladies "When it came to quitting for my mom and I we were able to quit cold turkey but when it came to my dad quitting; pills, patches, and other stuff didn't work.  But what really worked was when over time he just cut back steadily.  Ya know going from 1 pack to 3/4s and lower over time.  He hasn't smoked since 2001.  ""Started smoking when I was 13 and by 21 I was a regular 1-1.5 packs a day smoker.

One day it was raining out and neither my roomate or I wanted to run to the store and get smokes. That was that. We ended up just chilling in the house for 2 days while the weather was crappy and after that I didn't bother smoking anymore. 


""First 3 months- no cigs at work. Meaning you can smoke on the way to and from work, all night, and all morning. Just not at work
Then for the next 6 months only smoke when drinking and eventually you'll just stop all together. 
Worked for me after smoking for 6 years. Haven't had one 16 months ""I had moved to a small town. Here it takes a good drive to go get cigarettes. I started to think the drive and gas weren't worth it. I effectively have been off since my last pack ran out on New Year's Eve 2012. I didn't plan it, I just realize I should stop since I ran out. Haven't smoked since.  

Cold turkey is the least effective method, but it helped me. Also the motivation to save money. ""jusy quit. just dont allow yourself to have another cigarette. i didnt go cold turkey, i let myself have 2 cigarettes a day instead of one big pack a day. did that for a week and then i just quit. its hard but in the end of the day all it takes is to just stop doing it. i dont think that any miracle cures could help you do that, just be disciplined enough to do what you have or want to do""I started smoking at the age of 17 when a couple months into dating a girl, who smoked, refused to quit. I told her ""if you don't quit then I'm gonna start"" thinking that would shock her out of it. Well needless to say, her being very self centered and me being at my hormonal prime of 17 yrs wanting a steady diet of sex and BJ's, I started smoking.

I smoked until I was 26, long after this high school relationship ended. The ironic thing is that what made me quit was meeting the girl of my dreams. She was never persistent, only concerned about my health and didn't like the lingering, smoky ash tray mouth. I quit cold turkey and haven't gone back since. The only help was eating the individual life saver mints like they were going out of style.

Good luck to anyone quitting. It's well worth it. I feel better than ever""I am someone who doesn't enjoy doing things how other people tell me to, or because others say I should. Because I knew that, I knew that I couldn't quit for any reasons but my very own. Not because it was bad for me, not because it was expensive, not because everyone around me wanted me to. I had to *want* to. I had tried quitting cold turkey 3 times before, for up to 3 months, and it obviously wasn't clicking.

So I started weaning off, cutting one cig back a day.. a very gradual process. After a month and a half, I was coming up on the end of my second pack and had gotten down to one or two cigs every few days. When the pack ran out, I rather nonchalantly decided 'Hey, I wonder how long I can last before I buy another pack?'
That was 5 months ago, and I feel pretty damn good. The cravings are still there every once in a while, especially when I've been drinking, but it is and will be getting easier. "I saw the + sign on the stick. Smoked my last one and used baby carrots and jolly ranchers as my new oral fixation.I realized I was killing myself and quit cold turkey."I smoked for around 4-5 years in my younger years and one day I woke up and decided it was time to quit before it became a serious health hazard, I was wheezing, out of breath, and just not feeling as healthy as I could be at that age. I decided to quit ""cold turkey"" (meaning no more no weening myself off,no cigs here or there) I removed myself from all smoking environments, people who smoked I stayed away or in another room away from the smoking. Eventually I stopped geting cravings, I stopped ""needing"" to smoke, My best advice is to remove yourself from all things that remind you of smoking as well as smoking itself. ""Probably not the best idea but I would go out and smoke as many cigarettes as you can one night and try to make yourself sick.  After that you won't want to smoke anymore.

What triggered me to quit was I was partying one night and smoked like 2 packs in one night, just chain smoking.  The next morning I woke up feeling horrible and tried to smoke a cigarette and gagged and nearly threw up on myself.  Havent had a puff since, i just think of that feeling everytime I have an urge.""I went through some freak crisis/Health scare where my fingers went all tingly and I thought for sure I was having oxygen deprivation or something from smoking. I quit and never went back. 
It really had something to do with pre-carpal tunnel but I never started back up! "I quit cold turkey so I can be more appealing to the opposite sex. "I fell off the side of a building and landed directly on my head. When I Woke up my leg was broken and I was border line retarded so sneaking out of the hospital to catch a smoke was out of the question. I had been wanting to quit anyway, and it seemed like a good time so I just did.""I quit the day she was born. I had tried many times and failed completely. I had switched to dip pouches about 3 months prior trying to convince myself it was an easier way. It was not and just another excuse for my brain to use to keep its nicotine fix.

My daughter was born and I went for a walk and a cry. How the fuck was I going to raise someone to do right if I could not? How could I expect someone to do what I told them if I could not do what I told myself. How could I protect her if I was dead.

I bought a pack of gum that night and that was it. I chewed so much gum over the next 5 months I was like a tunnel. Air in the mouth and right out the ass, that sucked even as a guy who like ripping wind.

The cravings stopped being constant after the first 48 hours. Then they were every 15 minutes. At the fourth month I was a mean SOB and I am thankful my lady stood by me and took it in stride. I did try a cigar once a month after the 8 month clean mark, I stopped that though as it would only lead me back to smoking full time.

Just quit, do you really want something to have that much power over you? Find a reason if it is not that simple for you like I did. Good luck! I hope you do it, it's amazing on the other side.

March will make 4yrs smoke free!""I all of a sudden realized that no matter when I decided to do it, it wasn't going to be any easier than that moment.  In fact, it would be easier now to stop because it is one fewer day of addiction and habit.  And I stopped.""I was a pack a day smoker working as a cook and smoked about every 20 minutes. I had tried quitting once before and did for about 3 months, then got drunk on st. pattys day began smoking again.

How I quit was completely on accident...
New years eve four years ago, I brought a handle of captain morgan to a house party, and the attic was the dedicated smoking area. We got there about 7pm and I don't remember anything after about 10. I stayed upstairs the whole night and smoked like a crazy person. I came in there with three packs of Parlement Full Flavors, and woke up the next morning, at a different house, with 3 smokes left. I had never felt more terrible then I did that day. I stepped outside and lit up a smoke and had one drag and felt like death, I never smoked again.

SO, get blackout drunk and smoke three packs of smokes in one evening, you'll never smoke again.""Not quitting is an active decision.  Every time you light a cigarette, you are making a conscious choice to not quit smoking.  When you decide to quit, you will quit.  It will feel hard, but you will be able to do it.""Start excercising and contiue to stay busy to keep my mind off smoking. I started running the day I quit smoking and continue to run a few times each week. My motivation: health, living, and running is a lot harder with smokers lungs! This worked incredibly for me; I have been smoke free for over 4 years!""I asked myself before every cigarette ""Do I really want this right now?""

I got down to smoking only 2 or 3 a day, then less than 1 a day, then maybe a few on the weekends only, and now almost never."Laser acupuncture.  That was 5 years ago in August!"Cold turkey never worked for me, even after getting my wisdom teeth out, I was smoking again a month later. Chantix scares the crap out of me because I have past history of depression and the reaction I've seen people have from the patches was unappealing. So I got an e-cig and I haven't had a cigarette in nearly a year and a half now, it was the easiest way I've found to quit.""TRIED:
* self-directed (many times)
* hypnosis (twice)
* Smoke Enders

SUCCESS:
* One Saturday morning in 1988 visited ""The Mad Russian"" Josef Shubenstov (sp?) in Brookline, Massachusetts. Near Fenway Park. This was a 3-hour group session with 30 other people.  The Russian spoke in a thick accent, described what he does - and that anyone can do it - and then goes on to ""treat"" each of us individually.  He remembers everyone's name.

Then we rise, walk out a door other than the main entry, pay the receptionist $35, and then drive home.  The first moment I realized something different went on was when I arrived home at 1PM after about an hour drive from Brookline and 4 and half hours since my last cigarette, it occurred to me that I had not smoked since my 8:30 appointment.

Smokers will know that after a 3 hour meeting the first think on one's mind is to have a smoke.  Normally.  The Russian claims to break the hard-wired connections in our brain's synapses which were learned through the addictive habit.  The Russian simply had each patient close their eyes and think about smoking; The Russian then, I believe (because my eyes were closed) waved his hand over my head, breaking the hard wired paths of cigarette addiction along with behavioral habits which make quitting so hard.

26-years later, no desire to smoke.  Maybe a couple of times a year I have a fleeting urge to sip a coffee and have a smoke, but it is gone in a moment.  Odd but I still like the smell of fresh, not stale, tobacco smoke; I just have no desire to partake.

The Russian was featured on one of the hour long TV news programs and reportedly was studied by nearby MIT and Harvard researchers and was found to be just a regular guyÛ? so, maybe anyone of us can do this for a career.

My experience was a lot like just pushing a ""quit"" button.""I haven't smoked in 15 years.  I use to drive a 1998 Mustang and never smoked in it.  I had enough willpower to not smoke in the car.  If I could do it during those times I drove then I could do stop smoking anytime I wanted to.  I came to realize I was treating my car better than my own body.  I quit cold turkey and only had headaches for a few weeks till I started to feel better.  My brother just quit smoking.  He kept telling himself ""oxygen tank"" when he wanted one cause he didn't want to end up needing one.  ""I didn't intend to quit, it kinda just happened.

I got one of those ecigs, nice ones that taste good. I don't like to smoke when I go home to visit my parents so I used the ecig exclusively when I went home for a week. When I went back the real cigs tasted so bad I just used the ecig from then on. A month later I wasn't even using that. ""As many in this thread have mentioned, one way or another, you have to *want* to quit. 

Personally I was slowly getting fed up with the fact that I couldn't run (or even walk sometimes) up a flight of stairs without getting winded.  I couldn't enjoy conversation after a meal because all I wanted to do was go outside and light up.  Even after 60 minutes of a movie I started enjoying it less since I was just wondering when it would be over and if I would miss anything if I snuck out for ten minutes.  

Whenever I got sick I felt even worse and had more of a disgusting taste in my mouth than when I didn't smoke.  I was spending all of my extra money on them.  My car was dirtier with ash and building up burn marks.  

Having my life manipulated like that for something that was not benefiting me in any way ultimately led to me deciding I didn't want to do it anymore.""I smoked for 10 years roughly a pack a day for the last few of those years
  I decided I needed to quit when I was between jobs for a couple months and realized I would be much better off without that 300 dollar a month burdon.  I had wanted to quit for a long time before that, as it actually hurt to smoke.  What I did was use the patch and the nicorette inhaler. I only used the inhaler for emergencies for the first 3 weeks.  You know when you reaally just need a drag? The inhaler will help with that.  I also used it when I was drinking.  But after the 3 weeks with the inhaler I gave it up too.  The trick is to not cheat. Not even once while youre drinking.  It has been 3 1/2 years and I dont even crave cigarettes anymore. Best decision of my life."My right lung spontaneously collapsed."I found that Chantix worked well for me.
the first time, I didn't take it really as long as I should have, I quit for a year. I was on pool leagues etc. necessitating that I spend a couple nights a week in a bar. that did me in.

I used chantix a second time about a year and a half ago, it worked again, still smoke free, with no will to go back. I am not in the bars much anymore which gets rid of that major trigger. but I guess they are smoke free now anyway.

I also only got a break when I was a smoker, but for the most part, I was the only smoker here. I am rarely around any smokers anymore which helps a lot.

""here is what i did, first i stopped buying them, then i used this amazing thing called willpower and didnt smoke it was awesome. I have a two page book coming out "I started taking a medication that said you cannot smoke on it. So I didn't.  Will power. "Ecig is working for me. I still have a pack of cigs laying around but most of the time I prefer the ecig, especially on these cold days.

The biggest thing is that you can use them anywhere and you lose that ""time to go for a smoke"" habit that usually breaks me.  It takes away a lot of the triggers.
Many times I find myself not using either the ecig or a cig for 5 or 6 hours.   ""I quit cold turkey, for good this time, about 14 years ago. My wife had found the cigarettes I had been hiding, we had a talk, I told her it was hard to quit and she was going to have to give me time. I got to thinking about it, and it dawned on me, ""Whose side am I on? Why am I defending this?"" I was tired of being a victim to the whole thing. I was tired of buying The Man's cigarettes. I was tired of feeling bad about myself. It was like a bad relationship I one day declared was over. I never looked back, never had the first craving, but most importantly never had that first cigarette thinking I could stop at one.""Running, getting fit. Cold turkey."I got pregnant.I actually quit lighting my cigarettes .. Instead of smoking. You can only get someone to light your cigs so many times."smoked a pack a day for 7-8 years. tried cold turkey dozens of times. Read ""the easy way to stop smoking"" by allen carr. Ive been without ONE cigarette for 5 years STRAIGHT!!""Toothpicks, quit cold turkey, and you really have to want to quit.  It took me 3 tries but now I'm up to a year and a half no cigs, and it feels great"2 packs a day for 2 years. 2 things; hott girlfriend who was made sick by the smoke. Sex > nicotine.  The way I quit was just not doing it anymore. "I started smoking when I was 17 and quit when I was 24; I smoked about a pack and a half a day at the end.  I caught a really bad flu that year and had to stop smoking since it would just make me feel worse while I was sick.  After I got better, I just thought it would be a cool experiment to see how much longer I could go without smoking.

Started running and lifting at the gym and haven't smoked now in two years.  Lost about 60 pounds in the process and I don't have crazy sleep apnea/loud snores now.  The weirdest part is that now whenever I smell cigarette smoke it makes me gag.""For me, I went cold-turkey. I had tried to ""cut back"" in the past, but I would always go from 2-cigs a day to 5-cigs a day, and back up and down. The first three days were complete hell. After that, it was only very, extremely frustrating. I haven't had a cigarette in a long time now, and though I do still sometimes crave the ""effect"", I find the smell of cigarettes to be gross."[Sick Boy Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2B7w4Z3uOI) always works.As dumb as this sounds I waited until I was sick. I had a cough/sore throat for a couple days and obviously didn't smoke during this time. I then just did it cold turkey - It was easier doing it this time because I had already gone a few days without smoking. After that it's all in your head."First, some background.

I started when I was 15. It was the cool thing, most stores didn't card, and even if they did, I knew enough people that I could just go in when friends were working and buy without getting hassled.

I smoked steadily for 15 years. I went from a few cigs a day to almost 2 packs a day in that time, made worse by the fact that I was working in a place that allowed smoking on the job. I almost couldn't function without a lit cigarette in my mouth or hand.

Well, due to insurance reasons, the place I was working finally banned smoking inside, and since I had finally had enough of sounding like a broken train engine whenever I exerted myself, I quit.

Cold fucking turkey.

I was a fucking cunt. I've never argued the point that I can be an asshole on the best days ÛÒ I'm blunt & honest to a ridiculous fault, which tends to piss people off and cause hurt feelings in the first place, but I was 100x worse without the smokes. I had no outlet, nothing to calm my nerves, no reason to walk out of a room. People would say stupid shit, and not only would I call them on it, I'd tear down any argument they made and make them look like fucking children.

I didn't care. If I was going to suffer, so was everyone else.

It got better, though. After about a month, I started to notice that I didn't feel nearly so edgy anymore. The craving quieted down, and eventually went away.

I had done it, I had quit!

Five years later, my wife's grandmother died. Dealing with the histrionic hypocrisy of my in-laws (half of whom didn't give a flying shit about Gram when she was alive) pushed me to the point of either beating the shit out of people or finding some chemical way of calming the fuck down, and since smoking is still more acceptable than being falling down drunk all the time, I bought a pack, and smoked for another 2 years.

This last time I got a prescription from my doctor for Wellbutrin. It had helped a couple of my friend quit smoking, so I figured I'd give it a try.

I can say that it was the easiest quit ever. Not only did it help my taper off the smokes, but I just gradually started forgetting to take the pills, and one day realized I had been without both cigarettes and meds for over 3 months.

As of right now, I have been smoke-free for 1 year, 5 months, and 3 days. I have an app on my iPhone called iQuit. Whenever I feel the urge, and it does happen, I just open it up and look at the amount of time I've been without smoking. It's small, but it's enough.""Electronic Cigarettes can be a great bridge to quitting if going cold turkey isn't an option.

I honestly believe cold turkey is still the best method, but e-cigs are a great alternative.

Just make sure you do your research before diving into the world of vaping, a lot of the information on them is still a bit cloudy, but with the right setup and information, it can be great!""The way I went at it is looking back at how I had slowly developed smoking more and more, and decided to reverse it to smoking less and less.
I broke it down to three a day, two a day one a day etc for a couple weeks.
I work in an environment where taking a smoke break is the only way to get a break.
Just like any other drug addiction, you'll have to get yourself away from situations where you know you'll end up going back to the habit as well as getting a great support behind you. That's one of the best things I have to thank my girlfriend for.
And always remember that as stressed out as you might be, smoking bring 100% ZERO benefits to you to you""Cold turkey. And some NLP techniques courtesy of Allen Carr's How to stop smoking book.

Not far off two years now and can't believe I ever smoked.

[Link to book here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1wjy5y/exsmokers_of_reddit_what_actually_worked_to_get/cf2nt0l)""I am with andrewse. I went cold turkey. There were hard times waking up dazed and confused an not knowing if you smoked yesterday or it was a very vivid dream. Going a while and being happy with yourself that you haven't thought about a cigarette or smoking in a month and then bam you remember what absolute beauty it was taking a drag. After 7 years of cold turkey I can say that  I have absolutely no desire to smoke even when someone else is doing it in front of me.

TL;DR COLD TURKEY""What actually worked...

Wanting to quit.

I really mean this, saying you want to quit and actually wanting to quit make the biggest difference.

I sat down and calculated how much money I was wasting and how shitty I was feeling...

BUT, in the end...

I mentally did not want to do it anymore. 13 years of smoking and I just said fuck it and quit cold turkey. 

I was an asshole for 2 weeks and a grump for about a month longer after that.

Then it was smooth sailing.

I just wanted to quit and I was stubborn enough to follow through with it.""One day I just got mad at cigarettes, tossed an almost new pack in the trash, and never smoked again. I think tossing out the whole pack like that instead of smoking them all first had a big psychological impact for me, it reinforced that quitting was my true will, and anything else was addiction trying to win."Champix worked I was able to quit over the summer by almost dying from an asthma attack. It was not a good idea to start smoking as an asthmatic to begin with. "I got the flu and could not inhale a cigarette without almost choking to death, so I went without one for about a week and a half.  I figured that was a while so why not just quit.....  It worked!  So my advice... go catch the flu?"Girl I fell in love with told me she would never seriously date a smoker. This was a Saturday evening. I quit that following Monday. "I quit by accident i supoose. I had tried to quit several times before and just couldn't do it. I tried the patch and that was pretty helpful but I could never stop completely. 

I couldn't even quit when i was pregnant. I know it was horrible, i would smoke 1-2 a day. I usually smoked about 1/2 pack a day sometime more on weekends.

In my mid 20's I lost a bunch of weight quickly and as a result my gallbladder planned a revolt! I ended up in the hospital, unable to eat anything at all and was told i had to have it out. I was in a lot of pain, like worse than childbirth. The thought of going out for a cigarette didn't even cross my mind.

I had the surgery and was in hospital for a week on crazy pain meds. When i got out, i hadn't smoked in close to 2 weeks and thought ""hell, lets see how long i can go without""

that was...6 years ago?, and i haven't smoked another cigarette. It was so wierd after because i hadn't planned to quit. I always used to smoke while driving - what would i do to fill the habit? Camping? what is there to do but sit around the fire smoking and roasting weenies.

I had to sell my car because i couldn't stand the smell - aw poor me right? The new car was so nice i didn't want anyone to smoke in it anyway. Camping? i would go hiking, swimming, fishing whatever.

I have no regrets at all and actually I now find, now that i'm in my 30's, my friends who still smoke are starting to age much faster than i am. I have better skin now than i did when i was 20.

if you can quit. DO IT! it's amazingly rewarding for years after. and now that Vaping is a huge thing, in fact my husband works for a Vape company, that is such a great option, it's now easier than ever before.""What kind of e-cigs do you have? I was able to put down real cigs replaced by the e-cigs. Although I started using the disposable ones such as Blu and many different gas station ones, I ultimately went to the higher end models.

I use an MVP iTaste with an iClear 30s tank. It was expensive at first ($100 to get the kit) but once I got it all, the experience was completely different. It really made a difference for me.

My body actually went through the ""healing process"" as if I quit smoking. I (theoretically) am no longer getting any carcinogens like tar or other stuff, and its mainly pure nicotine that I get now. As a side note, I do not use mass produced liquids, I buy the stuff that is hand made by the vapor shop and has the ingredients listed.

This obviously is not the best, as e-cigs are not completely tested as far as long term affects. But for me, it has been great, I can smell things I wasnt able to smell before. I no longer get out of breath doing simple things, I no longer have the ""smokers cough"" when laughing hard or waking up. Its great. 

I have been smoking e-cigs for almost a year now, I have not a real cigarette since May of 2013. So if you are having trouble switching to the gas station style e-cigs, try going with a nice high end one, it worked for me.""I tried nicotine spray ( horrible, gave me a headache ), patches and gum. None of them worked, for me at least, so I just told myself not to bother, the price for 20 a day was killing me slowing, so I quit. 2 years now, sheer willpower and lack of money helped.""I quit cold turkey, but I always would want to bump a cigarette off someone...each time I thought about smoking, I would convince myself that if I smoked that cigarette..I'll get cancer immediately...I knew that was kinda silly...but it started fucking with my head."I drank a glass of water every time I wanted a cigarette. By the 5th glass of water I didn't want anymore water thus off shooting my wanting of cigarettes. Weird but worked. The threat of having to eat a family smoking fee myself which would be an extra thousand dollars per year.The best way to stop is wanting to stop and then doing it."This is probably not a very healthy way to get rid of it, nor safe, but my wife (who was a smoker since she was 15...now 32) got pneumonia 6 years or so ago, and after spending a week in the hospital, she hasn't touched a cigarette since.

Interestingly enough, she hasn't experienced asthma since either (she used to have allergy and activity induced asthma, but hasn't had either since."Chantix did the trick for me. I didnt have any of those crazy dreams people talk about. After the third week on that shit I didnt even crave a smoke. "It really never goes away.  But I made a decision to quit smoking and never picked one up again. Its worked for about 5 months now. Ever so often I'll bum one of the kind I like and have a smoke. But that's it. It tastes discussing and smell bad now, and that keeps me from continuing."Chantix"I just had to quit for myself. I stopped while I was pregnant, for obvious reasons, but couldn't wait until I was done so I could smoke again.. Finally I decided I wanted to quit for **me** and not for the baby or my husband.. I was a hard few weeks but I have not smoked since **August 2009**. Every now and again I get a craving but I just fight it off or smell someone smoking, it really is a smelly nasty habit. ""What actually worked is quitting again after falling off the wagon, but really trying every time to stay off nicotine for as long as I could. At some point, got nicotine patches and never went back to smoking. Been over 3 years smoke-free. ""I went cold turkey, but only because I lost my job and ran out of money.  I figured eating was more important.  Working again, but haven't picked up a stick since then.""I know a ton of people swear by ""Easy Way"" and while I contribute my success to the book, its more than that. The book itself really just got through to the rational part of my brain.
 
After reading it, I actually just really wanted to quit. Wanting to quit is only thing that's going to help you quit. Everyone is different. My advice to you, OP, is to recognize your triggers for what they are. Its your brain trying to get you to smoke, nothing more than that. That cigarette isn't going to lower your stress. And the really bad craving only last a week or so. Good luck :)""I was opening my first cadaver,..... in school. As soon as we removed the thoracic cage horror ensued. This man had one very small charcoal lookin' lung and the other was in unrecognizable gelatin pieces, stuck to the rib cage. Come to find out the man died from an excruciating lengthy suffocation, while coughing up his own lung. All of this was the side effect of years of smoking. 

I quit that day and never looked back. ""I went with e-cigs, not the big fancy vapouriser things but the ones that look like cigarettes. I've been smoke free for a year now and I found recently after a bad chest infection that I've been using it less.""I like nicotine. Always have, probably always will. So for me, real snus, Swedish snus was the ticket. I still get what I want without the detrimental effects of lighting a plant on fire and inhaling. If you go this route, avoid the Camel/Marlboro/Skoal varieties. General, Thunder, Skruf, Ettan, etc are examples of some of the Swedish made brands that are worth a try. ""I tried quitting a lot of different ways in the 20+ years I smoked. I finally tapered off and was smoking only here and there and days would go by... The clinker finally was my vanity. I didn't want one of those butthole mouths. So, I just kept 'putting off' smoking until it smelled and tasted disgusting. The urge just floated away when I tasted how gross it really was. But it took a long time to get there..."I quit about 20 times a day. Cold turkey.  Damned lighter couldn't keep the drumstick lit.ecigsVapor."Try herbal cigarettes. No nicotine, but satisfies the need for smoke in the lungs. The lack of nicotine will help you lose your addiction. When you're really wanting to smoke, 1 herbal cig tastes and feels great. The second one, or if you don't have the need, will taste rather nasty though. ""in mother Russia, smoking quits you cold turkey.""I used the patch, my thinking being that I knew I wanted to quit, and the only reason I wasn't quitting was because I was physically addicted. I decided to break the battle up into giving up smoking at first, the psychological habit forming stuff like one after every meal, and having to hold something between your fingers. The constant stream of nicotine made me think of smoking a cigarette at the same time as a bit silly. Once I weened myself down to the equivalent of a cigarette worth of nicotine a day on the patch quitting was pretty easy.


The folks over at /r/stopsmoking were also a big help in the process."Yeah I just chewed a toothpick every time I craved one. "My last cigarette was at midnight new years eve 1994, cold turkey was the method but there were some extenuating circumstances. I wanted to quit; really wanted it. 

I started smoking at 16 because it was the cool thing to do. 25 years later when I quit it was no longer cool. You couldn't smoke at work or in any public places any longer and very few of my circle of friends still smoked so they wouldn't come to my house. I loved to throw parties and with nobody wanting to be in my house quitting was the only answer. 

Last month it has been 19 years since I smoked a cigarette and I'm grateful that being cool was so important to me even if it sounds like a silly reason.  Also the amount of money I haven't spent is mind boggling if you really think about it.   

""I made an account just to reply to this. Hi!

I never lit up much as a teen, but when I was 22 I got a job working outside all-day and between the periods of high activity we had periods of boredom. Two of my coworkers smoked, and our job didn't have rules against us smoking during work, and these two coworkers so happened to be the one's I was around the most.

I didn't really *want* to start smoking, but I figured 'why not?' After several offers to try a cig, I gave it a go and thought it wasn't harmful to try. I also was humoured by the fact that it didn't seem addicting at all - the first few times I smoked purely out of choice and only once or twice a week.

Fast forward a month, I became used to smoking during our periods of boredom and soon found myself buying a few packs a week, but only smoking while at work.

I started developing headaches that would come almost every day, and would at times become nauseating and intense. I also started to realise how much it would labour me to run or jog around our facility.

After a few years of this the headaches became daily and the pain would persist despite taking medications, I lost my job through no fault of my own and didn't have money to purchase and sustain my habit anymore. Through the withdrawls I noticed my headaches became less and less frequent.

After over two years, I'm much healthier and it looks silly to me seeing people smoke.

TL;DR Lack of money and health issues made me quit. And now it seems silly to me that people smoke cigs.

I smoked from 22-27, wish I never had. I'm a full supporter of raising tobacco taxes and prices to make people stop for lack of money.

Thanks for reading this! =]""I had always noticed my smoker's cough and the occasional shortness of breath, but never really paid it much attention. One day after a run I hacked up the single most revolting excretion my body has ever produced. Stubbornly adhered to the basin of my bathroom sink was a hunk of phlegm the size of a marble, encased in a slimy, placental membrane and clearly delineated into a tricolor banding of red-brown, milky white, and Nickelodeon green. Now when I get the urge to smoke I look at my empty palm and imagine holding a marble. Works like a charm.""You have to recommit every day to it. Once you quit, never smoke another cigarette again. 
Ride out the craving; they pass within five minutes. Take each small victory and stack them up. 
Take deep breaths when cravings hit. Since you don't smoke anymore you never do that breathing pattern, it's better for you to take a drag without a cigarette! And it helps the craving pass. 
Make yourself do push-ups or walk a block or freewrite or anything you decide when you have bad cravings. 
Get out there for a ""smoke break"" when you're feeling strong and don't smoke so you know you can do it. Take away your excuses and make them evidence of your strength. 
Recommit every day. You're a non-smoker now. 
Never smoke a cigarette again, that's the only real trick. I know it sounds condescending, but it's how you have to get your head to think. Do whatever you have to do  to prove to yourself you can do it. 
Because you can do it! "And don't take a slip up as a complete failure! This is very important! So you went a week without and then had a cigarette on a particularly stressful day. You screwed up. That doesn't mean you're a smoker again! It's part of getting there. Don't let yourself take that as a failure and excuse to dive back in as a full blown smoker! It's not a failure! You're still quitting. Recommit! You'll get there. Just don't be so easy on yourself that you allow it to keep happening! "Chantix.  It was so easy that I felt like I was cheating.  I never could've done it without it and the dreams were awesome!  I know some people have issues so be careful, but when it works, it really works.""I looked at something expensive that I really wanted, and weighed that with the stupidity and cost of smoking and that did it for me.  I had been smoking for 11 years, and for some reason that worked. I have not touched one since 2004. Good luck to you.""Motivation. 

I quit smoking cold turkey one day to the other because I'm a competitive person - I dared myself to see how long I could go. It's been 2 months with no cravings now, every week is another milestone. People are impressed - I still hang out with smokers all day, they asked me teasingly in the beginning, now they're saying ""No man, he quit, don't tempt him!"" when someone else asks me if I want a smoke.

The difference between me and my friends (who also tried quitting) is that I wanted to, they were all asked to stop by their parents/partners. There's no *real* motivation, because they don't want to stop, they just don't want their parents/whoever to find out that they still do it."ecig!"Fear. At 28 I had a panic attack that made me worried the smoking was causing heart problems. That got me through the first few days. 

After that, it was just determination. ""I was not a hardcore smoker (never bought my own packs, but would have rollies every now and then).  Whenever I was with people who smoked, I would bum one or two for the night.  

It all ended when I started dating someone who did not smoke.  Period.  I never wanted her to smell it on me, for me to have bad breath, or any of that crap.  To curb urges, I would do pushups.  Everyone benefits.  I gained weight, but in muscle mass.

Like the top comment said, if it is important, you'll get it done.""Ecigs were the only thing that worked for me.  haven't touched a cigarette in 2 years.  I still vape, but it's at the lowest dosage I can order.  Sometimes I even dilute that. ""I quit a few weeks ago, just a  completely random thing. It was all willpower ""I've quit after reading ""The easy way to stop smoking"" by Allen Carr the first time. I'm not saying the book helped a lot, but it didn't hurt, as it kept hammering down how much smoking sucks. 

I've also quit using the patch AND the nicotine gum SIMULTANEOUSLY. It was significantly easier than expected.

Both times, I had no doubt in my mind that I wanted to quit. ""I had gotten so sick I had to go to the hospital. I was only smoking for 7-8 years. They never found a think wrong but my lungs were weak. 

I quit cold turkey the night I was admitted never touched the stuff since."I got sick and smoking just made it worse. So I stopped. I think the key for me was I convinced myself cigarettes were making me sick to my stomach. boom no mo cancer stix. Smoker for 5 yrs I tried and failed a number of times. I complimented cold turkey by buying the whole nicorette deal. I told myself that if I broke I would go to the nicorrette. Helped me alot because I didnt really want the nicorette. Maybe it would help you to. I went from near a pack a day to free. Hope you succeed! "I've been quit for just over 4 years now.  I always hated how I had to pat myself down every time I left the house to make sure I had my cigs and lighter.  What a panic I would fly into if I was out and found I had no cigarettes with me!  Pathetic.  I tried quite a few times to quit... most of them cold turkey.  The last two times I tried, I enlisted the help of Champix (chantix, whatever the psychotic little pill is called).  I found that it made me so nauseous, that my life was miserable.  I finally just got fed up and said ""To Hell with it!"", threw the champix in the bin right next to the cigs and my lighter.  Now, that's not to say that it was easy, far from it.  The cravings are almost debilitating at first.  And even after a few months, they can catch you unawares.  The most important thing, I think, is developing new routines in order to either avoid, or cope with, your triggers (first you have to id them).  You gotta get angry, you gotta get mean!  If you can dodge a wrench, you can quit smoking. I won't wish you good luck, you don't need it and it wouldn't help anyway. YOU CAN DO IT.

When you feel a craving, concentrate on your breathing, pick your nose, tie your shoes, do SOMETHING for about 2 mins.... craving gone!""Just quit totally cold turkey. I smoked for like 12 years heavily and I just quit for the first time successfully about two months ago and haven't batted an eye at it. I have no desire to smoke again. Getting here, however, required that I basically take a week off - **_an entire week_** - and eat nothing but candy/anything I could find and cry. The withdrawals were *brutal* but a week or so under my belt and I was golden. Just keep at it. Don't give up. There's absolutely no easy way to do it, so just do it."My trigger was work too. Someone would say or do sth incredibly stupid or infuriating and then I would go outside to smoke to literally be away from the situation. Find a new job and get away from your trigger."I hated smoking. I switched from Marlboro Reds to Marlboro Red 72's, and before long I was only smoking half a cigarette before I would put it out. One day, my girlfriend-at-the-time's father passed away (of old age, not smoking) and the day he died, I quit smoking. It's been almost 3 years since then, and I haven't smoked since.""**Here is how I did it**:

Different things work for different people but remember if your will is strong it can beat any habit or addiction.

It took me several attempts to quit. I am 29 now and its been probably over a year for me since I quit. The one key thing that got me through quitting was replacing the habit not the addiction. Not necessarily cold turkey, but this method works best I found. 

The chemical addiction wears off in days, but the comfort and habit that is formed is what gets you. I can tell you right now sometimes I feel the need to light up again, but the moments are fleeting and truthfully it is because I used to associate joyous and stressful situations with a cigarette. 

You need to replace the habit with something else. It is about conditioning and association - almost like tricking your mind.  If you need to use temporary alternatives (patches, gum and vaporizers) for the first little while do it, but after a few weeks you will notice so many positive changes and you really wont want to go back. The smell will disgust you and even make you gag sometimes. These are some things I noticed after the first few months of quitting:

-The ability to taste food better

-Being able to breath through your nose better

-Not running out of breath when going up stairs or having sex etc

-No more coughing

-You wont get sick as much

-cloudiness and agitation of the mind fades

-you stink less

-saving lots of money 

Just remember you can do it. Do not quit for your kids or your significant other, it wont work and can cause relationship problems. Quit only for yourself, promise only yourself and you will be in control of it. You will no longer have that feeling that you need to have smokes on you everywhere you go, just to be whole. If you have any questions or need someone to talk to, send me a PM.

It is a hard road my friend, but once you get there I can promise that you will feel free and proud. "I quit cold turkey right off after 3 attempts of saying I will then one day I just did it cause it started to make me sick.Peppermint oil. Like real peppermint oil. Altoids and such. Chewing actual peppermint leaves. The peppermint mimics nicotine just enough to subside cravings. Cigarette companies hate me.The girl I idolozed became single and she would never date a smoker. I quit smoking that night. I've had maybe a twenty cigarettes in the last 7 years since. Always with her (now my wife) permission and typically while drinking because that is my nirvana. Bottom line it's like working out or dieting. You have to have a reason for it and develop self restraint. "I wanted to quit, knew I needed to, bought the patches but didn't feel 100% committed and knew I would be unsuccessful unless I was 10 toes in. After about a year, I got the flu with the worst cough I've ever had. On the 3rd day, I told my girlfriend to throw out the half carton I had left and never smoked again. I think the flu lasted long enough for me to get past the worst part of the withdrawal. Can't exactly recommend this approach though."Chantix. That is the only reason I'm not still smoking."> about what the recourse was for stopping in 

Chantix really screwed with me. I did quit while I was on it but my family said I was a zombie the whole time. "I'd say the smoking cessation app helped me a ton & just reading about what the recourse was for stopping in general. You just have to be strong willed. Its tuff for the first two months but you can do it. Working out really helped too.My father quit after open heart surgery so there's thatSERIOUS: Quit 60-80 or so times until practice makes perfect. It becomes easier each time until you one day realize you have quit for the last time. I went cold turkey and went to the doctor when I was having anxiety from the withdrawals.  She gave me a month's prescription of Xanax and that was the end of it.  Never had a Xanax or cigarette again. "I smoked for 15 years,  and as dumb as it sounds,  I successfully quit when I honestly decided to just not smoke anymore.  It was hard as hell,  and I really wanted to smoke badly,  but I decided I wanted to quit more than I wanted to smoke.   Until you get to that point nothing will work,  you are stronger than you think,  will power is an amazing force.   Good luck,  and it does get easier! 
"I didn't tell anybody that I quit. They had to figure out themselves.I stopped buying them. Chantix. That stuff was magic. The first three days were still enough hell that I have never smoked anything with tobacco in it since though."I'm not a smoker, but part of my studies included habit training; this is what I remember off the top of my head.

As with lots of habits, it helps to identify what your triggers are--such as ""being at work"" as you described. In addition to physical contexts, think about social (with certain people), temporal (certain time of day), emotional (e.g. feeling stressed) situations that might lead up to lighting up. 

 Can you talk to a manager or HR to discuss your desire to take a break without having to smoke? Doesn't seem very fair that only smokers can take a break while non-smokers do not. 

Also, find some social support. Try to find someone to be your ""non-smoking buddy"" who is willing to encourage you when you're feeling tempted. It'll help make you feel more accountable compared to if you were just doing it on your own--I imagine it's kinda like having a gym buddy who you would disappoint if you didn't go to the gym with them.

You're showing great persistence, so don't be discouraged by a relapse. A relapse is not a failure; it's an opportunity to reflect what you could do differently next time to avoid it in the future. Changing habits take tons of time and effort, so the fact that you're continuing to try shows that you have a real desire and motivation to quit--and that's good. 

(sidenote: on average people attempt to quit smoking about 7 times before quitting for good.)""stop buying cigarettes. smoked for 18 years. haven't smoked now for last 3 years and counting.

i imagine this method will work for most drug/food addictions."Start flossingJust stop.  I decided it was time and I soaked the pack in the sink and threw it in the trash.  I told myself that my will was stronger than any addiction and I would exercise control over my own life."I finally did it about 2 months ago, and it actually helped when I got sick. I got strep troat and when I was at about the worst part of the sickness I had a smoke for the last time. I remembered that feeling of coughing and hurting every time I wanted a smoke afterwards. After awhile I connected sore throat with smoking and didn't want one again. ""E-cigs, not those Blu pieces of shit, but actual buildable vaporizers. They actually worked for me and I even got a few of my friends to use them.""/u/kirkirus said basically everything that I would say. I would like to add that when I quit, I had the work-smoking association as well, so to break the cravings I put my keys on a lanyard and would spin them around my fingers whenever the cravings got bad.

We are creatures of habit, and while you can break a habit, it can be easier if you replace it with something else."I Quit halfway through the pack just tore the rest in half . Quitting on your own terms makes a huge difference. Self empowerment helps tremendously! "I quit cold turkey, but I took a cigarette and emptied out the tobacco and filled it with shredded paper. I walked around with that cigarette for a few days pretending to smoke it. The habit of smoking was what I was really addicted to. A fat joint when you're really stressing helps too.
""I created a plan that worked for me. I used certain nicotine products that they say not to use in conjunction with others. 


* **Stage 1** (2 Weeks) cigarette reduction

Pre-quit patches - I used these to cut down the amount of times I lit up a day. I didn't sleep with them

Tic-tacs - Instead of a cigarette I would sometimes have a tic-tac

* **Stage 2** (1 Week) no cigarettes

Patches - Amount in patch increased slightly from pre-quit stage. I didn't sleep with them

Inhaler - Used inhaler around 4-6 times a day instead of cigarette

Tic-tacs - Lots and lots of Tic-tacs

* **Stage 3** (2 Weeks) patch reduction, inhaler reduction

Patches - Decrease amount in patches the 2 weeks. I didn't sleep with them

Inhaler - Used inhaler around 2-4 times a day instead of cigarette

Tic-tacs - Tic-tacs are starting to make me sick so I cut back

* **Stage 4** (1 Weeks) no patch, inhaler reduction

Inhaler - Reduce inhaler use to 0 over 1 week

Tic-tacs - Tic-tacs are making me sick so I only have a few a day""I quit cold turkey when I got together with the girl of my dreams. We were friends for 5 years. She went away to school for 3 years and we kept in contact. While she was gone those 3 years I picked up smoking, alot of it. She had no idea I did. But mentioned she would never, ever be with someone who smoked. After she was done school she moved back to town and we went on out on our first date. Then and there I knew she was the one. And I quit, not willing to ever lose her. It's now been 4 years we have been together. I Have not picked one up in 4 years. Sorry for any improper English (second language). 
 ""I quit due to my health. Being 18 and you start smoking, let's be real it's cool as shit. So I started on cigars, moved to dip, then to unfiltered cigs. Smoked for about a year then my asthma started to getting the best of me. 

I was tired all the time, got sick like 10 times in 1 year (I usually get sick like once every 5 years) and you know, if I didn't have my morning cig before work, my whole day was ruined. 

I haven't quit all together, by that I mean I have 100% stopped cigs but I still smoke hookah. The only reason for doing that is I do love smoking, so hookah gives me a way to enjoy smoking and not feel shitty after. Like I can go days without hookah and feel totally normal, no shaky, head spinning, feel like you're gonna rip your eyes out feeling. Plus it doesn't mess with my asthma but hey, to each his own. I'm glad I quit the cigs. I've passed on being with a few girls since I stopped purely because the smell would almost make me physically vomit. 

One day I'll quit the hookah, maybe if I get married or have kids. But for now I'm stress free and cigs are a reminder of how fucking dumb I used to be. ""What worked for my dad was actually pretty sad.    He tried to quit a dozen times before, and always become monstrously angry and absolutely horrid to deal with.          
So when I was a young teenager (like 13 I think) he told me he was going to try to quit again.      
I got a sad look on my face, and told him ""...Could you not?  we all know you won't manage it, and you get so angry and mean when you try, then you go right back to smoking.  I hate it.""            
He got similar responses from the rest of the family.         
It broke his heart.          
He actually managed to quit for good that time.   I guess we finally gave him a reason to hate the things.""R/stopsmoking helped me immensely. That and Alan carr's book ""the easy way."" Really put things in perspective. In the end it's all the things everyone says, the patch, nicotine lozenges, gum, and a drive to finally do it. It takes a few weeks until you start to really feel like its a good decision and your mind stops doing loop dee loops to get you back on it.

The crazy part for me was realizing I had spent a bunch of money on making sure my apartment had a balcony. A balcony I never use now. Your priorities change, your values change when you're not addicted anymore. ""Cold turkey. Believe it or not. I tried everything to quit. Patches, gum and electronic cigarettes didn't help, and I found made the withdrawal longer and harder. Once you get over a week or two without smoking it gets way easier. Just tough it out, drink lots of water and don't tell everyone youve quit or are quitting. ""I got the flu. Got a week in without smoking, and I decided to see how long I could go. That was sept 2012. I have had 3 since, all while very drunk. I didn't beat myself up over them, just decided to acknowledge the slip up and move on. I miss it sometimes, but it's not that bad. I smoked a pack a day for 15 years up until then. "Watching my father die of lung cancer."As far as e-cigs go, don't stop at blu. There's an entire world of great products out there. If you pm me I can recommend a starter kit that's pretty cheap.

EDIT: and with the ecig - start out by smoking when you want to smoke, and vaping when you want to vape. I saw my cigarette use drop dramatically, and then I was able to cut it out altogether. ""I got a bad case of bi-lateral pneumonia and quit cold turkey.  Basically both of my lungs were pneumonia ridden, and earned me a nice stay in ICU for three days!  The positive of this?  I couldn't have smoked for two weeks if I wanted too!  
I remember my last drag before I went to the hospital, it felt like someone was ripping my lungs out.  
I had wanted to quit for awhile before this but didn't know how too and just didn't have the will power too.  

I made a pact with myself I would never smoke again after that ordeal and 4 years later I still haven't picked up a smoke.  It is truly one of the best things I've ever done.  ""What worked for me is that I realized that the chemicals in cigarettes had physically re-wired my brain to need them in more ways than to just be addicted, so I had to re-wire it.

Its a habit, an escape to your problems, a moment alone, blah blah.  Its so much more than an addiction.  What you need to do to quit is first you have to truly want it, you won't achieve something you don't want.  Next, you need to start filling in the gaps where you would be smoking with something else like eating a snack, reading a book, a quick meditation.  Anything to help you get away from the oral fixation of smoking because that's a big point of habit/addiction that people miss when they stop smoking.  One more thing that helps is strengthening your will power.  To do this you do really small things that you don't wanna do and start to move up to bigger things.  Those dishes in the sink?  Do that shit.  Messy car?  Clean that shit up.  The more you force yourself to do things you don't want to do the stronger your will becomes until not even nicotine can dominate you.

I also totally understand your trigger being at work.  I am an electrician and if there is no drywall up in a house everyone is smokin' up in that bitch every second of the work day and it becomes impossible to avoid.  That is where your true test of will power comes in and why you have to want to quit.  My girlfriend works as a chef and just like you, she can only get her 10 if she steps out for a smoke.  She just started watching out for when other people go out to smoke and goes outside with them and plays her didgeridoo while everyone else smokes.  

I wish you the best of luck on your next attempt.  Cigarettes are a terrible and filthy habit and you will feel amazing once you are finally free.  Just understand that your brain is now hard-wired to want to smoke and you must re-wire it.  The way to re-wire it is by creating new healthy habits and small exercises in will power everyday.  If anyone has any more to add to this then please do.""I got my dad to quit smoking when I was 18 by starting smoking. I smoked in front of him only, really. I hated it, it was disgusting. He quit smoking but I was hooked for a couple years. My girlfriend at the time said she would move in with me if I quit smoking so I quit smoking. Regular sex is a strong motivator.""I feel very relevant here! 

I used Chantix. 

And /r/stopsmoking was a useful subreddit too, but they're not as accepting of anyone who doesn't quit cold turkey. They highly recommend ""The Easy Way"" by Allen Car. I tried to read t by it was poorly written. Kind of like 50 Shades. ""I smoked for 15 years and had wanted to stop for a whole. I ended up with a pretty flu/cold for about a week and hadn't smoked at all. After a few days I decided to see how long I could go without smoking. I stumbled a couple times (2 drags), but it's been 2 and half years.""I've always said quitting is easy. I've done it 9 times. The trick is, once you've quit, recognizing that you have an addiction, which means that you can't have even one cigarette. What you need is an appropriate motivation and a substantial amount of will power.
 As for motivation, the last time I quit, I did it for my daughter's 2nd birthday (2 weeks before, actually, because I didn't want to ruin her party). That was my present to her, extra years with her dad and not watching me die a slow and painful death (at least not as a result of my smoking). Every time I have an urge I remind myself why I quit. If I started back it would be like taking back her present.
 Perhaps you don't have kids. That's okay. Quit for your future children. Quit for your parents or siblings or someone you love. Quit for yourself.
 Or, quit for humanity. Quit for the sake of human dignity. We humans like to pretend we are at the top of the food chain, that this is proof of our genetic superiority, but I submit to you that we are not, though we could be. Tobacco is our natural predator. A plant. Sure, any individual plant is reaped, dried, and ultimately burned for our 'pleasure,' but if you look at our relationship with tobacco from its perspective, you quickly see who is using whom. We grow fields of this plant. We tend to it carefully, making sure each individual grows healthy and strong before reaping. We even breed it to be hardier and more addictive (the source of its power over us!), thus ensuring its continued proliferation. And in the end we die slow horrible deaths as a result. Are you going to let a plant beat you at the genetic game?
 Consider also that quitting doesn't just improve your physical health. It is an exercise in will power. It is proof of the superiority of the conscious mind over the subconscious urge. Are you defined by your mind or your body? You can do this. You can quit.""It's likely been said over and over again, but I'll throw my story out for you anyway: 

I quit during August of last year. I had no real desire to quit, aside from the financial benefits. What changed? I enjoy playing D&D and similar games, so I posted on another subreddit and found a group local to me. One of the guys in the group had an electronic cigarette that, to the untrained eye, looked like a vapor-producing lightsaber handle. I got to talking with him and it turned out he had a spare battery, tank, and juice he was willing to let me borrow for a week to see if I liked it. I figured the worst that would happen is I give him back the gear and it's no loss to either of us. A week later when we met up to game again, I was hooked. Why would I want to stay on tobacco when I could taste delicious Sweet Tarts all day and still get my nicotine and no one bitches about the smell? I bought the gear off of him for just $10(which, looking back, was a REALLY cheap price) and a week after that I had put down tobacco cigarettes for good. Honestly, I didn't even try that hard. The most effort I made was deciding not to buy another pack once my last one ran out. Two days off of tobacco and just vaping, I tried a cigarette and it was just nasty. It couldn't even finish it. Since then, I've had zero inclination to go back to tobacco, and have upgraded my e-cig quite a bit. 

Shortly after dedicating myself to vaping and getting rid of tobacco, I found /r/electronic_cigarette. This has been a HUGE resource in finding the gear and e-liquid that was right for me, as well as educating myself on vaping in general. It's also full of nothing but support for newbies that want to get into vaping but have no idea where to start. If your current e-cig is a Blu or similar, drop by /r/electronic_cigarette and get set up properly. It makes worlds of difference. ""Honestly? I was sick of my familly/friends bitching about it. I started exercising again, eating healthy and started smoking cigars (no inhale) for a treat on weekends.

It's been a few years. Smoking cigarettes grosses me out now. I don't frown upon smokers, but hopefully they'll get fed up like I did and decide it's time to move on. Cheers!""Seriously this:

http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lMDfyF1VF6o

Smoked a pack a day for years until saw this. A couple failed attempts in there. Quit the next day for good.

Good luck!""TBH, Cold turkey and will power.  I was told (and believe this to be true) that nicotine only stays in your body for 7 days.  If you can make it past that it is all mental.

Of course I picked up the habit again 5 years later.""Smoked at least a pack a day, up to two packs sometimes, for over 20 years. E-cigarettes really helped where patches, gums, lozenges, cold turkey and Wellbutrin all failed. Gave myself license to hit them as often as needed, and after about 6 weeks, just tapered off in a way that never would have worked with actual cigarettes. Also had a real desire NOT to be a slave to the fucks at Philip Morris anymore. :). CIGARETTE FREE FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS!!"Determination. Set a date to quit. Quit on that date. No going back. Buy something good with the money you save.Chantix. Smoked 3 packs a day for over 40 years. Tried and failed to quit with everything else. Finally had doctor prescribe Chantix. Took it for about 4 1/2 months. That was 5 years ago. I still get an occasional craving especially when I see someone light up like maybe in a TV show. Stopping changed my life. Probably saved it too."I never officially quit; I just don't smoke today. Somehow the idea of quitting was too much to process, but I didn't want to have my three year old son see me smoking. So I didn't smoke one day, and then didn't smoke the next, or the day after that. That was a year and a half ago, and so far I haven't had a cigarette. For the first few weeks I had nicotine cravings, which I satisfied with Nicorette lozenges. Far better than the gum; they give you that *pow* of nicotine release that gum and other products don't.  Highly recommend:  http://www.nicorette.ca/products/lozenge""> I never officially quit; I just don't smoke today

Yep, that's how I am about it.  Kept picturing my infant with a cigarette in his mouth, so I decided not to smoke any more that day.  It's been almost 15 years now.  I figure when I'm 80, I'll take it back up.  So instead of quitting, it's just stopping for 45 years or so.

"Electric cigarettes.  Everytime you pick up a cigarette ask yourself this question. Is this cigarette worth losing a day of my lifeNicorette gum worked quickly for me... Smoke free for 8 months "I realized I never smoked at my house, but in my car or my job it was fair game. Once I realized what my triggers were I just changed it to tooth picks and bubble gum. For me it worked, I think it was just something to do while I was doing. ""For me it was jet-lag. I live in Asia and travel to North America once a year or so. When I smoked (I've been quit for about five years) I found that the extreme jet-lag would provide me with two advantages. First,  after 12 hours on a plane, I could give myself a 'fresh start' upon arrival and just not smoke since most of the nicotine was already out of my system. I could then extend it for the next week or so by virtue of the fact that the jet-lag seemed to reset my brain and negate the cravings. The first time, I was able to quit for a whole year without a relapse. The second time it stuck for good. ""Hi intensity Exercise.  You can feel your lungs struggling that first sprint... which is brutal, but a few sprints/days/week later you can feel them improving."I got sick for 10 days (flu) and didn't smoke the whole time. My cough was so horrible that even the thought of smoking made me hack up a lung. The cough lingered a few days after I got better so by the time I could actually smoke again it had been 15 days since I had a cig. The big test was when I was out with friends drinking and also this big snowboarding trip i went on. will power kept me from smoking during those events. good luck "1)  Deciding I wanted to quit because I did not want to smoke anymore and not anyone or anything else.  

2)  Having support for said decision.  Hard to quit smoking if people in your house still smoke around you.

3)  Replacement therapy for the action of smoking.  I realized early on that I was more addicted to the action of smoking than the nicotine.  Not saying nicotine did not play a part, it did, but I was more anxious about what I was going to do instead of smoking because it was such a big part of my life.  I started using Altoids and other mints as a replacement action.  When it came time to give those up later it was a lot easier to do so.

4) COLD TURKEY!  I tried the gradual reduction, but never go to not smoking.  One day I decided that the one I had just smoked was my last and threw out the rest.  

5) Use the High Score method.  This means that every day you don't smoke is another day added onto your current score.  Always try to break your High Score.  If you do wind up smoking at a party or something, then you just get to start over at 0 and work for the High Score again.  Better than the way I always wound up thinking which was more of I lost so why try.  


I will say mine was slightly different than most people.  My wife and I quit at the same time and supported each other.  But we did not quit for each other.  She decided she was done smoking before I did, but kept doing the once a week smoke break with me because that was all the support I could give until I decided I wanted to be done with it.  We tried gradually quitting (which always led to us getting to one or two a week and then just giving in), the patches/lozenges (which did nothing for the problem of the action of smoking), vaping (which didn't do anything at all for us back then), and every other method except pills.  Cold Turkey with the support of each other has us on our 5th year of not smoking now.  "cold turkey"I have never really been a smoker, but I may have a few while I'm out at the bar or something.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, smoked a pack and a half a day. Quitting cold turkey didn't work for him, because a lot of his friends and coworkers smoked and being around it so much drove him to bum one and start up again.

He bought a vaporizer about 10 months ago. He smoked cigarettes for about 2 weeks with it, and then hasn't had a cigarette since. He was using high doses of nicotine at first, but has slowly taking dose down. He's been nicotine free for about a month now, but still uses his vaporizer for the habit and flavor. "I bet my best friend $500. First person to use tobacco owes the other $500. Too broke to smoke and too good of a friend to lie about it :)High end vaporizers/e-cigs. Apt Smoke is awesome first time. Ive went two weeks without cigs in 4 years."I had always planned on quitting by 30, but I was in Hawaii on top of Haleakal and realized that I couldn't breathe for shit at 29.  I was smoking a pack and a half of Spirits a day at that point.  I gradually cut back to a half a pack, then used the gum to take the edge off.  I had to quit drinking for a while as well.  Gradually trained myself to have a beer without a smoke.  I smoked for 17 years, and it's been 6 years now since I quit.  Definitely not easy, but I'm so glad I did it! "I'm surprised I haven't found this anywhere here: Wellbutrin. I started taking that and pretty quickly just didn't give a damn about cigarettes anymore. The social aspect was the hardest part."I just stopped.  I quit smoking dozens, if not hundreds, or times before finally quitting for good.  I tired multiple techniques:  I tried gum, I tried only smoking the worst tasting cigarettes every time i got a craving, I even tried snapping my wrist with a rubber band.  Finally, one day I ran out of cigarettes and didn't buy any more.  The first two weeks were the worst.  Cravings all the time, especially while drinking alcohol, working, or driving.  After first two weeks, the cravings kept coming, but they weren't as bad.  I chewed on pens like mad, and I baby carrots by the pound.  But after a month, the cravings started to ease drastically, I could breath easier, food had more taste...  The first couple weeks are the most brutal, but after a month you are in the home stretch.  That's not to say you won't ever have cravings again.  Once in a great while I still think about smoking.  But at this point, remembering how hard those first two weeks were trump any ideas of having a smoke.

My best advise is to disassociate yourself from anything that reminds you of smoking.  Try not to even talk about it, don't listen to anecdotes from friends about smoking.  Just disassociate as much as possible.  The relapse rate is higher than smokers than it is for heroin addicts for a reason.""seeing so many of my family members act like its perfectly acceptable behavior to light up anywhere...the zoo, a city garden, taking a break from church service to catch a fix. it made me feel so shameful thinking about it that i stopped right after i really started it.""I smoked for 8 years. The way I quit was I started dipping, every time I had a craving I would put a dip in. Once I had completely transferred my cravings to dip, I took my favorite flavor, apple skoal, and dried it out. If you haven't had dried out dip, don't it is gag worthy. When I had a craving I would put the dried skoal in and instead of spitting I forced myself to swallow, after about eighth time I'd thrown up from it, I never had a desire again. To test myself I bought another, fresh, can of apple skoal and kept it on my person for over a month. At no point in time did I have a desire to open it up. ""Don't give up! It took me several attempts to quit as well (dipping tobacco/snus for about 4 years). I don't exactly know how many times I tried (between 10-20), but each time it only lasted for about a day or two. I have now been tobacco free for almost two months. If you can get beyond that first week or two, then everything will be good :).

Chewing gum has helped me to manage the times when I started thinking of relapsing. Not nicotine gum, just regular Wrigley's spearmint. It helps me with the oral fixation that developed as a result of tobacco use. "Money. If you're poor you can't afford cigs"I substituted for electronic cigarettes. Within two weeks I had completely ceased cigarettes.  
The trick with vaping is getting the right model, finding a flavour you enjoy, and getting used to the different feeling on the draw.""I knew it was time for me to quit, started smoking at age 18 and want to quit when I was 25. I switched from my brand (Marlboro lights) to just roll-your-own cheap TOPS tobacco. When I got down to the last dregs of the pouch and would smoke the rolled cig with the stale tobacco the negative aspects of the last smoke's experience (stale dry taste) became greater than the positive aspects (freshness + nicotine) of the first smoke's aspects from a fresh pack. I was able to wean myself off and quit after a couple weeks. 10 years later thinking of cigs and the first thought that comes to my mind is not the nice fresh raisin-y smell of a fresh Marb but rather that dried stale awful smell of the bottom of a TOPS bag.""Honestly, it was two fold. 
I tried quitting for my wife and ended up smoking again. Then one day I went for a run. Not far just a normal run and when I got home I literally looked and felt like death. I couldn't breathe, my face was swollen and red. Then and there I knew I didn't want to die from smoking. It's not worth it. 
So, (and yes I know what people will say) I started dipping skoal pouches. I think dipping is disgusting and so I only did it in situations where I would have smoked. I slowly weaned myself off of Skoal with Snus pouches. Again only when I needed to smoke. Slowly I had the urge less and less. 
Now I haven't smoked in years, and only used a single pouch of Snus on really bad days where I know I would smoke. 
I had friends that tried the nicotine gum but it's so damn expensive that I used the Snus instead. it was a cheaper alternative. 
I will say this with a disclaimer though. I only was successful using mouth tobacco because I did not enjoy it and found it disgusting. I have had friends that tried it and now they smoke and/or are addicted to mouth tobacco. So, be cautious if you try this route. Don't get addicted to the alternative.     ""Keep smoking pack after pack until you vomit. Do this once a day for a week. After said week you will either be dead, or you will have successfully conditioned yourself to hate smoking. ""I quit using the Chantix medication, I've been quit for four years. I know a lot of people had very negative reactions to Chantix but I was not one of them, the only side effects I had was if I didn't eat enough it made me extremely nauseous and it gave me weird vivid dreams. You still have to REALLY want to quit even with that medication, another thing that helped me was alienating all of my smoker friends until I was well over the hump. Sometimes I get the urge to smoke still when I see people smoke, but once I smell it that urge quickly goes away.""In a failed attempt to quit about 10 years ago, my wife prescribed me Chantix to help.  The weird vivid nightmares I had bordered on psychological torture; some were so traumatic, they were difficult to discern from reality the following day.  I caution any and everyone considering it to beware, but mileage varies wildly, it seems.  I know people who swear by it."Apparently liver injury creates an aversion to nicotine. I got acute liver injury after a pretty short alcohol/drug binge and I ended up being disgusted with cigarettes after. I've been 3 years smoke free."My wife's grandpa recently died of cancer. He was trying to fight it with chemo, I took him for a check up at the hospital once and while I parked the car he smoked by the entrance.  He seemed to be doing better and the cancer was shrinking so we were thinking we would have little bit more time to see his great grandchildren (my wife and my sister in law are pregnant and due in July). Then around Christmas he took a turn for the worse and the cancer sprang back and he really didn't look good. 
He was in the hospital for a few days until he demanded to go home. The next day he was in his home lying in bed and the family all came over knowing he didn't have long. The day seemed to drag on and it felt weird being there knowing we were all just waiting for him to die. Well in the early evening around 4 pm my wife's mother called us into his room and we stood around him as he passed. 
Now anytime I have to urge to smoke I just think of him and standing there watching him go. This happened only a few weeks ago so I'm hoping I can keep it up but I really don't have much of a craving anymore, only when I drink really so that's when I use that memory. ""I smoked cigarettes for 10 years.  At my peak I was at a pack a day.  To quit I smoked weed every time I wanted a cigarette for a month.   It actually worked quite well, especially since you only need to smoke a small amount of pot if you have access to some half decent hydro.  This might not be a practical solution for you however.  "Quitting cold-turkey is definitely the way to go. I got my SO on board so the added benefit of not wanting to disappoint her is what really helped me."I know it's worthless posting this after there's already 5600 comments, but I'll throw it out there anyway, never to be seen.

I quit with a friend.  We made a bet where the next person to smoke had to buy two full cartons.  (Because, let's be honest, if you smoke one, you're going to smoke those two cartons anyway.)

No one ever ""starts smoking again"" like it's something they plan to do.  They say they've quit, but rationalize just this one.  Then you rationalize one here and there, but you've still ""quit smoking"".  It's not until after the tenth one you've rationalized that you realize you've ""started smoking again"".  It's kind of like an economic depression.  You can't say you've been in one until after it's over.

The key to the bet is that it's hard to rationalize a $100 cigarette.  It makes you face the fact up front that you're giving up on quitting.

""I stopped buying smokes. 

Sure I borrowed one from a friend now and then but after a while I became tired of borrowing."E-cig worked for me.-Will power and electronic cigarettes till the cravings slowly stopped. "My dad was a smoker for about 40 years. He's been using e-cigs for a few months now, and he basically smokes one or two cigarettes a week - down from a pack a day. They work for him, but I get that they're not for everyone.

He and my sister quit at roughly the same time. She had been smoking for about 10 years. What worked for her is those pills that make cigarettes just not work/make you sick - I forget what they're called, and I think you need a prescription for them. She uses those, combined with an app that gives you cool stats and accomplishments. It tells you how much money you saved, how much damage to your lungs has been healed, by how much you've reduced your risk of cancer etc... She too is way down in her cigarette consumption. She's is in health care (ER nurse), and gets zero breaks, but maybe the medical info is more helpful to her, since she has a real understanding of the consequences. The app seems to be really motivating for her.""My dad died of cancer shortly before I quit and at the same time I realized when I went out on the porch to smoke my son was watching me through the window (he was 7 at the time). I felt shame for influencing someone into the habit and stupid for doing something that contributed to my dad's death and yet, there I was, doing the same thing. 

I quit cold turkey. I forgave myself if I slipped and just made sure to stay stronger in the future. It got easier around the 2 month mark. I also had a great support network that encouraged me and I used a 1-800 quit line. The quit line didn't help so much at it gave me a random person I reported to, but for some reason telling a stranger that I had slipped on an urge helped me refocus my intent. ""My theory on giving up something is that the people who do give up the addiction do it because they want to.

Those who say they do, but don't, really didn't want to give up. You might know that it's bad for your health, but if you don't want to give it up, then you're going to fail no matter what you do. 

It's the difference between *thinking* you want to or should do something and literally wanting to do something.

Would you do something that you *do* want to do? Yes.

Would you do something that you don't want to do? No. 

If you don't want to smoke, then you will stop smoking. 

Everything in between smoking and not smoking are just companies trying to make money from you. e.g. e-cigarettes, patches, books, pills. Don't buy into that shit. Your brain is the only thing stopping you.

I'm not saying this works for everyone but when I've given up various things it's because I didn't want to do it any more. e.g. I don't want to waste my, I don't want to hurt my health, I don't want to hurt other people. All these have been reasons to stop doing various things during my life.

Let's say I want to quit on November 1st. I'll stop buying cigs a month before that day, and I'll let my friends know in advance. I can still smoke them, but throughout October I cannot buy or possess them. I can bum them from friends (and I do favors to pay them back, sometimes just buy them a pack). Eventually I feel so guilty for bumming them that I'll only smoke when i REALLY need one. By the end of the month I won't smoke unless it's a dire emergency, and I'll find that I can go a couple days without. Then by the time November 1st hits I'll be prepared. 

I should also note that I live in Chicago...$11 a pack. That makes it easier to quit too""Was in a relationship where my partner ( smoker of 20yr) and hearing the daily morning hacking and wheezing was bad but I still did it. Then I started working in the hospital and seeing 30/40/50 yr smokers and how their selective lung disease affected their quality of life, still smoked but just at social occasions. Then I got a small respiratory infection but I was already sick from something else, the small thing lead to the big respiratory infection ( pneumonia). I was inches within being admitted to the hospital because I progressively destroyed all the parts of my lungs designated to get gunk out of my lungs. I lost 20 lbs while I was sick ( all muscle that took 8 months of diligent exercise to get ). When I wasted away and laterally felt like seat was upon me is when I swore I would never smoke again. That said I have 1 or 2 a month but that is a very rare occurrence. TLDR:  it destroyed my gains from the gym and I could not breath for 3 weeks w/o oxygen therapy ""Relevant

I warned my coworkers before I quit and apologized ahead of time if I was grumpy for the next couple days. After two weeks I didn't really want one anymore and after a month the smell started to make me gag. My advice is to just quit, don't do any last hurrah kind of thing either, just one morning when you wake up say 'today's the day.' You have to want to quit though, otherwise you'll start again."I've just recently quit myself after a  handful of failed attempts over the last 5 years. It's been almost 3 months since my last puff and the only thing that worked was going turkey. Letting the nicotine left in you system works it way out takes about a month. Then you have to fight the cravings and the sick comes with that. My mantra is I am stronger than my cravings I don't need them I can live better without them. And the cravings will pass and will come fewer and fewer it takes time and true purseverance. Don't keep track of how much time goes by between craving s it just helps your nicotine starved mind to rationalize having a smoke....ie....oh its been 3 days o should reward myself by having a smoke. Just keep with it Smoked for 6 years and quit cold turkey.   It's all mental after the first 2-3 days. "I think bad breath was the main reason, so embarrassing. "" I grew up in Auckland, New Zealand. Alot of teens smoke. I started when I was fourteen at the back of my high school gym because an EX-friend asked if I wanted a puff. Ofcourse I wasn't hooked from that moment but after a couple of months of lazy cigs I smoked more and more. I just turned seventeen last week and haven't had a cigarette since Dec 20th 2013 and I'm feeling good.

What truly made me quit was my personal training. I've always been athletic but smoking made it torture. That burn in my throat and chest... NOPE. Goodbye tobacco, we are over. I have Mary Jane anyway <3"Recondition your brain into thinking of it as poison. It took me a while but they make me physically ill now"I play rugby and having to run after smoking before practice sucked so much I haven't smoked anything in over 4 years and I no longer have a desire to. 
Moral is you have to be able to breathe to play sports""I'd attempted quitting multiple times, with in a few years, before. With different reasons and motivations in mind; the cost, own health and such. Best one been six months with barely any random cigs.

But what did the trick was my then girlfriend, now wife, getting pregnant. We both quit, she on the same day and i decided to quit after midsummers, just a few days after.
2,5 smoke free years later, there's no reason to go back.

I also quit drinking and smoking cannabis at the same time.
Sure I'll have a drink or two if I'm out, but i barely ever do. 
So I'm sure that helps too. ;)""I quit cold turkey three years ago. I had smoked on and off for years after my kids were born, but never in front of them. I would smoke at work, after they went to bed, etc... Then, three years ago I took a week off work to take care of my kids during March break. After spending the full week with them not being able to smoke there really wasn't a point in going back. 

Now I participate in various sports and feel better than ever. ""My best friend's new GF wasn't a big fan of his smoking, though she did accept it. He took it upon himself to quit for her. 

He quit using one of those vapor pens. It was kind of odd. He literally switched one day and never went back. Slowly he reduced the nicotine concentration and now he says he doesn't even crave it any more.""Not a smoker but here's what worked for both of my parents.

My mother has quit smoking two times, the first time she used to chew bubble gum whenever she felt the urge to smoke. Second time she quit was purely with strength of will.

For my father, the requirements for him to stop smoking were a bit more complicated. His best friend passed away due to lung cancer. He went to have his lungs checked shortly afterwards and learned that he'd share the same fate if he didn't stop smoking immediately, and so he did.""My mom was hypnotised and hasn't had one since that session. She'd smoked for 30 years, 20 a day and says she feels like she's never smoked, has never had a craving for one. This was 6 years ago. ""Motivation and support, I know ""it's cliche"" but that's really what it took for me. Girl I was dating didn't want me smoking, (we broke up 2 months in that's not the point) but I have tons of support from friends and family. No one would let me bum cigarettes off of them. Quit cold turkey. One of the top 5 decisions of my life this far."Electronic cigarettes helped me."I quit smoking cold turkey after 5 years. I realized I was paying $5-6 a day to literally kill myself. About a week before my 19th birthday I quit. I'm now about a year and a half off of them, and I feel a million times better!""After people I knew started getting copd and shit. I had already quit and failed at least 20 times so I kept trying and finally I just managed to follow through.
""Pick up an intensive habit. I just quit smoking two months ago after 5 years of smoking. The morning after I smoked my last cigarette, I started running. I started exercising every day, doing a lot of calisthenics. I also started eating much better, and cut down on meat consumption, which is another big help in quitting.""I got married to a non smoker.  I quit cold turkey on our wedding day.  I cheated a few times after with my smoker friend while drinking, but after a year the cravings go away.  I've been a non smoker since 2009 and I don't even think about it anymore."The simple answer is you have to want to. If your hearts not in it you will fail time and time again. I tried for years to quit and it wasn't until I knew I was going to be a father that I truly wanted to quit. Took me a couple months on an electronic one and then that one was a lot easier to step down and get off of. Simple fact of the matter is you can't quit until you really want to deep down. The temptation will pull you back in every time."I went on a week long camping trip and ran out of cigarettes by day two. I was too far to get more so I went almost 5 days without. When I got back I decided to give quitting a try. The hardest moments are when drunk, after coffee, and after food. At first I even had issues with bowel movements. I just stuck through it. I also used ecigs the first month during drinking as an alternative. Just try to find other things to occupy you at your weakest. And remember, once a smoker always a smoker meaning you may crave cigarettes occasionally for the rest of your life but saying no gets easier and easier every time."My father had a massive stroke and it scared the living hell out of me. Went from 60 a day to 0. Been 10 years. Feel much better."I smoked a pack a day through my mid twenties before quitting a couple years ago.  Prior to actually quitting cold turkey, I had a few failed attempts, the longest lasting a couple of months.

For me, the first three days were the most physically demanding.  It was pretty much one seventy two hour craving, and I got very little sleep.  Because my willpower is shit -- case in point, I have work I should be doing right now -- I got through the first three days by holing up in my apartment and watching a shit ton of movies. (Pro-tip: steer clear of film noir.) 

After that, I'd run up against fairly frequent, intense cravings.  The key to dealing with them is going to be particular to you, and how you smoke now.  Though I say I smoked a pack a day, for example, that number was considerably higher when I went out.  When I drank, I pretty much chained smoked.  The two went hand in hand.  And when I hung out with friends who also smoked, I tended to smoke more.

Although you can't control when your cravings pop up, you can minimize the chance that you'll have one in a high risk situation, one where you generally really like to smoke and cigarettes are handy.  For me, this meant drinking a lot less the first couple of months, and spending a lot less time at a certain friend's place.

At this point, I should say that quitting is going to entail a certain amount of social awkwardness, or at least for me.  In the case of my friend, I explained it straightforwardly -- I told him I'm trying to quit smoking, and because I have zero willpower, that makes not putting myself in situations where I'm tempted to smoke more.  I made a point of saying I wasn't doing it because I was now a *superior non-smoking being*, but because, again, zero will power.  He took it fine.

The good news is that as time passes, you have fewer and fewer cravings.  After a couple of months of going out way less, I gradually eased back into things.  Two years later, I only occasionally have cravings, and I can be surrounded by people smoking without feeling like I'm in danger of falling off the wagon.

Just remember, this isn't a short term thing you're embarking on.  It's going to be a lifelong project, and it's going to entail changing a lot of habits you've built up over time, some of which you might not even be aware of right now.

Final word of warning: once you have quit for a while, and you're no longer dealing with omnipresent cravings, don't make the mistake of thinking you can just enjoy a smoke.  If you're anything like me, you'll either proceed to go through a whole pack, or else not get much sleep for the next few days while your curse your momentary stupidity. 

For that reason, I think quitting cold turkey will actually be easier on you.  I know a lot of what worked for me doesn't really apply to you -- unless you win the lottery you can't exactly just stop going to work for two months -- but I'd still say look to your habits and your routine, and figure out what changes you can make that will make it easier for you.

All the best, dude."I stopped buying cigarettes. "I find that I disagree with most of you here.
I used to smoke a bigpack a day (25cigs)  and had tried to quit several times.  Then i read the Book by Allan Carr which made me realise that willpower is not really a solution.

 Willpower had helped me quit several months, several times.  However, as long as you still consider it something that you enjoy, you will never be free from it.

That is the transition from exsmoker to nonsmoker. 
Smokers all have a psychological knot implanted in their brain, whether it gets there by your surroundings, marketing, self image or whatever it may be. You can only untie it if you understand exactly why you are addicted and why you consider this costly nasty habit to be something beneficial, something that is considered a treat.

Once you see it clearly for what it is, an ugly weakness, then its very easy to step away from. The first three days will feel a little strange, your hands will be fidgety and everything will seem slightly longer, but its just bothersome not in any way painful or uncomfortable.

Willpower is more of a topical cream to the problem. What you really need is a deep going cure.
I can only point towards the book. 

Havent smoked for 9 years now, and smelling the smoke just disgusts me now. 

Strangely though when i smoke a joint it doesnt bother me. 
""One day you just say, ""no more.""""Pick up heroin.  No wait shit, all the people I know that do opiates smoke like fiends.  Uhh...stamp collecting?

Best way to quit smoking for real: Don't pick up a habit in the first place.  So many I know picked it up b/c they just wanted to try it or wanted something to do with friends when they were on smoke breaks and got addicted.  My friend actually started with ecigs (non-nicotine liquid) and is now a smoker...we keep telling him he's an idiot.""Stay busy. Replace it with a healty habbit that can also release stress. No, not masturbation.""Back in 2012 I was hospitalized for two weeks, and diagnosed with kidney failure.When I was released, I tried smoking a cigarette, and it tasted horrible. After that, I'm happy to say I haven't had the urge to smoke one since. ""You haven't gotten the ""right"" ecig for you, 

Come on over to /r/electronic_cigarette

We can help""E-Cigs!!!!!!!!

They are simply amazing.  

I was a pack a day smoker for almost 15 years. 
Quit smoking cigarettes completely the day I got it.""I went cold turkey, from 20 a day. Got on a plane to Australia and gave up. Got loads of chewing gum to keep my mouth busy. Haven't touched a cigarette in 6 years now ""I tried that exact same method. Flew to Australia, first thing I did there was buy a 30 dollar pack of cigarettes.""So I bought a couple disposable ecigs to try...NJOY and BLU. While I'm good with the flavor, I find their ""equals 2 packs"" is never the case for me. I guess it's because unlike a regular smoke, where you eventually put out what little remains, I find I continuously puff on an ecig. I like not smelling of smoke but the price is too much. And there seems to be so many kit choices, it's a bit intimidating... Is this all normal?""Deciding I really wanted to quit. Acknowledging how nasty it made everything around me, and how it cost far more than I was getting out of it. It really clicked all at once.

I can smoke one or two here and there, when I have some drinks, and that's enough. There's no pull to chain smoke or keep a pack on hand. It was purely mental for me.""This thread makes me want a cigarette
"This is exactly what I've been thinking while I read it."Fear. Think about dying, like a lot. 

Also - when i absolutely needed nicotine i actually used chewing tobacco to take the edge off. That is something you cannot do in public a lot - if you think there's a stigma attached to smoking, try spitting tar in front of people... That pretty much did it.""Tried cold turkey 5 times, patch once, gum twice, meds twice, flu that almost put me in the hospital once. Then I tried ecigs.  (btw; I was a pack and half smoker for 25 years.  And up to 3 packs a day sometimes in college.)


These deal with the nic cravings, horrible taste, heart racing, or psychotic dreams. Plus there are some great flavors and its easier to wean off the nic. But there is a learning curve, and there is some upfront expenses, but overall I am very happy.

And I smell like donuts all the time.  Vaping FTW.  Obligatory /r/electronic_cigarette, those folks really helped picking out equipment, good deals, juice recommendations, and fear calming."I used the patch and carried a lighter with me all the time. I did this twice. The second time I was moving and I noticed it was a smoke free building. I lived upstairs and didn't want to go downstairs and out to the sidewalk to smoke."In all honesty, it was my son being born. I smoked for 7 years. I tried patches and all sorts of gums. I ended up trying Chantix and it made me dizzy with nausea. 

One day I was outside on the back porch and my son crawled to the back door (full glass pane on the door) and looked at me......he watched the smoke float away from my mouth and I knew right there it was time.

I ended up just quitting cold turkey and it's been almost 5 years now. After you quit for a few months it isn't so bad and the first time a smoker sits next to you......it will make you vomit when you smell them.....""Oddly enough, I've quit smoking a few times, once for several years.  Force of will made it happen the first few times, and it gets easier (for me) as I went.  You did it once, you can do it again.  

Later on, though, I noticed one of my antidepressants had a massive impact as well:  Wellbutrin rather neatly kills the urge, at one point I had one or two cigarettes per day....when I remembered.

I actually still smoke, currently, oddly enough, more because I actually enjoy it, though, rather than any urge, (I have no problem going from my current five to eight a day to nothing for a few if, say, its too damn cold, or I have something more important to do right then.)

Thinking about it, I would suppose that, like almost everything about us human beings, willpower is something that needs to be exercised to be properly effective, and if you're not using it, you're losing it. (I've often said similar about mental power/capacity and skills, not just muscles.)

So quit for a day, then two a little later, then more as you can manage it.  Don't beat yourself up for not being tobacco free in one day, just consider it practice for when you do finally quit, and we all know practice makes perfect.  Get used to the nic fits (I got to where I actually enjoyed it...), and use the experience to ready yourself for the day you decide to quit for good.

Not really a matter of ""If you quit"", but ""When you quit"", and make sure you don't forget it!"/r/electronic_cigarette and an actual e-cig did the trick. Smoke free since October 2013! Whohoo!!"I smoked for 16 years and tried and failed a number of times. 5 years ago I used Chantix. I think it may have helped a little but the biggest thing was to recognize that withdrawal fucking sucks. I still want to have cigarettes occasionally but I choose not to right now. I expect I will want to have one every now and then, I just choose not to right now. "Electronic cigarettes. Not the shitty ones that look like actual cigarettes."My voice went bad so tried again for umpteenth time. Tried hypnosis - failed, so went cold turkey. Used candy lemon drops so much I developed mouth sores. In 2 weeks the buzz was off and never looked back. I was too late - lung surgery 7 years later. Been quite a while and still around and kicking. Just quit - regardless of the discomfort."I smoke a vaporiser or as some call it an electric cigarette. I still get  nicotine but its not as harmful to me. I think lol. "**Electronic cigarette.**

I have smoked for over 24 years and I will never smoke a nasty ass cigarette again.  

I quit several times over my 20+ years.  I quit a few tinmes off the patch, a few times I got too sick to smoke, once I was in jail, but I always *eventually* went back to smoking    

I always wanted a cigarette after quitting.  Eventually, I would have one.  Then another, then another and then I would be back smoking regularly.  

I quit cold turkey 2 years ago, and still wanted to smoke.  Someone recommended an electronic cigarette for the urges, so i took their adive, did some research and got an electronic cigarette.  After trying the electronic cigarette, **vaping** I wondered why I didn't make the switche sooner.  

So, head on over to /r/electronic_cigarette and get started on a new clean road.  You will never look back at cigarettes.    



""Get a bronchial infection that makes smoking difficult/painful and it forces you to pretty much hate smoking. The key is having the will power to not smoke as soon as you get better. 

I really don't recommend this path, but it worked for me. "For me it was going out with people who didn't smoke. I could make it through the week without a cigarette but one beer and I would bum from the first person I saw."Quit cold turkey. No e-cigs. Do not make a plan. Just quit on a random day and try to carry it forward day by day. Breathe deeply for about 10 to 20 times whenever you feel the urge to smoke. **IT IS NOT EASY**. The withdrawal symptoms, especially if you're a heavy smoker, are terrible. Be strong."E-cigs"My desire to get in shape. I ran half a mile as a ""tester"" one night after smoking for 13 years. Coughed incredibly hard for about 3 hours and even spewed up some strange little balls that I swear came straight from my lungs. Been clean almost a year now. I used the e-cigs to ween myself off the nicotine.""It helped me to combine a number of factors.

1. Start small by practicing the idea of ""having a cigarette later"". Delay a smoke by an hour once in a while for a few weeks. Then bump that up to two hours, three hours, half a work day, etc....

2. Keep an open pack of cigarettes at your desk that you never touch. Get used to the idea of looking at and being around cigs and conditioning yourself to not pick them up.

3. Plan ahead for nights out where you know you'll smoke. While there, practice the same mentality but on a smaller scale. Skip a cigarette for five minutes, then another for ten minutes, etc.

4. After a couple of months you might be able to go a few days without a smoke. Push it for a week or more as you feel comfortable doing. If you make it to two weeks, you're GOLD. After that, if you break down and want a smoke, take one from that open pack at your desk. By then they'll be stale and gross and everytime you smoke it'll taste like someone took a dump in your mouth. 

Good luck!"I just quit this year and have been smoking for 7 years. Me and my SO quit together and she used Champex and it worked for her. I first cut down to 3 smokes day for the first week. After I could do that I cut down to 2 for about 4 days. I did 1 a day for about a week then just stopped completely. I also got people I work with to tell me that i couldn't do it and that drove me to prove them wrong."After my mother died of cancer, I never smoked again. I just decided I wouldn't smoke and didn't. I found I had to change some of my routines that involved smoking to survive and I took on some lesser vices like coffee and ritualized those as a substitute.""not me but my mom forced my brother to quit with one simple agreement.
She found cigarettes in my brothers pockets there was only like 4 left, she said you can smoke as much as you want if you can EAT the rest of your cigarettes. If you can you can smoke if you can't you cannot smoke. He only finished 1, never smoked again. ""changing jobs and changing routines helped me. I started a new job, told no one I used to be a smoker and watched the 'cool kids' of the office laughing outside on their breaks, but I didn't give in.""**Get your wisdom teeth pulled!** You're not supposed to smoke for I believe 48hrs, and you're on pain meds and hopefully sleeping a lot. When the threat of a dry socket = more pain you'll go forever without smoking. Once that threat is over you're already well on your way to cold turkey quitting. Yes, the first week or so sucks. But it gets easier. 

For me I found the addiction was easy enough to get over. What wasn't easy to get over the gaps in your life from not smoking. Non smokers fail to realize how much time smoking uses up. Bored? Step outside and kill 5 minutes watching the world while smoking. Finished a big meal? Nothing like stepping outside to light on up. Stuck in traffic? Drinking? You get the idea. When you smoke you set time aside to do those things, but just because you quit doesn't mean you automatically have something to fill those times. 

The other important thing, is to not cheat. Seriously, treat it like heroin or some other massively addictive drug/vice. For the first year plus, smoking will still seem at least in some way ok in your mind. There's still part of you that identifies with smokers as you were one up until recently. I've had far too many friends go for six months+, go to a party, be drunk, have a cig and just hop right back on the smoking train. You cannot cheat, it's never ""just one drag"" ""I'm just going to have one."" Try and be an adult and realize how you became a smoker all those years ago in the first place. 

TL;DR Smoke free 4 years now, 5year smoker before that. Wisdom teeth or other dental work, don't cheat and have ""just one.""""Cold turkey. Best friend (a handsome, fit 36 year old), heavy smoker, went into hospital to have fluid removed from lungs. Didn't come out. Convinced me to stop smoking that day over 35 years ago. Tore up all packs around house and flushed down toilet. Haven't touched one since! ""My bong, gave me something to take the edge off.""A good quality personal vaporizer ""aka"" ecig""I quit after smoking for 3-4 years so most long time smoker dismiss my advice with a ""yeah but I have been smoking for  10 years so you have no idea,"" and maybe that is true but here is what worked for me and a few others I have motivated to quit.

Number 1. You have to REALLY want to quit. Don't just quit because you are suppose to or was told to or else you will cave in first smoke that is offered to you. Do it for yourself and want it for your health

2. Set a quit date. It's difficult to just up and quit but if you set a dye you can make sure you get all your packs finished and got your fill because the next step is the hardest.

3. DONT SMOKE! The best advice I could give and have done myself is remember that if you have a cigarette in your hand you have already lost. You can't quit smoking by bumming a drag or having the odd cigarette here and there. Some have done it but it is this lack of commitment that has caused most my friends to start smoking again. Some offers ALWAYS say no because if you want to quit that should be the only response. 

These steps worked for me and while I'm sure some people have slowly cut down I can say te majority of people on my experience CAN NOT manage that. If you want this then a smoke should not ever need to touch your hands again.""Gradually weaned myself off of cigarettes after smoking for 35 years. This was after cutting back a few years earlier from 1 å? - 2 packs a day to less than 1 pack a day. Every step in cutting back seemed to reinforce how easy it was to do without cigarettes. The first step to consciously cut back was when I moved into a new house, I decided not to smoke inside, and it was pretty easy, could still smoke outside. At one point I stopped carrying cigarettes with me wherever I went, which was still not too bad. Made it to the point where I was able to drive an hour to a trailhead and hike for six hours and drive back home without having a cigarette or even without carrying any with me. Not too hard because I was doing something non stressful that I enjoyed. 

The biggest step was when I stopped smoking at work. Walking in one winter day there were people standing on the sidewalk outside of my building in wind driven, vertical, freezing rain, dragging on cigarettes ÛÒ no way was I going to do that. That was a bit more challenging, but I just chewed mints instead. The last step was after returning from a long weekend trip I realized that I had only smoked 6 cigarettes during the entire 4 days. On the first day back I bought some nicotine gum, stocked up on Altoids, and tossed all of my cigarettes and I havenÛªt smoked since. Was on the gum for a month or so, and chewed mints until I started getting cavities, but since April of 2007 I havenÛªt had a cigarette. Yeah!
""Another vote for cold turkey here.  

I tried the patch two different times and just tapering off other times by smoking less. They're all crutches and string the process out longer than it needs to be. I had done OK and had gotten myself down to only about 5 or 6 a day for a couple of months.  Then UT was playing in the Big 12 Championship game and we partied and tailgated all day long.  I drank a lot that day and seriously smoked almost 2 packs of smokes.  I woke up the next morning with a serious hangover and a very sore throat.  It felt like my throat had swollen up to about the thickness of a pencil, and on top of the soreness, I was really wheezy.  It was easy to see that morning the direct result that smoking was having on my body.  I never smoked another cigarette.  I had also just started dating a *really* cute girl at the time who hated smoking, and so if we were out drinking and I started to get a bit weak, she would say something like, ""if you smoke tonight, don't think you're going to get any kisses tonight""...that sort of thing.  Very effective.  """"I'm not going to have one right now, maybe later tonight or in the day or tomorrow, not not ever again in my life, I'm just not going to have one right now""
"Chantex or however you spell it helped my boss and she smoked like 6+ cig a dayI read - The easy way to quit smoking by Allan Carr. Tried everything from hypnotherapy to e cigarettes but this book was the only thing that helped. Mostly because it explains the subliminal reasons and triggers on why you smoke.

One day a few months ago I forgot to buy a pack, was kinda irritated because I went through the motions of my day but without the same habit, so my hands felt awkward. Forgot to buy them the next day and ended up being too busy to worry about it. 3rd day I started having coughing fits from not smoking and my lungs were irritated. About 5 days in I realized I haven't smoked in almost a week and decided to not get cigarettes, which ended up reminding me I wanted a cigarette -_- But I never left the house because it was too cold and I was too lazy. Few days more and I realized I'd rather keep going without smoking and now it's been almost 3 months without buying a pack.

Occasionally I do bum a smoke from a friend if I'm drinking, but now it's not a habit but an indulgence. It's a treat instead of an addiction, kinda like having a cigar to celebrate or after good food at a nice place with friends. I don't get the urge to smoke, nor do I buy a pack after having one smoke from someone. Plus, the nicotine high you get after not having one for so long is very nice. 

Smoke of choice: Camel Crush. I don't care for the tobacco but the menthol tastes ""fresh"". The regular menthol cigarettes taste a little stale and artificial. "I had to quit coffee and cigarettes *at the same time* since one couldn't be had without the other. Nowadays I drink the occasional cup of coffee but always somewhere I can't smoke. I wanted it."Chantix
""I lost my job in November. A dream company of mine granted me an interview. However, they have a ""no-nicotine"" policy. Meaning I would have to pass a nicotine test to gain employment. This also meant no nicotine replacements. I had to make a mental decision to stop smoking so I could better my life by landing this job. The first three days my mind constantly wandered to cigs. I had a lot of support by friends saying ""nah you don't need them."" By day 5 the cravings massively subsided. At this point I don't think I would pick up another one because I finally feel free! Not to mention amazing all around. Long story short. I had to make a tough choice and mentally stick to it. So, cold turkey. 
""Personally I had quit a few times for abou a year at a time. Finally got fed up and sold my paid off BMW for a bicycle. I rode 8miles each way to work rain or shine, never smoked since and was two years in November. Didn't get a car til a full year later, but still love riding my bike. ""I had been a smoker for 8 years, and a friend of mine got me to invest in an eCig package. I used this in place of smoking pretty heavily for the first 3 months of not smoking. Now using the eCig is pretty rare (I only really indulge when I am drinking), and I've been cigarette free because of it for almost 8 months now.""If you want to quit, you can quit. If you don't want to and you're doing it for someone/something else, the process will be difficult or impossible. 

I quit cold turkey after reading Alan Carr's 'The easy way to quit smoking'
He doesn't tell you anything groundbreaking in the book, you just need to understand that you're an addict. 

Quenched cravings with exercise and increased water consumption. ""I did use the patch for three days, just to overcome the nicotine part, but went cold turkey after that. Every time I craved a cigarette really bad,
I chomped a little handful of almonds. I read that the texture of crunchy food satisfies the same oral fixation art of the habit of smoking. Quit September 2008. ""I had already quit for the most part, but still had crazy cravings and the occasional puff. I started the antidepressant Wellbutrin (for reasons not related to smoking) and within about a week or so, I was walking to work and passed a smoker on the corner near my office. I just about threw up right there. It was the most disgusting smell I had ever encountered. An unintended side effect of Wellbutrin is smoking cessation (they now prescribe Zyban for that, but itÛªs the same damn thing). Seriously, if anyone wanted to quit smoking, I canÛªt recommend it enough. IÛªve been off the Welbutrin since March 2013 and I still have absolutely zero desire smoke. Of course, you need to read the other side effects of the drug and talk to a doctor. The reason I stopped taking Wellbutrin was because I has a seizure directly caused by it. A very small percentage of people experience seizures while on it, but usually only because of being on a high dosage (I was on the highest my doctor could prescribe for my weight). "patches and a shitload of willpower"I haven't quit, I've just postponed my next cigarette for the last 14 years. A craving last about 13 minutes, so if you can have a planned distraction for 15-20 minutes to take your mind off the craving you can get through each craving 1 at the time. It is important to distract yourself from the craving, because satisfying and resisting the craving both reinforce the craving and make sure it returns."Not me but my father had been a smoker for 15 years. He saw me imitating him with chopsticks when I was a baby and it changed him. The only success stories I've heard are from doing it cold turkey.  Switching to gum or e-cigs or patches are the equivalent of an alcoholic who drinks whiskey switching to beer or wine.  Nicotine withdrawal will not kill you (though you'll convince yourself it will in the middle of it)."I decided recently that I didn't want to spend any more moeye on them. While I do enjoy smoking, it's too damn expensive. So I bought those little patches and got myself a gym membership with my friends. Every night we go after work and it keeps my mind off wanting to smoke. I used to smoke all the time at work. Now on my breaks I've picked up the Game of Thrones series and I'll read a book instead. Basically you need to do something that occupies your mind during times when you normally smoke. However, if you do try the patches, I have found that they disrupt your sleep schedule. While I haven't had a cig in almost 2 weeks, I haven't slept well either. ""Well I had wanted to quit for awhile so after a girlfriend had dumped me I focused all the anger and contempt I had for her into not having a cigarette (because, you see, if I had a smoke, she won) so after 7 years and 3 failed attempts I successfully quit smoking and haven't had one in two years. To add, she dumped me on new years eve so it was also part of a resolution that I actually stuck to.""Simple, actually making the decision to quit, that's it, it's easy from there as long you know what you want (to quit smoking). ""I was a pack and half guy for twenty years.  I tried at least 5 times and quit and failed.  I finally was able to do it with Chantix.  It blocks the nicotine from interacting with your brain.  So if you do have a cigarette, it's like drinking decaf.  You don't feel the effects of the cigarette and it also made them taste weird to me.  I had some side effects like upset stomach and crazy vivid dreams but I stuck with it and stopped.  It's been 6 years now.  That's about 65,000 cigarettes not smoked.  However you try to do it, just keep trying!  Best of luck to you.""Threw my pack out the window before a 13 hr drive from Columbus, OH to Boston,  MA. FIgured if i can make it that far, I was fine. I was. 3 years quit. No desire. 

Was having chest pains before that for awhile. Scared me. ""One day when I was at work a guy I was super into and who knew I had been trying unsuccessfully to quit smoking for over a month came over to say hi and give me a hug. The first thing he said to me when he let go of me was ""Doing a bad job of quitting smoking huh? I can smell it all over you"" I embarrassingly laughed it off then but then and there I decided I was done and quit cold turkey. I haven't smoked in over four months. It took something so seemingly small to change my entire life.""Quit buying cigarettes.  Quit bumming cigarettes.  Stop putting cigarettes in your mouth and lighting them.  If you find yourself totally incapable of following these simple rules, then you're not tired enough of smoking and you will likely smoke until the misery outweighs the pleasure.  I'm in my mid 40's now, and almost none of my friends smoke anymore.  Most of us used to smoke.  I tried everything from gum to acupuncture.  The thing that worked was flipping the switch in my brain and telling myself I wasn't going to be a fucking loser huddled next to other losers on a sidewalk inhaling tobacco smoke.  

Cold Turkey.  There's really only about 3-4 days of physical misery where time stands still.  If you get past that physical aspect of it, then it's just mental.  It's not about being ""strong"" or ""weak,"" it's about motivation.  Most people could quit smoking if they were offered $12 Million Dollars to quit smoking.  You have to be truly committed to change your life, then do it.  ""I finally became pregnant which was the final push I needed to quit.  I've had ""one or two"" in the following years, but that was usually do to being out in a bar or club.  Other than that I've remained smoke free for almost five years. "Acupuncture and working out. Strange but worked. "I've never smoked, but it sounds like you have a case to get break times for everyone due to some kind of discrimination.  If smokers get time off to smoke, then non-smokers should get time off to do non-smoker things.

This could help you to quit by fixing a shitty policy in your workplace.""Find a reason. I don't just mean a ""Well, I'll get the cancer!"" reason, I mean an actual reason. My grandpa is currently slowly wasting away due to emphysema, and a recent scan revealed multiple cancerous tumors in his lungs. He smoked for sixty years and he'll die as a result. However, he quit ten years ago when he learned that his smoking would have a dire effect on the survival of my granny, as she had a heart condition that his second hand smoke could have an impact on. He threw away his remaining cigarettes and has not smoked since. 

He quit cold turkey and that's a testament to his willpower and I don't expect anyone else to do that. However a reason, an important, personal reason to quit is the best way to go about it. You find that reason, then you get help."[deleted]"Plus 1 on this. It can solve so much more than smoking problems. One dose is all you need. Lsd and mushrooms can help, but there's nothing like a good blast off to help you kick it.""ITT: Badasses who quit cold turkey and don't remember how fucking hard it actually is for most of us.

OP were you looking for methods or motivations?""Former infantryman in the army where almost everyone dips or smokes.
I smoked or dipped for over 20 years, had no desire to quit.

got the flu real bad for a week and after I realized I didnt have a dip, so I kept it going.... after 6 months I only think about it when I see others but not to the point where I wanted to start again.""The patch! I smoked so long for (one of) the same reason(s)- im in retail management and cant get a break unless I'd go outside to smoke. I got 2 weeks of patches free, so when my car broke down and I had to use my dads car (non smoker), plus it had gotten so cold out, I decided to give the patch a shot and im so glad I did!

I dont get a smoke break but I also dont feel like I need it anymore (99% of the time). ""I smoked for 11 years and had trouble quitting as well.  I had a physician once tell me that your body misses the adrenaline more than it misses the nicotine.  Smoking reduces your oxygen intake and you body responds by pumping your heart harder, etc which leads to adrenaline being released I your system.  This made sense to me and explained why I wanted to smoke in the morning and after meals, to perk you up.

Replacing smoking urges with push ups, sit-ups, mild exercise like walking up a bunch of stairs can provide that elevated heart rate that your body desires.

I also had to be mentally ready to quit.  I decided 3 months in advance that I would quit June 25th (or something like that).  Because I knew I was quitting I started getting disgusted with myself ever time I wanted a cigarette.

I've been smoke free since June 2007, no relapses.  I do smoke the occasional cigar but we are only human right.  

Best of luck. ""Found out I was pregnant and quit that day. I don't care if it hurts me, but I'll be damned if I hurt my child.""Two things: 

1. Barely being able to breathe while trying to walk home after too many cigs/too much tequila one hot summer night in NYC.
2. My GF promised me anal if I quit completely (including ecigs).

Which one you think motivated me more?""I took a very unorthodox approach to quitting.  It's worked twice now.  Once for 8 years and a second for three months and counting.  4mg  nicorete, replacing a cigarette a day.  The first one to go for me was the first morning smoke of the day.  It got me in the right mindset for the rest of the day.  Slowly over time I just stopped smoking.  Then I moved Dow. To the 2mg pieces and started trading those for regular gum.  After a few weeks, I was only chewing regular gum.  It's a long process but it worked wonders for me""I quit cold turkey after 20 years of smoking.  Once you have the will, it's just a matter of getting over a 2 week hump.  First remember the mornings you would wake up after a heavy night of smoking and drinking and how godawful your lungs would feel...keep that memory on tap and never forget it, visualize and feel it so you know why you are quitting.  If you have an urge, smoke a fake invisible cigarette like a mime and remember that pain...sounds stupid but it works.  Also Contrary to popular belief I found cigars to help as well, just don't inhale them...that and I bought 3 bags of oranges and just ate an orange everytime I had the urge for a smoke.  Good luck!""I quit September 2012 following a heart scare (I'm now treated for Angina, which at the time I thought was a heart attack.)  I quit after 16 years and 10 attempts, using a nicotine mouth spray.  This is nicotine in an alcohol solution which you spray into your mouth.  It passes very quickly to where it's needed, by going through the mucous membranes, so it knocks the craving out real quick. Worth a shot if it's available where you are.""I used the horrid tasting nicorette gum, but just for the first few days. And only when I was feeling really weak and wanted a cigarette. After the first few days, my body felt better and it was easier."The fact that they gave off the same smell as my ex's bloody cunt...My mentor quit by realizing the cigarettes were in control of his life and that he wasn't the one choosing when or how much to smoke. As a person who always wants to be in charge he said fuck these threw em in a box and stopped cold turkey. "i've started again since, but a few years back i almost successfully stopped by just... stopping. i decided one day ""i do not smoke any more"" and just didn't for months. it was hard for a couple of weeks and then i just didn't even want to any more.

edit: ecigs are great too, they never helped me stop but when you get used to them they're much nicer and healthier to smoke""I went cold turkey, but as you would expect, it's pretty tough. What helped however was finding a different ritual to replace smoking. Instead of taking a break to have a cigarette, I would get an iced tea or a piece of gum. If being at work is your trigger, then replace whatever work smoking schedule you have with something else. Good luck!"Allen carr's easy way to stop smoking. It's a book. Buy it read it never smoke again. "I smoked for about 5 years, quit 6 months after I turned 21. 

Just keep cutting back. Wait a while before having that first one of the day. If you're a pack a day, go down to 15 a day for a few days. Limit yourself one pack every two days after a while.

Resisting the urge is stressful and breaking an addictive habit isn't easy. 

You KNOW you want to quit, stay focused on that whenever you're smoking and keep cutting back. 

Eventually you'll be down to 3-4 a day, and you'll know its time to stop. This is the hard part. The first 3 months can be tough, but after 6 months it won't even phase you to see friends smoking. You'll just wonder why they do it. 

""I'm almost 10 yrs tobacco free after smoking for 9. Aside from The Patch, one thing that really helped with cravings was apples.  Eating one after  meals or during breaks have me the hand to mouth pacification and it cleaned my mouth making me not want to smoke. ""I had gotten into a bad motorcycle accident. Had been laying in the ER for 6 hours in pain and intensely craving a cigarette. They finally administered IV pain medication for me, dilaudid. As soon as that stuff hit me, even the thought of cigarette smoke almost made me throw up. That effect never left me, and I haven't smoked since. That was 3 years ago.""Just stopped. I didn't have to stop smoking, just not smoke that next one and repeat for the next one. 

Changing your environment helps too. Move to a new town, stop smoking. Hang out with a new group of friends, don't smoke around them. Change jobs, don't smoke. 

""The woman I love. She wouldn't date a smoker because her father had lung cancer, so I took a break in order to get a date with her. 3 years later we were married and I haven't had a cigarette since, quit cold turkey with love as my motivation. "I really don't smoke cigarettes when I'm alone however I do smoke when I drive or drink alcohol. Is there anything I can do to reduce the urge?"26 y/o Ex-smoker of 2 years here. I tried everything for years and the only thing that worked for me was this. You actually have to WANT to quit smoking. It's not a matter of whether or not you quit cold turkey or switch to the gum or patches or whatever. If you don't actually want to quit, you won't. This means you quit smoking everything, weed, e cigs, hookah EVERYTHING! Personally I used the gum for a month, then just always had regular gum and sunflower seeds with me at all times. The hardest thing to break out of smoking is the habit. Smoke when you drive, in between classes or breaks from work, in the morning or right before bed, all these things feel so empty once you quit like you have lost a part of yourself. That feeling never really goes away, but you'll live with it. Smoking a like a nasty ex girlfriend, you'll never forget her, but you certainly don't want to start seeing her again.""I've quit twice.  Both times for a girl.  That's apparantly the only way I can quit.  First time she broke up with me a week later.  This time I'm smoke free for 2+ years and going strong.  I don't even think about cigarettes unless I'm in total party mode.  Oh and also, I quit cold turkey."Chronic bronchitis and taking MTB serious"I don't know if this is the greatest method ever, but I quit with a combination of Blu electronic cigs and cold turkey. I haven't smoked in over 5 years now. 

I really think the major reason I quit was because I was so done with cigarettes. I ordered this electronic cig thing online, hell I think it was an ad off of isohunt or something. I ordered the kit and enough cartridges to equal a carton I think. Either route, I loved the addictive vapor. I loved it a lot. I didn't like that either, I didn't want to replace one habit with another. So I made a mental decision halfway through the cartridges to not order any more, no matter how bad I suffered or wanted them. It worked. 

I still smoke weed, but I don't see that as nearly as bad a habit. :D"Not smoking."Commitment to quitting is huge. Break that commitment once and you don't have much justification to do it again.

Back in November I got my Kanger Evod ecig kit in the mail and haven't turned back. The big thing is finding a local somebody to let you try their products before buying what you think you might be in to online. I have months worth of juices that I'll never use because i bought them and didn't like them.""My wife started on Wellbutrin (aka bupropion) for depression, and an unexpected side effect was the sudden and complete absence of any urge to smoke. She had been close to a pack a day for the past 5 years, and now, 3-4 months later, the pack she had the day she started taking the pills is still sitting unopened on the table.

It's actually pretty common for it to be prescribed off-label just as a smoking cessation aid (and apparently also as an aphrodisiac?), so I would definitely suggest bringing it up with a doctor!""I herniated 2 discs in my back that rendered me bed-ridden for 6 weeks. As I didn't have anyone who could reliably bring me cigarettes at the time, I had no choice but to stop. Once I was able to walk again, the desire to smoke completely evaporated. The morphine also helped. A lot."Just stop smoking. 100% will work"I just told myself I could masturbate as much as I want, eat whatever I want, and I went running every day. Also I stayed away from alcohol, because holy shit is a drunk cigarette good. Whenever I got an urge for a cig, I'd either pound down whatever junk food was in sight or tug another one out. No matter how much I love smoking, I love doritos and porn more. It's worked twice for me, and I haven't been a smoker for 4 years after quitting the 2nd time.""I bought black & milds. Every time I would get a craving I would smoke a black & mild, inhaling and all. It made me so nauseous eventually I began to associate smoking with nausea and eventually quit completely. ""I decided to stop smoking. And I stopped. Cold turkey.

It's not that hard, girls. Get some willpower.

/baskInDownvotes""E-cigarettes. And not the cheap 7-11 style. Those are crap and most people won't be successful using those. Also, most people choose tobacco style flavors at first and they taste like crap. Choose a flavor you GENUINELY like! Then, step down the nicotine content until you get to zero. Then, keep some zero around for those moments when you feel like you want to puff on something. It works.""After being a smoker for 20 years my father asked me to quit for his 60th birthday present May 31st last year. Started out with a Blu. After a week my brother gave me a V2 starter kit. After about 2 weeks I was at a bar and bummed a smoke from a friend and about gagged. I was done. I spent $65 bucks on a Halo Triton kit and got my wife to quit too (went with the Triton over an ego or something similar because I still had a lot of leftover V2 carts and they match up with the 808 threads). Started ordering juice from places like Pinkspot and then our town got a vape shop recently s I can drive 2 minutes from work and get good juice without waiting for snail mail. Stepped down my nicotine level gradually and currently use a 6 and my wife is completely off nicotine altogether. 

Tl;Dr Started with small e-cig, graduated to big e-cig, stepped down nicotine level gradually, had a quitting partner. 

""Exercise. I started doing a lot of yoga and running. I guess I realized that if I wanted to go one step further in my athletic abilities, I had to stop smoking. This way, too, I skipped the ""denial"" part. I never said, ""no, issybo415, you can't have that cigarette."" Instead I thought ""if you have that cigarette, you're going to feel like shit tomorrow, and then you won't be able to go running."" I don't know how helpful this will be to most of y'all, but it helped me. ""I smoked for 20+ years and have been nicotine free for over three years.  Like most smokers I planned to quit ""someday"".  That time came for me when I went to a group hypnosist session and saw all these people, young and old, some dragging oxygen tanks and I thought ""there goes me if this doesn't work"".  And it did not work.  I started researching in earnest looking for a 30 day rehab program or anything that help me.  There was very little out there.  I found www.whyquit.com and it was the only really decent resource I could fine.  The fist thing I learned is that there is no such thing as ""weaning"" off of nicotine.  Like any other drug you are either using or you are not.  Cold turkey is the only way to quit.  (just like no such thing as a little pregnant).  While I was still smoking I made a list of all the reasons I wanted to quit.  It was extensive.  I carried that list with me and read it 50 times a day.  It was a nail biting, white knuckle, gut wrenching fight, but after 30 days or so I had it licked.  I would repeat every day like the serentiy prayer, ""No more nicotine.  I can't smoke it chew it inhale it drink it snuff it spray it swallow it suck it lick it or patch it.  I am forever more nicotine free"".  And lastly, I think you really do have to accept that there is no such thing as ONE cigarette.  You are either using or not.  Instead of thinking ""Oh I want one!"" I changed it to ""I want  20 a day, I want to spend $60 a week, I want my clothes to stink and I want to increase my odds of a smoking related disease....."" Because there is NO such thing as one.  Smokers are addicts and nicotine is a fierce friend who will always be there for you, until death do you part.  I'm glad I didn't wait until I was diagnosed with a smoking related disease to stop.  That was my biggest fear.  That I would find out it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be and that it was too late to really matter. AND BEWARE of the electronic cigarette that simply makes you a worse addict because you can administer it more often.  Next time you want to smoke at work say to yourself, ""I would rather die of a smoking related disease than ride out this withdrawal fit for five minutes"".  It won't make much sense when you start thinking about it differently.  It can be done.  3 years, 3 months and one week later, I've never been so happy to be nicotine free and could not possibly want a cigarette and that who monkey-on-the-back habit in my life any more!!!""you have to reach a point where you really want to quit. for me it was when the army sent me to Colorado for gunnery. that mile high air was thin as hell and I could not breath, and started to get nose bleeds. thats when a light went off in my head ""these things are fucking killing me"". I got that gum stuff for a bit but I spent more money than I liked on it and I still wanted to smoke. so I had been a month without and tried to smoke one that was not my brand, it was disgusting, I knew at that moment I was done.""gum infection.I was awake for 24 hours with an gum infection that felt like i was being punched in the face every few seconds the pain was horrible. The dentist told me it could never have gotten that bad if my gums weren't hard as a rock due to smoking. quit the next day and after a course of anti biotics never went back. 
so yeah being horribly ill helps alot""What kind of electronic cigarette do you have?

I've smoked for almost 20 years.. Have tried quitting.. a few years ago when the e-cigs first came out I gave them a shot and was sorely disheartened and went right back to smoking..   Recently I was re-introduced to vaping.. I use disposable Ego Ce4 tanks with an Ego Twist 1100 battery.. it lasts all day with substantial use. It took some trial and error to find out what kinds of flavors I liked but I've finally settled on Coffee / Espresso / kalua / Banana Nut bread... Nothing too sweet and nothing tobacco flavored.    

Now the thought of setting something on fire and sucking in hot smoke makes me sick.. and let me tell you.. I used to enjoy smoking... I liked it.. it was relaxing. 

Vaping has made it so easy for me.. ""I'm still struggling to STAY quit. My grandmother always used to say ""quitting is easy, stating wit is the hard part.""

What made me decide to quit was a mixture of a few things. My mom and both of her biological parents all died of lung cancer. You'd think that watching my mother fade away in front of my eyes would be enough to do it for me, but it wasn't.

What finally got to me was when my five year old started saying things like, ""When I start smoking..."" Or asking how old he had to be to start smoking.

My husband and I both use e-cigs now, but I'm thinking about even stopping that because all is done is change his questions from using cigarettes to using e-cigs."Well e-cigs have got me 3 months so far and I'm not even trying.Cold turkey is the only way to goI was really sick and couldn't smoke so I said F it and went cold turkey. It's been almost a year now.Ecigarettes... 2 years smoke free!Worked at a high end restaurant  where we signed a form saying we wouldn't damage our palates with cigarettes coffee or soda which in a traditional kitchen is blasphemy but innocent I got on board with a crew of committed young chefs it was no big deal and the palate improvement in 2/3 months was insane"Well it sucks but what worked is to avoid bars and clubs, espacially drinking alcohol. Also avoiding meeting some friends who smoke too for a while. Exercising more also helped because you have a goal to achieve so it makes it less appealing to smoke (not to forget that smoking after cardio burns your lungs so bad). ""I just sat on my porch one day and said to myself ""this will be my last cigarette."" This was November 2012. It was my last cigarette. I still get cravings but I would not trade my quality of life now for cigarette. You have no idea how shitty your health is until you quit. Now, I'm training for my 2nd half marathon since and I participate in crossfit 3 times a week. That shit couldn't have happened while I was a smoker."Quit cold and eat a bunch of jolly ranchers. "I quit 1 month before my first child was born. I did it by removing the tempation from my everyday life simply by not bying any more cigarettes..

Even though I for 1,5 days could feel the physical addiction and for several months still wanted to smoke everyday I still was able to avoid it, a feat I wouldnt have been ablo to do if there had been any cigarettes in my house...""For me it was cold turkey. Also, ex-gf cheated on me and I wanted to change my life around. I moved out that night, quit smoking, quit pot, quit my job and enrolled in college for programming.

It will be 10 years this April 1st. I have an awesome job and I've never felt better. My ex cheating on me gave me the will to want to succeed. Best thing that ever happened to me.

When I quit cold, I used to chew straws whenever I felt the urge. That helped. I used to say I go through a pack and a half of straws a day.

The first week is the hardest. Stay strong. Then after 2 weeks you are fine. Just watch out for drinking and social situations that were a habit for you (for me it was halo load screens.. That was always time to quickly a roll smoke lol)."Online support group"What kind of ecig do you have? Getting one that satisfies your core taste and then THROWING AWAY ALL ANALOGS is key. The ""mainstream"" ecigs are often very poor in flavor and vapor production, so I'd recommend you consider getting something quality and finding a juice you actually enjoy. ""I found the njoy e-cig to be a great substitute.  Feel right, taste similar, good ""feel"" to the hit.  Unfortunately they are very expensive compared to a pack of cigarettes here.  The e-cig would last about a day and cost $8, while a pack costs $4.50 and last 2-3 days.  I still pick one up now and again for times when I don't want to smoke(long car trips with the kids, overnights at the in laws etc). 

I have tried a few of the vaporizers that my friend uses, and just can't get the right feel.  Also in his case i think it has made the addiction worse, as he sits and hits those nearly non stop all day.  This might be a reason the njoy does not last for me as well.  Cigs are smoked outside only, and I only smoke one every 3-4 hours normally.  The njoy I could hit inside and would take a hit or two every hour or so.""My wife quit after 15 years of smoking.
Her secret? She died when her car burst into flames on the interstate after a head on collision with a Semi.""I had tried everything a couple times, nothing ever worked for me so I quit on quitting... about a year later I woke up one morning and I just didn't want to smoke anymore, its been over a year and a half since my last one. ""I never smoked a lot, perhaps a pack a week, but one day I decided to quit. I'm sure you know all the good reasons why, but this was shortly before ciggies went up to 11$ per pack in N.Y. I started weaning myself off. The daily cigarette I smoked on the way to the subway became half a cigarette and I'd save the stub to smoke later. It was gross. I reeked so much more and I knew it. That fed back as motivation to quit. Soon I started throwing those stubs out. If I had a strong craving, I'd light up for one puff and throw the cigarette away. This was more mental than anything and I'd give into the craving just too remind myself, in a kind of negative reinforcement, that the taste wasn't enjoyable and the tug didn't solve anything.

I also have to emphasize that I did it with my SO. When I started getting my taste and smell senses back, I could taste it on their lips when we kissed. It became so unattractive to each other, that we would refuse to kiss the other if they had smoked. Having a buddy to quit with is definitely something I'd recommend."Will power."Chantix was a miracle drug for me it worked so good.

I smoked a carton a week or more for 25 years and quit on my first try using Chantix.""I quit going cold turkey, I feel that e-cigs would just keep me addicted.

Try reading this document: http://whyquit.com/joel/ntap.pdf it helped for me.

I think the biggest inspiration for me to quit smoking was when i started to lose my ability to breath. That is terrifying and helped give me a kick up the arse to do what I needed to do. 

I suffered and suffered with my quit, it was total war for at least 6 months but I stuck with it and it gets easier and easier.

Good luck""I would highly recommend decreasing the amount of smoking you do gradually over time until quitting only involves not having one or two cigarettes in a day. Much easier. I'm still sometimes having one in the evening while watching a close basketball game or having a beer, but its more like a rare recreational activity as opposed to something I have to have every two hours like before. "Nicotine gum and a tub of red vines."First of all, I empathize 100% with your frustration/dejection. I quit a dozen times, each time I started again I was hugely depressed that I couldn't beat it.

Second of all, I wish I had a suggestion/recommendation, but I don't. It simply got to the point where mentally/at my core I was so fucking frustrated at myself for being owned by something that I was simply done with them. Stopped mid-smoke, gave the rest of the pack to a friend, and that was that. Seven months later, I've yet to have a craving or really miss them.

I guess, whatever cessation tool you end up using, the key thing is (for me, anyway) to truly be finished with them at your core. If it takes frustration at being owned by something, that works. I think having some sort of fundamental change is key, though. The abstract ""health/money savings"" stuff can always be rationalized away by an addict so those never really stick for me.

Good luck. Seriously!"You just need to want to quit. Products like patches are just a waist in my opinion. Willpower beats all other methods if you can simply control yourself you will prevail."Having kids will do it pretty quick, as will testing for a life insurance policy.  What kind of e-cig do you have?  If you are using the pre-packaged variety, might I suggest switching to the refillable clearomizer variety?""I quit in 2009 cold turkey after getting a cold. At that point my throat was irritated so smoking was only aggravating it. I went a couple of days without smoking and then decided to see how many more days I can go. That was 5 years ago. Also in 2009, I started dedicating a lot of time to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, MMA, and overall health and fitness, so my priorities shifted a lot. I couldn't imagine smoking at this point and coughing up a lung on a training partner during sparring. 

I recommend cold turkey and getting involved in something that requires you to use your cardio and athleticism. It's about shifting your necessities. Initially it was difficult for me during work breaks not to light up as well, so instead of smoking I used to go for a quick 15 minute walk around the work campus. Good luck!""kinky filthy sex. If I quit, I got that, weekly. in perpetuity.  "I had a heart attack last year and that helped me stop smoking quite a bit. The week in the hospital didn't hurt either. And there was a woman who brought patients a leaflet on how to quit and some nicotine gum. I quit over night and that was it.I read the **Wikipedia** article about smoking and immediately stopped the same day. There was also a picture of a tissue with a brown stain on it. The brown stain was from blowing smoke through the tissue. "Having an infant son, and reading the studies about ""third hand smoke.""

Without blowing smoke up your ass, third hand smoke basically just means that the smoky smell your clothes get is because there's a toxic cigarette residue all over you. It's the same reason that ceiling tiles that haven't been replaced since smoking was banned in most workplaces have that yellow tint to them. Among the things that stick to you are a whole boatload of carcinogens, and the tiny infant/toddler lungs will pull in even those tiny amount of toxins and potentially give them lifelong health problems.

Even knowing that, it was hard. I had to remind myself that my son would associate the smell of toxins, carcinogens, and ash with *me*. I had to shift my brain to think of smoke as *disgusting* instead of *desirable*. Every time I saw a smoker I would have to mentally change my brain from ""man I want one"" to ""ew, that's gross.""

Now, over a year later, my brain is pretty much wired that way. I don't think I could smoke a cigarette without thinking about how awful and foul of a habit it is.

Granted, my problem had less to do with nicotine dependency, and far more to do with actually *enjoying* smoking. The whole ritual of going outside, pulling one out, lighting it up, and relaxing while I burn one down is what I was trying to break."http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbb1jyKP3i1rtx8h3o1_1280.pngMy mother smoked for 20+ years.  One day she actually went to a hypnotist and got hypnotized into not smoking anymore.  It actually worked.  She hasn't smoked since and its been about 15 years since then."I had the same issue, but for me and my friends it really came down to this.  You will only quit when you want to quit and have enough will power to stop yourself.  I tried quitting 8 times and realized, I didn't want to quit.  I took up chew, and that has replaced my smoking.  Its not any safer or better for your body, but hey at least I don't smell.  I wish the best luck man/girl.  I smoked for 7 years, been chewin for 6 years.  If I need a smoke I'll hit my e.cig.""I started going to boot camp with some co-workers to lose some weight. At the time I was a casual smoker (maybe 3 cigs/day) I'm very competitive and we were doing a lot of running. Due to to the smoking (and my asthma) I was doing a lot of coughing and falling behind the pack during our drills and group workouts. So, I quit. I wanted to be able to run better and actually be healthier, so I just stopped. I felt like I was wasting all that money I had put into the boot camp to try and work out while continuing to poison my body with cigarettes. ""Just think of what you're actually doing to your body.

Picture yourself with lung cancer.

I smoked off and on for about 8 years. I was at almost a pack a day when I quit. I just wanted to quit so I did.

I think the problem was for most of those years I didnt actually want to quit. I enjoyed smoking. But once I wanted to, I did.

It's weird because Im sure this will be taken as me being a dick, but I really don't understand why people can't quit.
Ignoring physical affects, quitting is about will power.

If you can't make yourself quit something you want to and know is bad for you, doesn't that make you question your own resilience and willpower in life?

How the hell are you going to make your wildest dreams happen before you die if you can't even stop doing something you don't want to do and know is hurting you?

EDIT: To clarify, I am not a robot. The withdrawal sucked. I was very irritable and physically I felt like shit and of course I had cravings. But if those minor things (I mean my god in the scheme of life how minor is that?) are things you can't overcome, then what are you? And what are you even capable of?""The only thing that is gonna help you quit is will. You have to WANT to quit! But to get through the shitty cravings I read, and read, and read. ""Quit cold turkey with my s/o in aygust 2013.  When the cravings hit I would find something else to do.  If I was at home I would go for a walk or bike ride.  It was a rough month of bad dreams, reasonless anger, and frustration.   Been using ecigs since october.    I use 6 and 12 mg nicotine juices ( down from whatever a pack of camel wides would have been)  I now can breath, smell, and taste again.  Life is good. Better without the camel wides.""When I met my SO. He lost his father to lung and throat cancer from smoking. He never asked me to quit but I just didn't feel right doing it in front of him. Quit cold turkey, chewed a shit load of gum and avoided all my smoking friends/family for some time. 

I guess for me it was finding someone who I knew I wanted to spend my life with and knowing that if I kept smoking some of that time could be cut short. Don't give up! ""I smoked for ten years. At times, it was as much as a pack a day. Other times, it was a casual thing such as when I was drinking or with friends. When I started smoking, I preferred filter-less Lucky Strikes.

In the middle of a pack, in the middle of a carton, even, I decided I didn't want to smoke any more. So I stopped. 

Just make up your mind to do it, and do it. 
Just stop. It's not that hard. ""I quit smoking back in mid 2007 cold turkey. I used to give myself such terrible panic attacks every time I lit up that I just quit. Fast forward to May of 2013, for some dumb reason I picked them up again. I keep saying I am going to quit. This past Monday I ""quit"" and ended up buying a pack on Tuesday after work and another one today. I know I need to quit. I have been following /r/stopsmoking for a while now, but clearly I was not ready to really read that sub. Glossing over every post as I browse the front page. I am going to listen to the Allen Carr audio book I keep hearing about. I'll listen on my way home from work today. ""I quit seven years ago. My only advice when asked this question by people is that you have to really want to quit for yourself. Not because of your wife, kids, family, etc. At the end I was down to two cigarettes a day, usually with only a drag or two before I became disgusted and put them out. After about 7 days the physical cravings subside and it's all mental from there. Now even the smell of cigarettes disgusts me.""It's psychological.  Deal with your anxieties, you'll not want to smoke any more.""The day I met the woman I eventually married, I knew immediately that I wanted to be with her, so I struck up a conversation and eventually she told me that she doesn't date smokers. I haven't smoked since. We dated for a year and half and have been married for four years. ""Watching my father die painfully from lung cancer put things in perspective.  Dec 9, 2012 was my last cigarette.""The thing thought first got me to stop was being self aware... I would smoke a full pack in under 4 hours. One night I stopped in the middle of the road and looked at it. I was only half easy thru my last cigarette of the carton. I threw it out the window. I went an entire month before I got another pack (which I killed in one night). Then I got the ecig I haven't smoked a full pack in over 2 1/2 months. And I feel fantastic. 
The goal is to stop buying them. ""Started when I was 14. Quit when I was 43. Tried gum, hypnosis, stupid little electronic device and the patch about 6 different times. Keep trying. The patch finally did it for me. I used name brand not the knock offs. ALWAYS keep one on. Eat, sleep, shower, breath those sticky little things. I gained about 50 lbs. But now I am 90 lbs. lighter and running 5 miles a day. I could never do that before. Good luck.
""2 things helped me quit cold turkey.

1. Altoids. Provided a hand to mouth motion that helped on some psychological level...people had recommended carrots for this, but the minty taste helped my mouth taste clean so that I didn't want to dirty it with the taste of a cig.

2. A large glass of water next to me at all times. Everytime I had a serious craving, I would chug the entire glass, then go refill it. I don't know why this helped, but it really helped a lot. It did suck after eating a bunch of altoids though since I got the peppermint water combo burn.

Thats all I used. My wife has tried patches, gum, e-cig, etc. but none of it breaks the nicotine addiction, just sustains it until you start smoking again, or replaces one nico addiction with another.""I pictured trying to breathe with a 400 lb man sitting on my chest. Every time I started to almost give in to the urge, I pictured black, ugly, diseased lungs. ""Also--don't be mad at yourself for failed quitting attempts.  There are no failed attempts--it's all part of the same process.  You try something, it doesn't work, you try something else, that's called progress, not failure.  Just keep at it--eventually, something will stick and you will prosper from your diligence.  ""My roommate used sunflower seeds as his crutch to get him over the hump.  Incredible amounts of seeds over about 2 months, but it worked for him.""I used to smoke weed and ciggs. My throat began to hurt, and I was coughing a lot so I figured I had to drop one. Now I just smoke weed.""Go to college, live in an apartment, and get a job making minimum wage. After enough times deciding ""food or cigs?"" the answer becomes clear. Quit cold turkey because you can't afford food and nicotine patches.""I'm currently trying to quit. I was trying vaporizing, but I found myself using it way more than I smoked. So now I'm cutting back on that. Same thing with me, work is a trigger. I get breaks no matter what, but what says you can't go outside and take a few minutes to yourself without smoking. Call it a non smoke break. Walk around the block once and then go back in.  ""I was smoking outside and thinking about my life, when i inhaled wrong and choked. As i was coughing, i looked at my cigarette and thought ""wtf am i doing?"" I threw it in the snow and threw the rest of my pack in the trash. That was it. I was done. ""Set a date to quit, even if it's months away.  Building it up and planning it in my mind made all the difference for me."I had been a smoker and heavy drinker for 10 years then one day when I was smoking I noticed that my left calf would hurt after I had a cigarette. This kept happening. Then the pain was spreading to my toes.I had never paid attention to those Peripheral artery disease (PAD) commercials but now it was scaring the shit out of me because the pain was real. So I basically told myself smoking wasn't worth losing a foot or a leg and quit drinking and smoking cold Turkey the next day because they went together . it's been 3 years and don't get me wrong I miss smoking and drinking alot and it's a struggle when routine and emotions trigger cravings.but it's going to take something life changing or something that scares the crap out of you to make you stop.It takes a strong will to not break down and light up.It is possible to quit cold Turkey "I'm 34 days without cigarettes. The best thing for me has been telling myself that something stupid like cigarettes isn't going to control me or hurt me anymore. It's working great. Good luck, op. ""Not me, but my father.  He quit in 2 stages.  First was when I gave him a 6 month deadline - if he didn't quit, I would start (and I really was going to).  Five months later he cut down dramatically and I conceded.  Took a quadruple bypass 8 months after that to make him fully quit.""Quitting smoking is incredibly difficult. Insanely hard to pull off. I struggled with it for over a decade, trying all kinds of self-motivation and self-regulation techniques. In the end in sorry to say that none of them worked for me. 

What worked was an external motivation. I started dating someone who was so strongly opposed to my smoking that it eventually came down to her vs cigarettes. We're now married with a child and while staying quit has gotten easier over time, there are still moments where the only thing that stops me for smoking is the fear of lying to her and/or getting caught and ruining it all. 

It gets easier though, I promise, you have to rack up the days/months/years and you have to accept that you will ALWAYS want to smoke for the rest of your life. Why did we ever start?

If you don't have an external motivator in your life like I did, I recommend you try a support group. Sounds over the top I know, but you can't undervalue how hard quitting smoking is, especially when cigs are available on every corner at all hours. ""Late to the thread but I figured I'd add to it anyway. I never really smoked, it was always my brother and father. In January 2011 my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer, he was gone by Sept 2011. Up until my dad was diagnosed my brother had been smoking for about 20 years. He had quit a couple times but nothing really stuck. As soon as he saw what cancer was doing to my dad he quit on the spot. I'm hoping he keeps it up, I'd hate to see him go through what my dad did.  ""Motivation to quit for good: My wife becoming pregnant with our first child.

Event that forced me to not smoke for 2 weeks: Tonsillectomy

Nicotine Substitute I used to fight cravings: Nicorette

Time since last cigarette: 1 year and 4 months. :)""Just not smoking anymore, no tricks, no gimmicks.I just would stop myself without any inner dialogue."I ran out of money. Didn't smoke an entire summer when I was unemployed. I had to. I want to donate an egg to a family and you are required to be smoke-free. So I had to stop. I want one quite frequently. You just need to find the right thing to motivate you.I stick the cigarette up me butt and it hurt so no more smoke"My dad quit smoking when he found out that he had a high level of cholesterol in his body and he's getting fat. He quit for about 3 years, but when our family was busy preparing my sister's wedding 1,5 years ago, my mom allow him to smoke again, so he could release the stress.
On the same time, my bf has quit smoking for 5 months. His reason is quite simple, he was afraid if I don't want to kiss him anymore because of the bad breath. But when he saw my dad smoking again, he started smoking, too. A month later, my dad quit smoking for the second time, while my bf still enjoying his cigarette until today.""Keep trying. Every time you fail, you learn a bit more about yourself and your own quitting process. It takes about 7 times on average to figure out what works for you, and what works for you doesn't always work for others. Just try different things each time and pay attention to your thought process and you'll start to figure out why you smoke, what your triggers are, how you think in terms of willpower and smoking and your addiction. Then, armed with all that knowledge, you kick the habit.

Don't listen to people telling you they quit a certain way and what's best for them is best for you as if that's the only method. A ton of people judged me for using nicotine lozenges and not quitting cold turkey. I couldn't do cold turkey. I tried a few times, but my willpower wasn't strong enough or I my physical/psychological addiction was too strong, or something. Anyway, over the course of 15 years, I tried the patch, cold turkey, shoddy hypnotism, herbal remedies (nox vomica, chewing on licorice root), welbutrin, etc. Each time I tried (although I didn't know it at the time) I was learning how to quit. My attempts taught me different things about myself, my triggers, etc.

Develop your own personal system and be willing to change/modify it. I will say, though, that each time I quit, it was slightly traumatic. I would quit, go through the suffering of quitting, and relapse, only to both regret relapsing and avoid quitting again, sometimes for months, sometimes for years. In the end, I tried the lozenge and it was the most successful attempt I had (4 months). Out of all the other tries, that was the most helpful method. It satisfied my psychological/oral addiction in a way that the patch couldn't.

What I learned from that attempt, which was my second to last, is that your brain will lie to you, manipulate you, con you into smoking again. My brain said: oh, its been months since you've had a cig; you can surely have just one. And I did. And I had just one. Then a week later I had two. Then a pack a couple weeks later. I learned that I can never be one of those part-time smokers and that my brain will lie to me to get the nicotine it wants. I don't have the willpower to 'cut down.' It's either all or nothing.

My method with the lozenges was to suck on them all day until I stopped thinking of cigs as my fix. I trained my brain to think of lozenges instead of cigs as my source for the drug. Then, once I was satisfied that I had replaced the mental addiction to cigs, I took the lower dose of nicotine lozenges. Did that a few months more until I felt confident I wouldn't go back to cigs if I stopped the lozenges. Then I stopped the lozenges and relied on willpower. 

I also created negative associations with cigs to fuel my willpower. I told myself I was a ""junkie"" for cigs, and I could never again have just one or I'd relapse, just like someone in AA. It was fucking hard. I remember thinking, 'its been 6 months since my last cig and I still have to fight the urge to smoke, will I have to live like this forever?' The answer was, yes, for another 6 months. Then 6 months after that: no, not too often and in different ways. I'll see people smoking and I don't want the nicotine; I just have a vague memory of smoking, perhaps nostalgia. But that's the extent to which I ever think about smoking again.

I also picked up running as a replacement for the cigs. I think it works because if I smoked, I wouldn't be able to train for marathons. Sometimes I'll be on my run for the day thinking: no way would I trade cigs for this. 

I smoked for 15 years and it took about 7 tries to quit (which I believe is the avg amount of times it takes to quit). Just keep trying. That's the trick. Each time I quit got me closer to actually quitting. 

Good luck, Kimosabe. I feel for you. It's fucking hard to quit. Hardest thing I think I ever did. But you can do it. Just keep trying.""Food poisoning! I ate some bad food that took a few hours to hit me, but even when I showed signs of getting sick I continued to smoke. It took me 4 days to recover, but I didnt stop smoking till the end of the 2nd day. Afterwards, when I was better, the thought of smoking made me sick to my stomach, as did the smell of other people smoking. I never looked back. ""I picked a date 6 weeks in advance and spent the intervening time teaching myself I wasn't going to be an *ex-* smoker, I was going to be a *non-* smoker. None of this ""hey, let's quit smoking on Monday"", I *planned* this shit. I watched all the situations and habits I'd developed around the art of smoking and developed alternatives. I also accepted that I'd be in nicotine withdrawal for 3 or 4 days and that those days would suck.

Which they did.

After a month or so when I was with a friend who was smoking a cigarette, I was *this close* to mooching one to ""prove"" that I had kicked the habit. And I reminded myself that I wasn't an *ex-* smoker, I was a *non-* smoker, and what does a nonsmoker want with a cigarette?

I also gained 30 pounds and a *hell* of a thirst for beer. But fuck it, I was off the smokes.""I used to run. Like a lot. Then my sophmore or junior year of college i started heavily chain smoking to deal with the stresses of my major classes. One day senior year I tried to run again. I felt like I was an 80 year old man trying to run a marathon. and it was a short distance a mile at most...that's when I decided I didn't want to feel like crap while exercising. So I decided to first just attempt to quit for a month. Once I got to 15 days I decided to keep going for as long as I could. Been smoke free for about 4 months but it's something you really have to want. So my suggestion is set a small goal, like don't smoke for a week. See that goal through and then make another small goal like 2 weeks. Eventually you'll get to a point where you are too proud to give up on yourself. Everything in life is about small goals, too often we set large unrealistic goals for ourself. And above all if you have a cigarette don't get mad at yourself, your only human. Just try again the next day""3 things:

Stop buying them. 

Stop thinking of yourself as a smoker.

Don't spend time around people who smoke until you can handle it.

90% of it is breaking the ritual part of it. Smoking is made great by having a reason to ritualistically stop everything you are doing, step outside, clear your head, get a breath of fresh air and let yourself relax for a minute. 

You have to break this ritual, and you do that by not thinking of yourself as a smoker. Find something else to fill that space of time with, and before very long you won't have to, because you'll just stop thinking about it.

Don't buy cigarettes. No seriously. There is no emergency pack, and there is no weening yourself off them. Just stop buying them. I know that sounds impossible but it really isn't. Having to go all the way to the store for a pack is a pretty big deterrent once you stop just carrying a pack on you.

So you quit. Congratulations. Here's the thing, if you live with people who smoke you won't last 2 months. If you're in a: relationship with someone who smokes either you both quit or nobody does. When that urge hits and you don't have any cigarettes, you're gonna start smoking theirs, until you feel bad for mooching off them and buy your own pack, telling yourself you'll quit later.

Quitting isn't hard, staying quit is. There isn't any gimmicky technique to help you get through that, you just have to want to be a nonsmoker more than you want a cigarette.""H1N1. I got so sick I couldn't smoke for a long time, so I used that as the last push I needed. "Working in health care and you smoke? That should be enough to quit right there. As for how I quit after 22yrs and 5 attempts I just stopped chewed gum and was always drinking cold water. It worked for me. Quit Cigarettes by switched to smoking only cigars.Nic-O-Dick"Having support from my wife (who was at the time my girlfriend) was the best help for me. If I indulged in one from stress and what-not she wouldn't flip out but would make it well aware she wasn't happy about it.    
Thought of her putting up with it was bad enough for me. ""I woke up one morning and just didn't want to smoke any more. I didn't really feel like it but out of habit I went out on the back deck to have my morning smoke and coffee,* and halfway through I grimaced and looked at my cigarette.  
Bleh.  
I stubbed it out and went inside. I went into the garage. I took my half-full pack and crushed it in my fist and dumped it in the bin. 

I didn't smoke for many years after that. 

Every once and then I'll bum one at a party and it just reminds me why I quit in the first place.

Recently I'd smoke during camping trips. The * above is to indicate that typing that sentence, ""Morning coffee and smoke"" literally made me drool, even today. Luckily, I could buy a pack for the long weekend have a smoke now and again, and then throw it away afterwards and not have a puff until the next year. 

I've quit that too though, as it has just lost all appeal these days. It's almost like I want to be able to enjoy a cigarette when I feel like but I can't. "Smoke more weed"I just quit cold turkey after smoking for about 8 years. I woke up one day and just decided to was time. That was almost 2 years ago, and I have not looked back.""Working out. Once I started being consistent in the gym and began to enjoy it, every time I wanted to smoke I would think ""this is really going to affect my workout later"", so I just wouldn't do it.

Quitting was mindless. "Multiple trips to the hospital and the nurses telling me ""you're doing it to yourself idiot, stop.""""I smoked for 8 years. Today I am 4 months and 1 week clean of cigarettes. I switched to Blue e-cigs it an attempt to cut down and try to get my nicotine fix without ruining my lungs. The e-cigs lasted about 2 months and 2-3 weeks before I lost my atomizer for the e-cig. Thought it was a matter of time before I broke down and bought a pack but thankfully I was able to stick it out and here I am. Never thought I could do it. I am also a weed smoker, that helped a lot.""I read a book called ""Allen Carr's EasyWay to Quit Smoking"" and quit cold turkey. I've referred it to a few of my friends and they all stopped smoking too. Best part is that you can read it free online.

It's a really easy and fun read - and it's short. I know it sounds weird, but the book actually makes you ENJOY your cigarette cravings.

First I don't get why at a health care job you'd only get a break to smoke.  For me I just felt much better after a week of no smokes.  Then I'd go out and smoke and the next few days find that my air intake was less.  I can breath much better after a week of no smoking.  Breathing and being able to reach my cardio exercise goals is what did it. I hear you always get a very minor craving decades after quitting but it's so minor it goes away within a minute.  And my clothes, hair, and breath don't smell like shit all the time.  IMO, cigs are immature and a thing a lot of people successfully quit in their late 20's early 30's."Heart Attack.  Im 41.  Worked like a charm....."Ok I have two things to say about how I quit. ( smoked a pack a day for 15 years since age of 15. 32 now and have been nicotine free for over two years.). 
First, as others say, pick a day and commit to it. But here is what helped me most. That last cigarette needs to be a very sacred ritual for you. Find a beautiful place, comfortable and serene and quiet. You are about to smoke your last cigarette. Take it and smell the cig. Feel it in your fingers and stare at it like you it's the last thing you are allowed to see. 
Then smoke it. Really smoke it and concentrate on the smoke enveloping you, let it fill your entire essence. Let all the sensations of joy you ever felt bubble up as you enjoy your smoke. Breathe deeply the smoke, me it fill you lungs and carry the nicotine to your brain. Try to imagine the smoke traveling through you and the smell and and vision envelope you. You are becoming one with the smoke. Be still and think about the smoke, every aspect. Committ it to your deepest most secure memory. This is the foundation of dis tilling your smoking experience. When you finish, slowly put it out and envision a friend departing for a long voyage, one in which they may never return. Inhale the last fumes from the remaining embers as if it were the last oxygen in the universe. 

Now. 

Get. Angry. 

Your anger can fuel you through the first 48 hours of withdrawal. You make past this and the worst is over. Go run, sleep, seclude yourself. Whatever. Just make it 48 hours and your withdrawal will begin to lessen.
The hours will get easier.  The days will get easier. The weeks the months will get easier. 

Your addiction can be conquered but it will take its toll on you. 

Get angry that it took you this long to toughen up to the challenge. 
""Vaping. Plain and simple. My friends who vaped for a while, but for some reason or another stopped, eventually started vaping again because they truly felt the difference. It will help you."Actual technique: Let yourself have every other cigarette that you crave.  You will crave them but let the craving pass and tell yourself that you can have the next one.  Not this one.  Then do have a cig and be content with yourself.  You can overcome the craving and break the social habit.  You establish control over your craving.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had a child on the way and was being hounded by my family to consider the future and think about him I probably would have kept smoking. If it wasn't for e-cigarettes I would not have been able to quit. An ecig"Not enough money was the motivation. Had support from NHS quitline, nicotine lozenges, but nowadays the E.cigs would be the way to go, just step the dose down gradually every week.""Cold turkey it for two weeks. Then use an e-cig when you can't handle it anymore.
But, you gotta be cold turkey stopped for at least two weeks for this to work hon!""I decided to stop.

It's unhealthy and makes things around you smell bad""A co-worker motivated me to quit. I picked a random day. Two months in advance to give myself plenty of time to prepare. The night before my quit day I had my last cigarette at 8:30pm. The next morning was not as bad as I thought it would be because I kept psyching myself up for the big day. I haven't smoked in a year and 2 months. I almost had a smoke when my uncle passed away but was lucky no one let me. Make sure you surround yourself with supporters. People who will help you. You know the saying, misery loves company. All your smoking friends will probably be jealous of your success and try to sabotage it by helping you out with your cravings. ""I smoked a pack a day for 10 years and finally decided that I did not want to die of cancer, my grandfather died of lung cancer, my dad is following suite and I was as well, so I got some patches, and would wear them 24/7 the strongest ones. I enjoyed them because they gave me vivid dreams when I wore them in my sleep. I would wake up in the morning feeling like I just watched a 6 hour movie. I would put a new patch on before bed each night just for the dreams. It took two boxes of the strong ones and I wore the last patch until it fell off, (about three days). The thought of my wife having to watch me die of cancer is overall what did it for me. I would not be able to call myself a man if I knowingly put my wife through something like that.  "Allen Carr's Easy way to quit smoking. the small addition not the huge book. worked myself and my mother"smoker of 5 years, cold turkey worked for me. when you decide that you *really* want to quit it will be as easy as clicking your fingers. a good way to think of it is when you decide the day has come for you to quit, you are as of that day a **non**smoker. nonsmokers dont smoke, so the idea of you picking up a cigarette and smoking it is absurd, why would you? you are a nonsmoker..""Homelessness.

I don't, you know, really *recommend* it as a method to quit smoking but that's what did it for me.  Let's see... I've been able to scrape together three bucks, I *could* spend it on food or I could buy a pack of Winstons.    Decisions, deci.. right, food it is. "Try vape mods. They worked for me and are a little stronger then e-cigarettes I think "The ecig community is thriving right now. I'm not sure about your setup with your ecig, but I recommend looking into a bigger and better setup. You can get a really great setup for under 50 bucks. I just picked mine up one day and never thought about cigarettes again. Especially with people always asking me where I got it and how it works; instinctively becoming a hobby. Look into r/ecigs and talk to some people about it. Another redditor hooked me up with my first setup.
"I used the patches. For me it helped to get rid of the habit of constantly lighting up first. Then I just slowly weened off the nicotine. Haven't smoked in four years."Determination. I was a heavy smoker for about 14 years and haven't had a cigarette since New Year's eve. The first week was definitely the toughest. If you can hold out for that first week, it does get easier. I still have occasional cravings, but far fewer than the first week. "Wellbutrin. But it did a number on my head. And after two years I relapsed and started smoking again. Brazilian Ju Jitsu (BJJ)- I  had no choice but to quit once I started training. I was smoking since I was 14 I quit this last year at the age of 22.  What I found was I knew smoking was bad for me but I never really felt troubled by it. I tried to stop multiple times but I 'relapsed'. When I started training within a month I quit. Haven't smoked since. The reason why it forces you to quit is that BJJ is a performance sport you need to be fit and healthy to fight. And we fight every session.  I kept getting choked out and tapped because A) I was new B) I had no stamina. I felt like a knife in my chest after sparring for a few mins. It forced me to quit because I wanted to perform better and did not want to get beaten up as much. In other words I felt in danger. OP if you want to quit my unmedical advice is train BJJ and you will understand what I mean and you will probably quit."Chantix. I used it for 2 weeks only and it made me hate cigs.. I also really, REALLY, wanted to quit. These two things combined has made me cig free for 3 years now :)

Good luck on quitting "I had several failed ecig attempts until the good people over on /r/electronic_cigarette helped me find the right equipment for me. "Using nicotine patches did it for me.. But not on your arm!  Stick it on your buttock.  It'll stay on better, and give a way more even delivery of the substance.  ""Cold turkey.  Will power was the only thing that worked for me.   Everything else was an excuse to fail. At least in my experience with patches or substitutes. I work in the medical field and it truly is a terrible way to die. 
Managing what you do with your break time is the biggest challenge.  Do anything but smoke....if you start to slip, think of the reasons you need to quit.  Failure is not an option. Starting over is worse than pushing through.  
One more thing, you will never regret quitting. It will bring  a source of pride and accomplishment. It is worth it. And when you finally get to the other side you'll wonder why you hadn't sooner.""E-cigarettes.

Specifically, an iTaste MVP2 with a kanger protank3 and juice from vapor chef. Battery lasts for days, nary a dry hit, and no obnoxious light-up cigalike tip. I smoked both e- and regulars for about a year before finally pulling the plug on the analogs a month ago.

This is the longest I've been without smoking cigarettes in over seven years.""Not me, but we only got my mother to quit after I had been diagnosed with cancer, really drove home that she should stop pushing her luck.

Then we found out it was something else, she stayed off them but I picked them up..."Running"A good reason. My grandfather who smoked for 50 years ( he was born in the time and area where smoking was not so negatively looked upon at the time, not to mention him being the only surviving member of his family after the war in Korea. ) and as soon as my cousin or his grandson was born, he quit cold turkey for the sake of my cousin. The reason being that my cousin lived with the grandparents. "Bronchitis. That shit is painful. Woke up one morning and decided to not go and buy a pack of smokes Willpower. I quit cold turkey around 6-7 years ago. I didn't really write down a date or anything... I just did it."I just got tired of it.  Of course I was the kind of smoker who could smoke 30 a day or go days without any.  It was really a habit not an addiction.

Take it one day at a time...one cigarette at a time.  Don't focus on quitting forever.  Just decide not to smoke THIS cigarette.   ""1. Don't decide to try to quit. Decide that you have already quit.
2. Or, don't decide to quit smoking (which is hard), instead decide to quit buying/bumming cigarettes (which is one step removed). If you never have a cigarette in your possession, you cannot smoke it.
3. If being around certain people or in certain settings seems to make you cheat, don't be around them (at least not for a while).
4. Have alternatives to smoking in place. Buy some candy (you can lose the weight later). Find some other activities to fill the time you would usually smoke. Replace a destructive addiction (smoking) with a constructive one (exercise, reading) or at least a neutral one (playing video games).
5. Remember, you only have to survive the first two weeks to have made it 80% of the way to success.""Smoked from age 14 to 30. (at the time) All of my friends smoked, the coworkers I associated with smoked and socializing usually ment smoking was okay too.

So what helped me quit? After the 3rd time of really trying and not just a ""maybe I'll have just one instead of two on my break"", I saw a doctor and got a prescription for an inhaler that looked like a tampon.

This helped in two ways. First the stupid thing looked like a tampon. Who in their right mind would be in public with one of those things next to their mouth? My hand would be the last to raise. It was humiliating which was helpful because I chose my times to use it carefully. 

The second way is the nicotine. I think I had the 3 mg nicotine (I could be wrong, it was a while ago) inhaler which was *very* strong. Just a few drags and I was high as a kite. It also burned the sh!t out of my throat so it gave me the same sensation of a real smoke.

I told all of my friends I quit smoking too, this is very important. Not that I was trying to quit...nooo...I quit. This is more a testament to your own will power than anything. You really, really, really have to want it. Don't half ass this. As someone famous once said, ""Smoking is just a classy way of committing suicide.""

As someone in the medical field you need to take a stand and set the example. You can do it!"Willpower."I quit a pack+ a day habit almost three years ago. I used Chantix for a month and determination. Don't bother with e-cigs, patches, or chewing tobacco. They will just be another vice you have to quit down the road. Commit and suffer through. If you slip up immediately quit again. ""I used an electronic cigarette i bought online. Those cigarette ones you get at the gas station do not cut it. I cost me around $80 to get that and the nicotine juice. I didnt have to buy any more juice for at least a month. It pays for itself in a week or so depending on how much you smoke. 

I now dont even smoke the ecig anymore, except sometimes when I'm drinking. I convinced 4 of my friends who were heavy smokers to get one and now they all only smoke ecigs. They even smoked more than I did. I haven't had a cig in over a year. Fuckn win. ""It took me at least 5 attempts over the course of a few years to quit. I found the gum helped me tremendously. I did get ""addicted"" to the gum, but was able to completely stop smoking and only use the gum for about 1 year.

Over that year I started exercising again and generally feeling much better, and it was far easier to stop using the gum than stopping cigarettes without help. When I finally quit all nicotine my psychological addiction to cigarettes had been broken, so at that point I had isolated the chemical addiction, which is much easier to get through.""Caught a cold in May of 2009. It was so bad that I couldn't smoke for 2 weeks. On may 29th, 2009, I smoked my first cigarette after the sickness. On June 1st, 2009, I smoked my last.

I got tired of coughing. Coughing from walking. Coughing from laughing. Coughing from breathing. Coughing from coughing.""I'm going to say this like it's easy, but it is in no way as simple as it sounds. I stopped buying cigarettes. I thought to my self this is the easiest first step I can take to quit and it has worked fairly well. I stopped buying cigarettes a little after Thanksgiving and ran out on my last pack around Dec 1. Since then I've had 3 cigarettes that I've bummed from friends. Only one since the new year (on Jan 11). I still have moments when I feel like I really want a cigarette because of stress or being drunk (which is why I had that cigarettes on Jan 11). It takes a lot of will power and determination to keep it up.

The biggest thing (as others have said) is truly wanting to quit. If you're just thinking to yourself ""yeah I should quit,"" you won't. You're just lying to yourself. I've gone through that cycle a few times and realized it. You have to mean it and you have to take steps toward that goal. Not buying cigarettes is a good first step to take. 

Another thing you can do is tell people about you quitting smoking by posting every day on reddit, facebook, myspace (it works better posting on a site where your friends [ones you interact with frequently] will see it and not just internet people you know). Doing that makes you accountable. That way if you do revert to smoking you get that feeling like you've just let down all those people (assuming they're supportive of you quitting) even though you only really let yourself down. It seems to hit you harder when you let other people down than when you let yourself down, at least it does for me.
""Normally, I would probably be puffing a cigarette while typing this, but I wanted to let you know my one and only way to quit.

After 15+ years of smoking, I've tried everything from cold turkey, patches, gum, and even hypnotherapy. The hypnotherapy worked for a while but I was back at it after 1 year.

The only successful way was to find a safer and healthier alternative: Vaping. Many people have controversial debates on the merits of this fairly new way of inhaling nicotine but if you do the reseach you'll find that it's multitudes better than smoking the analog cancer stick.

I've even written an article about it on my friend's blog. Please check it out if you want: http://pirateclass.com/easy-way-quit-smoking/

I hope this helps my friend, and cheers to taking steps toward a healthier lifestyle :)

Good luck,
Jamie""I'm really happy to see that I'm not the only one who thinks cold turkey is the best (and only definitive way) to stop smoking. I preach it to all my friends who still smoke. When I went cold turkey, I lived with two other smokers, so that was pretty hard. But when they went outside to smoke? I went with them but I didn't smoke. Some people try to get themselves away from the temptation but that's most definitely not the best way to go about it. I decided that changing one habit at a time was all I could manage and it turned out for the best. Going on 4 years now without so much as a puff. The secret? Not a one. You have to treat yourself like an alcoholic. Just because you've gone 3 months without one doesn't mean you can now turn into a ""social smoker."" 

You can't go from being an addict to a casual smoker. You just can't.

EDIT: I also kept reminding myself how addiction = weakness. I kept saying, ""Self, you're way stronger than this, so don't be a weak little bitch! Addiction is for pussies!"""Mechanical mod e cigarette with 18mg juice. Came in the mail 3 days ago and have had a cigarette since. "10 year smoker...pack a day the final 5 years...smoke free for 2 years.  I asked my uncle how he quit once and he said, 'You can't have a cigarette ever again.  Once you understand that, you will be able to quit.'  

That is the only advice that worked for me and I tried to quit at least a half dozen times.  I used the patch for a month to get past the physical addiction.  That is the easy part, the hard part is resisting the urge to bum a cigarette and justify to yourself that you have the necessary self-control to have just one.  You don't.""Honestly for me, I quit cold turkey. It's tough, but after years of it I just had to make the change.""Over on r/getmotivated I've seen some people have success with quitting apps. I don't know how well they work and I'm guessing they would suppliment a cold turkey approach but i've seen some cool features like how many cigs not smoked, how long you've been smoke free and how much money you've saved. Keeping track of that stuff would probably help keep you motivated."Personal will"I smoked for 8 years, smoking 2-3 packs a week. It started out in college as something that was viewed as ""being cool"". I would smoke about 1.5 - 2 packs during the weekdays and on the weekend, combined with drinking, I would finish an entire pack. This went on for 8 years before I realized how much it affected my life.

I tried to go running one day and I just ended up hacking out mucus half-way through the run. I tried to quit. I failed. I bought the gum, I failed even worse. I would chew gum during the day and then smoke at night. I tried to limit the # of cigarettes a day. I told myself if I only smoke 5-6 a day, it's not so bad. I'd smoke 1 before work, 1 during lunch, 1 after work and 2-3 before bed. Come the weekend, it was a full on pack. Nothing seemed to work!

I failed repeatedly. Every time I tried to stop, I would pick at my hangnails and fingers to a point where they would be bleeding. My cravings were all over the place. Then I took a look at my life, my relationships, my friendships... where I was and where I wanted to be. My relationship with my gf was not well. My ""friends"" were really acquaintances and my life was unhappy. I was not well. The environment that I created for myself was what drove me to smoke. And I kept failing because every time I tried to stop, I only stopped smoking and kept the rest of my lifestyle the same.

It was at this realization that I realized that there was no way I could stop smoking and keep the rest of my life the same. It wasn't that I needed to stop smoking, it was that I needed to change my lifestyle.

And I did.

I distanced myself from these people that gave me stress. I distanced myself from people that smoked. I took up running. I started drinking less. I must've failed another 3 times, but every time I did, I wouldn't go back to the previous lifestyle. I kept improving it.

In the end, those things that were driving me to smoke no longer existed and the only battle I was faced with was me vs. the cigarette. I ended up winning. That was 5 years ago! :)

Not only do I not smoke anymore, I also detest the smell of it.

Long story short: Don't just stop smoking, but make a permanent change to your lifestyle! 

"I started forcing myself to run or ride the bike and realized hoe bad my cardio was. The pain disgusted me."wanting to quit is the biggest thing. Removing yourself from the temptation. Change the situation. I worked in a kitchen and it was the same. But I started taking a break to go and sit down elsewhere. Don't get caught in the gilt of having to cover for somebody. I used zyban, and it totally removed my craving for nicotine. Then it was changing my mind from a smoker to a non-smoker""2 to 2.5 packs of Marlboro Reds or unfiltered Lucky Strikes per day.  I just decided to change, and went cold turkey.  I was not terribly pleasant to be around for about 2 or 3 weeks.  

I still have a cigar now and then.""Quit cold turkey. Ditched any friends or family that smoked for 3 months. Did not go out anywhere for three months. Did not drink for three months. Allowed myself to eat like a pig for three months. After those 90 days, the cravings were pretty much gone but I try to moderate my drinking when I am someplace where smoking is likely to avoid the trigger. Been smoke free for three years.""I started dating this girl I was super into and incredibly attracted to. When we began getting more physical, I noticed that it was becoming more difficult for me to get an erection. That, honestly, scared me into quitting. Then a year later, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer (very curable, I am OK now). That scared me into never touching a cigarette again. I was 38 at the time. Been smoke-free for 3+ years. 

Quitting smoking is a lot like prison. If you can make it through the first three days, you are golden. Those first three days suck though. But if you make it that far, just internalize the fact that if you have one, you'll have to keep going through that same hell every time you quit. 

I still miss it. I just know I can't allow myself to do it. It's really mind over matter. Your mind is infinitely more powerful than a drug. "Having a lung cancer scare that ended up being sarcoidosis is what did it for me.WILLPOWER (and nicorette)Copenhagen "48 days without a cig for me. I smoked for 10 years, and attempted quitting several times. A couple weeks before Christmas last year I came down with a cold and didn't feel much like smoking. Haven't touched a cig since. I guess you could call it cold turkey. I did however get a vape pen! I love not smelling like smoke (truck included), and my teeth are noticeably whiter.
"Cancer."I knew I had 3 options:

1. Smoke forever
2. Quit
3. Be someone who is always in the process of quitting.

Option 1 was out, Option 2 was the least desirable of all.

When I quit I would get horrible withdrawal symptoms.

I learned to associate having a cigarette with having to start quitting all over again.  

Turns out, I hated quitting slightly more than I loved smoking.  So it stuck.
""I was actually taking bupropion as an antidepressant and it helped me quit. I took the drug for six months for depression and over that time I completely stopped liking cigarettes. I think it took away the addictive properties. It did take a month or so though since the drug was kind of rewiring my brain. I recommend that drug, since I'm now depression and cigarette free. That was three years ago. "I quit cold turkey one day when I decided I didn't want to smoke anymore. People look at me like I'm either crazy or lying or both when I tell them that though. :Y"First. U have to really want to quit.
Second. The first few days are easy, it's that second week that gets you. Get something to chew on for after you eat, in the car, really whenever you usually smoke. I personally used sunflower seeds. 
I would not have been able to do it without the seeds.""For me, it was the request of a pretty lady.""Cold turkey, just over 3 years ago

It really took a lot to do it though, my wife has asthma so I knew that my smoking was making it harder for her to breath. I also quit while I was changing duty stations (navy) so I moved away from all of my ""smoker"" friends...although while it made things easier it was still not easy.""I feel like a lot of it is just accepting how hard it's going to be. Alternative nicotine sources just prolong the chemical addiction and most people that quit this way relapse. Or, they never get off the alternative source. I decided after 5 years that I just wasn't going to smoke anymore.

I weened myself off of them over the course of about a week until I was down to 2 cigarettes and quit the next day. The thing of it is, if you've smoked for a long time, you have to fight the battle to not start again every day. Especially if you're around them. As an addict, you can NOT be a casual smoker. You can NOT only smoke when you drink. If you make deals like this with yourself you'll fail. Every time.

It's been about 6 months for me. I still think about them pretty frequently. Oddly enough, I'm almost always smoking in my dreams. I usually wake up feeling angry at myself for caving in til I come to :P"Started snorting the cocaine instead of smoking it. "My wife is quitting right now. She is using nicotine gum to calm her cravings. This time I think she was really ready for it. She has failed in the past. For some it takes a few attempts. Just like dieters it may take a few tries before you are successful at controlling cravings. As another poster mentioned the little ones trying to emulate you helps you realize what you are doing to your self. My 7 year old not to long ago told my wife that she cant wait to smoke so they can have smoking chats. That made a huge impression on my wife. she is a few weeks in and is now naturally using less and less gum per day. I'm so proud of her. This time i decided to not to get mad if she failed. I told her that it was okay if she failed at quitting and she could always try again. I think less pressure from me this time around mad a difference too. She also recently started a new semester of school, I though for sure the pressure of school work would make her cave in, but she still going strong. She has some of those calculator apps for her iPad. Reviewing the impacts of her changes on the apps helps her to keep going. She reviews them often. ""You have to want to quit. Stay away from smokers, get rid of all smoking stuff (ashtrays, lighters) and just have some self control. Also STAY AWAY from alcohol completely until you've been quit for at least a month.""I tried quitting 10 times before just waking up one day and saying fuck it. I tried every god damn method, from patches to punishing myself to betting with my grandma. I was smoking 2-3 packs a day at the time. You just have to say fuck it and never look back. It's been 8 years since I quit and I have never smoked a cigarette. A few years ago I started getting into cigars and smoke one every few weeks/months.""A good electronic cig helped me. Not like a shitty NJoy or Blu or some turd like that, but a good one with a larger battery, tank and some juice that actually tastes good. Made all the difference! Once I started steaming off that puppy, I never even wanted a smoke any more. Smoked for over 20 years and tried quitting a million times. Got it now!""I know I'm late and this will be buried but I want to share too! First my 2 year old broke my heart the day she grabbed my cigs pulled one out put it in her mouth and tried to take a drag. 
Secondly work was where I smoked the most but met a guy, the most qmazing guy I've ever known, and I wanted to be able to spend more time (ie: breaks) with him. So one tuesday 2 months ago I just quit. 

One of the hardest things ever but I did it. Now just to woman up enough to tell the guy how I feel.

Tldr: my little girl and an amazing guy made smoking suckso I quit.""I took Chantix.  It gave me awful nightmares, but I said this time I would keep up with the medication until I quit!  I had multiple lucid nightmares, but the worst, by far, was the one where I went to a music festival.  My stomach rumbled and I thought ""man, need to make poop!"" so I head to the porto-john, but Im too late.  I poop my pants.  This dream repeated itself for 8 hours!  It was the worst dream I can remember, and it felt real!  Everything felt like it was really happening.  I would just poop my pants, over and over, and over.  I remember just having the feeling of giving up in the dream.  I couldnt fight the poop.  I woke up sweating, thinking that the entire event was real.  It took me a good 6-7 seconds before my brain would believe that it was a dream.  I quit that day""Numerous attempts. Eventually tried to whole e-cig in place of real cigs... this made me a raging nicotine addict even more than before.Started smoking about a pack and a half for a year then got a bad cough so I decided to give it another shot cold turkey. My main motivation is working around about 3 older guys who have horrible, constant hacking issues...I don't want to be that guy. Goodluck and my only words of advice would be to find your main motivation that outweighs the want to smoke when you get that craving, and to maybe just slow yourself down and hold off as long as you can until it passes.""My dad was a smoker for a long time - since before I was born. It was just something he did every day and it was a key part of my dad growing up.

When I was 8 or 9, he suddenly decided to quit. I'm not sure why or for what, but he tossed out the ashtrays and cartons and started wearing the nicotine patch. And that was that - I never saw him smoking again, he never smelled like it again, and it seemed he would just continue the patch program until it was up and then that would be that. I was obviously quite young at the time, but not young enough to feel like for all the hoopla about quitting being difficult, he seemed to have a really easy time.

About 6 months into that, I was at his office - it was probably Take Your Daughter To Work Day or something - and one of my ""jobs"" was to run out and get the mail. I did this andas  I was running back, I saw a man standing out by the warehouse in a smoking posture. As I got closer... I saw it was my dad.

I called out, ""Hey Dad!"" and he immediately threw the butt aside and turned to me, smiling, like nothing was going on. I said, ""You were smoking, weren't you? I thought you quit.""

I've never seen him look so ashamed. His shoulders slumped and he looked down at his feet. All I got was, ""Yeah, I was. I'm sorry."" It felt awkward so I just walked back into the office. My dad didn't bring it up again.

And, that was when he *really* quit. Since that moment, he completely quit smoking forever.

I still don't know exactly why he decided to stop smoking when he did, but I do feel like I was a strong factor in that decision. Somehow my catching him in that moment made him feel like he let me down - even though I was too young to really understand that kind of feeling.""I smoked for about 7 years (during college and four about 3-4 years afterwards). I have been nicotine free for 13+ years now. Here is what worked for me:

1.  You have to be ready to quit. I mean really ready. You have to be convinced that you do not want this anymore. It has to be a decision you own. It is going to get rough, if you are not fully on board with the idea, you are most likely going to fail.
2. Recognize your triggers. There are certain things that you equate with the pleasure of smoking. Maybe it is a few beers with friends, or after a great meal. Be aware that these will be the tough times. It you can make it through the triggers w/o a smoke you have done something really great. Focus your attention on getting through the triggers. Try to find something else about the triggers that you can enjoy- for example, instead of the cigarettes, appreciate the company of friends at the pub.
3. Lean on your friends and family for support. Let them know when you are struggling when you are struggling. Keeping those feelings inside will create anger and resentment. Talk through it with people you trust as you are having the feelings. A few words of encouragement can go a long way.
4. Realize that your emotions are going to be a bit out of control. You may snap or be short with others. It is going to happen. Make sure you apologize after things calm down a bit. More often than not, the people you snap at will be the folks you depend on for support.
5. This for me was the biggest one. You are an addict. Accept it. You can never, ever, under any circumstances have nicotine again. You are not going to only smoke socially or when you drink or after you get laid. You cannot trust yourself with nicotine. Anything but complete abstinence will lead back to the habit.

You can do this. It is going to be tough but it will be worth it.

Good luck.""Cold Turkey.  Played with the idea a bit, and then one day after I lit up a cigarette I decided that to smoke that cigarette was not a rational decision and discarded it. "Cold turkey and massive amounts of exercise. "Get the book ""The Easy Way to Quit Smoking"" by Allen Carr.  Every person that I have told about the book has quit.  Seriously....get the book.  Life changing.""You have to want to quit. That's the secret.  
I found out my uncle has lung cancer. He's a 50+ year smoker and the first person in my family to get cancer. That did it for me. It took me about 6 months to finally get over it and I still consider myself a smoker two years later, but I get past those cravings very easily now. I imagine it will be even easier two years from now.""
Ok, so now I'm 26.  I quit at the beginning of 2009.  So it's been 5 years.  Last couple of years, I've smoked a few cigars, no cigs.  How did I quit?

I got to the point I fucking hated smoking.  And instead of quitting, I kept smoking, hating every cigarette.  It was terrible.  I hated it so much.  I continued this for about a month.  Oh, also, I only rolled my own cigarettes, never smoked ""good"" cigarettes from a pack.  Hand rolling is fucking disgusting, you look like a homeless guy doing it, you smell really bad, they're not as satisfying as cigarettes from a pack, you smell even worse because of how you hold it.  This made me hate smoking even more.

When I finally quit, I felt so energized and happy.  I felt like I got to quit, like it was a privilege.  That weekend, I was holding cigarettes for my friends when they went in the house, shit like that, never taking a puff, everyone was amazed because I smoked SO much.

Hope this helps.

more details:

Made an account just for this.

Started smoking when I was 16.  By 18 I was smoking about half a pack a day.  By 19 about a pack a day.

Sometimes I'd wake up and it felt like I was trapped in a nightmare I couldn't get out of.  Smelled like shit, not attractive, more money than I should be spending, hate cigarette companies, no buzz except when first wake up and/ or drunk.

Would impulsively try quitting.  By impulsively, I mean would decide ""This friday, I'm going to quit."" Or I'd destroy all my cigarettes at the end of the night and flush them down the toilet.

This was a shitty cycle.  Your mind plays tricks on you big time.  I'd think ""Hmmm... live for the moment.  What's the point of life if you don't enjoy it?  You love smoking.  Think about all those really good times you've had smoking.""  Then I'd smoke again and be super fucking miserable, which saps the will to quit, on and on.

To those dicks that are like ""what, I thought you were quitting?"" when someone fails to quit.  Go fuck yourself.  You pick up smoking and quit, then we'll talk.  Anyone that's actually quit never do that shit.  I understand it's hard watching a loved one kill themselves, and it's hard to know what to do, but just don't do that if possible please.
""The psychological addiction is what got to me. The social aspect of it was hard to give up. So here's what I did.

Firstly, it's too easy to buy cigarettes, open the box, and whip out a cig. So I started rolling my own, which made it more work and it took up more time. I bought the filtered papers and a little contraption which stuffed the tobacco into the paper. Then I bought some over priced, exotic tobacco blend. Mine was some weird ""Caribbean"" blend but the point is to buy something that's nasty. Let me tell you, this shit was nasty, hardly got through a whole cig. I would smoke less and less until it was days apart and then finally not at all. It's been four years.

So you have to take the joy out of it. Make it more expensive, roll your own to make it a chore, buy some nasty tobacco blend and you'll trick your mind into disliking the act of smoking altogether.""I read the book ""The Easy Way to Quit Smoking"" by Allen Carr, it helped get my mind in the right state, but I also used the patch for longer than the recommended time to get far away from the physical habit. Good luck to you.  Smoking to me is covert suicide, you know it is going to kill you, but you do it anyway. it is a bizarre mental twist.""Not a smoker, but I used to dip/chew, so it's comparable. The first time I tried to quit I ended up caving I think three days later. I forget where I read it, but physical nicotine addiction lasts about 3 to 5 days. So realizing I caved right before the payoff made me angry with myself. As you said, you tried to quit before so you probably know this feeling. So a few days go by and I tried again, this time using the anger to talk myself out of cravings. So when I thought about it, I would tell myself how stupid it would be to reach for the can. So I threw out all remaining tobacco products, carried gum in my pocket, and every time I thought of tobacco, I threw in gum. In order to keep your mind off of it, you have to do something to distract yourself, gum worked for me. Pushing through the headache is the hardest of all. I seemed to be fine in the mornings, but usually around 2:30-3 I would get a headache I can only describe as an expanding pain sort of towards the front of my skull. For about 4 days I had that headache but in the end I knew the physical addiction was over, and it would get easier. Since then I occasionally get the urge to dip, but it passes rather quickly. Driving was my big trigger, literally every time I sat in the car I had a dip in mouth and bottle in hand. So driving for a while was the roughest part of quitting, but like I mentioned earlier, use something to distract you from your habit. Chew gum like there is no tomorrow, it helped me a lot. However I hear a lot of smokers who are trying to quit don't know what to do with their hands, so while chewing gum is all with your mouth ( like dipping ), maybe eating a sucker would be better for you because you have something to hold on to. Best of luck stranger, I hope my experience can help you out.""Not me but my dad.  He smoked for almost 40 years.  At some point he started rolling his own to save money.  He said that slowed him down a bit, because it took time.  They weren't just right there in his pocket ready to go.  So he started rolling them only when he was going to smoke on and leaving the tobacco where it was inconvenient to get at, so he had to really want a cigarette before he would stop what he was doing to smoke one.  At any rate he managed to go from 2 1/2 packs a day to under a pack.  At that point he was able to just quit.  Best of luck, the sooner you quit the better.""Cold turkey. I nutted up, and I quit.

I was at that point just smoking flavor.  

At that point, it was the habit of ""smoking"" due to the smoke not the nic.  It really works if you do it right.  I recommend checking /r/electroniccigarette, they were the reason why I quit.""My SO had been wanting to quit for a while but never had the motivation. A while before we started dating I made it very clear as an asthmatic and being allergic to tobacco that if he had any real inclination to date me they had to go. A month and a half of using an e-cig later and he was done completely. Been half a year without so much as touching the e-cig and he says he's really happy he did it. We can run together without him dying on me, and we can go out places without me having an asthma attack, it's great =]

I'm not saying its impossible, or even that it's unlikely. For example, a recovering alcoholic should not attempt to quit smoking as he is trying to stay sober, it just won't work. That is obviously an extreme case, but people should realize that different times in people's lives may increase the difficulty when trying to quit, other times it can be next to impossible. The better choice sometimes IS to wait. But don't make the mistake of putting it off for years and years and years...Hope that made sense.""Nothing too exciting about my story.

I started smoking at 14 and didn't realize it was becoming a habit till I got into college. Smoked for about 10 years. Wasn't a chain smoker but I easily smoked between 10 to 20 cigarettes a day. While I was a good student in terms of grades in school, I sucked in college. I almost left college without a degree but a final push from within helped me finish the degree and get out to get a job. Somewhere during the last days in college I made a honest assessment of what went wrong with me and my ability to study, remember things, energy and enthusiasm etc and I figured out smoking was inhibiting all that. So, I quit the day I left college. Cold turkey. 

I always loved smoking and I still do. So, I promised myself that someday when I got my life back on track, I might smoke again. It took me a few years.. about 5 I think to become professionally successful. Got married and life was good and the idiot I am I started smoking again. Got hooked again. Of course, I had a pissed wife. 10 years later, I realized that I have other health conditions which when associated with smoking can quickly give me a heart attack. 

So, what was my biggest motivation? My two little boys. The possibility that they will have to grow up without a dad to protect and help them struck me and I decided to quit again. 

It is one thing to be able to quit cold turkey when you are young and motivated. But, it is an entirely different thing when you are older and trying to quit a habit which you cultivated for 2 decades or more. 

I did a cold turkey again but I also bought a strip of nicorette and two electronic ciggies (Blu? with 400 puffs each?). Initially it was a bit difficult as expected but I just had one or 2 gums in a day say morning and evening. One can quickly get addicted to gums itself so I was determined to stop using gums after that strip. So, I turned to the electronic cigarette. I used to take 5 deep puffs whenever I needed a hit and I did this for 2 weeks and used up 2 electronic ciggies. By this time, I had already passed 3rd week with no tobacco use or an actual ciggie and I felt confident to give up electronic ciggie as well. Which I did. It's been a few months now and I am totally fine. I still do have craving but I don't have to smoke anymore. So yeah.. some good motivation, with determination and some carefully planned alternatives can help you quit. Cold turkey is difficult in the short term but is most effective. I have tried many methods.. but I can tell you confidently that this time how I quit was the most easiest way.. ever. I hardly had any withdrawal. 
I love smoking and I will always love it. Someday when I am old enough to die, I will start smoking again.

At first I just tried the patch and I realized I like the socialization of smoking so I started again after a few months. 

Then, I decided that if I was going to really quit, I needed to break my triggers. This was painful because it meant no morning cigarette with my cup of coffee, no post-meal cigarette and no drunken chain smoking. The way I overcame the last one was waiting until my roomates left town one weekend, buying a 12 pack and drinking it by myself. I knew even if I really wanted a cigarette, I wouldn't be stupid enough to drive drunk to buy some. That worked for a while but then I started working on overnights and I felt like I needed the nicotine to stay awake until 7am everyday. 

What finally got me to quit was two-fold. One, my fiancee who was just my girlfriend at the time found out that I was smoking again (she didn't work overnights and we didn't work together at the time so we only saw each other on weekends) and she was none too happy about it. Being that I loved her, I really wanted to quit. The second portion was replacing it with something positive, in my case swimming and jogging. I was really active in High School and a combination of a sedentary office job, working overnights and smoking changed that. I wasn't fat but I certainly wasn't as fit as I once was. After a few weeks of 'cutting back' and exercising, I realized that if I ever wanted to progress more towards my goals and stay with the woman I loved, I wouldn't be able to touch cigarettes again.

I had a friend who was a full-time smoker and for years he would only have between 2-4 a day, always a pack in his pocket though. I also had a family friend who was older and for health reasons he would smoke the first 6 months of the year and stop for the last 6. He did this for about 8 years and last I heard he was still doing it. I was much different than these guys, as soon as I got hooked I smoked as much as I could. If I had a pack in my pocket there was no way I could only have 2-4 a day. I would probably smoke the whole pack and buy a new one the next day.

Quitting cigarettes is hard.  For me quitting drinking was just as hard. In fact both are near impossible.  So, instead, I quit buying cigarettes.  I quit Buying alcohol. Those were much easier habits to kick.   For alcohol I actually told myself I wouldn't put my shoes in to go to the store to get beer.   Even if I failed, I had the rest of the car ride to debate it with myself.  Many times I drove back mid trip.  Other times I found myself pacing the aisles of the store arguing with myself.

I had a case of beer in my hands a couple times going to check out, but I generally managed to put it back on the shelf.  I'd drive home having purchased nothing.

Also, when I quit smoking, my friends were sick of me bumming cigarettes.  They eventually stopped letting me bum because I was trying to quit.  Those moments during class breaks when I cracked and smoked one, they eventually became less and less frequent.

Now the word makes me gag, I gagged when I typed it.

After that, cold turkey is the only way. Stop putting them in your mouth and stop lighting them. Drink cold water or chew (normal) gum. No more nicotine from that moment on.

It really is a man up thing, but crucially, completely crucially you have to want to do it, because this desire to not smoke anymore is what forms into the willpower you'll need to keep off them.

Then you're fucked. 

I'm not saying you can never have the occasional cig once you are in control, but don't do the ""just one"" thing for a good while. Once your cravings are 99% gone and one day you have one while drunk you bum one of a buddy you will probably find it disgusting due to your renewed taste. ""A combination of actually wanting to quit smoking and accepting that quitting smoking as a habit doesn't necessarily mean that I never smoke anything ever again. In my previous attempts, I didn't really *want* to quit, it was just good for my health to do so. I really enjoyed smoking. I still do. I just finally decided that the health effects, the social effects, and everything else tied to the thoroughly enjoyable act of smoking weren't worth it. Once I made that decision, it was fairly easy(ish) to go cold turkey. I just needed the actual will.

I still might have a cigarette or two if I haven't smoked in a really long time and I happen to be drunk. This usually means that I might have a cigarette once or twice a year. I'm kind of okay with that. I realize that it's a process. I realize the risk is fairly low for those instances, but if I start actually smoking again, the risk goes up significantly.

It really is honestly all about your will, though. I have a friend that quit smoking cigarettes for e-cigs, and now he's just addicted to e-cigs. In my opinion, it's like quitting energy drinks for coffee. Sure, it's a little more healthy, but it's still an addiction. Cold turkey is the way to go if you don't want to be addicted. You just have to peer deep into your self and determine whether you actually want to quit. Backsliding is a pretty good indication that you don't actually want it.

Edit: Oh, and the cravings don't go away for good. They just pop up less frequently and go away more quickly. Once you grok the addiction, you can recognize its effects in your mood and such and just move past it. I still have times where I really really want a cigarette. I know what it feels like, what sorts of things trigger it, and that it will subside.""My girlfriend wasn't down with it.

"My girlfriends dad had been smoking since he was like 15 years old. About a year ago he went to the doctor and they found a small black dot on one of his lungs. From that day forth he has not smoked a single cigarette. Pure will power & with a little motivation. "Perseverance... seriously, if you want to quit, you will quit.  I can't tell you how many times I've ""quit"", until I finally did quit.  Currently +2 years smoke free, and don't see my self going back.  As far as methods I tried most.. gum, patches, lozenges etc..  In the end the combination of patches, gum, and perseverance is what did it.  

In my struggle there always came a breaking point; the point of giving into the habit 'that one last time, one more cigarette... next time will be different' moment.  If a person can control/get through those then they're on the right path."I wish my dad would stop smoking"I, like you, had many failed attempts before I was finally able to quit. I had wanted to quit for years but had not managed to. I wanted to quit for my kids, my self, and my boyfriend so one year I made it my Valentine's day gift to them. I quit cold turkey. For me, it was impossible to essentially take back a gift I had given to kids and my boyfriend by starting back up again. Everytime I wanted to reach for one I thought of what it we be like to have to tell them I started back up. That was almost 8 years ago. Now I realize it was the best gift I've ever given myself. I can't even imagine being a smoker again. Good luck to you! I really hope you are able to find what works for you.

""I got drunk and smoked a whole pack of cigarettes one night at the bar. Considering I used to limit how many cigarettes I would have in a day, that was a lot for me. I woke up the next day and my lungs hurt so I walked to the store and bought the patch. I used it for a week and found it was pointless to even use the patch so I threw them out and just didn't let myself smoke.""I realised I was not losing anything quitting, I was gaining"I quit with an advanced personal vaporizer. Not only did I quit smoking but I picked up a new hobby. Keeps me busy tinkering with my rdas. "Well, depending on the quality of your imagination and your tendency towards anxiety... I quit cold turkey by convincing myself that if I took one more drag off a cigarette I would die. That I would literally and violently die right on the spot. When I started to get a craving I would imagine taking a drag off a cigarette and then imagine different scenarios of my demise... inside of my lungs would become instantly coated in tar and I would be unable to exchange oxygen despite gasping. Or all the blood vessels in my lungs would suddenly explode and I would die bubbling blood. Or both my lungs would suddenly collapse. Anything really dramatic and awful- having that great imagination comes in here. And then that would make me anxious, and I began to associate smoking with crushing anxiety. So I no longer wanted to smoke. 

Kind of unorthodox and I tend to get odd looks when I relate this story, but it really worked for me! Of course you need to want to quit to start the process and all of that, but this definitely helped to adhere to that!""I don't want to jinx myself, but I got a vaporizer with a few strengths of e juice and I haven't had an actual cigarette in 3 weeks. It's working wonders ""This thread is mostly about cigarettes, but as someone who recently quit smoking weed habitually, I made the decision to scale it back when going without it for a few days made me incredibly depressed. I'll probably keep doing it every once in awhile, but I never want to feel as shitty as I did again. ""This may not help you, but I smoked for 8 years. Pack and half a day by my guess. Started out fairly casual, only way to get a break in retail. By the end of college I was huffing like 2 packs a day and continued that trend.

Anyways, I never really saw it as a problem. Arrogance as a kid I guess. But one day in 2007 I was dating this girl. She of course hated the smoking. And she wanted me to quit. She wasn't an idiot. Actually was the actually top of her class and was getting ready to go to medical school, but she had this issue in which the word ""like"" was her transition word for everything. If she was really talking about an issue she knew about, she sounded like an idiot. Valley girl the whole way through.

My request is if she could go a whole week without using the word 'Like' incorrectly, I would quit smoking right then and there.

Over a whole year she would mess up and I would look at her with a grin and say ""You're killing me you know?"" And light up.

Finally one day in December of 2006, she went a whole week without saying it. And she really had stopped all together from that point saying 'like'. And I quit. Right there. I got fatter over time, but that night was my last cigarette (other than 4 years later after a marathon, we were partying and I was so drunk it seemed like I wanted to, so only one cigarette in the future).

TL;DR of that story was, you would be suprised what just your promise means to yourself.

Anyways, later in life, this was a couple of years ago. I was hanging with completely different sets of friends, and someone's wife is nagging about the same problem. Realized that I quit cold turkey, and they all asked for advise.

My answer was there is no one answer or solution. Everyone wants a trick or another chemical to 'help' them. If you wanted to quit, you would have. You don't actually want to quit, because you haven't.
I looked at him straight and said ""If you promised to quit and you didn't, that would make you a piece of shit. If you can't quit smoking at a promise to your wife, how can she believe you don't cheat, steal, hide money, gamble? If you want to quit, then you need to promise to quit, and then the punishment for failing, is not just your own inner disappointment, it's the fact that you are disappointing someone else and really just less of a man."" (paraphrase, we were drinking. I just remember the piece of shit part)

He said that he has promised before, he needs help.

I said that makes ""you weak and pathetic"". Table was silent for awhile.

Skip to months later, we all didn't see each other for awhile and all happened to run into each other at our same favorite bar, and we all sit down together and drink and pass stories. I get up to go to the bathroom and when I came out his wife was there. She said ""He hasn't smoked since that night. I really really want to thank you.""

I didn't do anything in reality. He just thought of the issue being less of something that needs treatment into something he needs to solve on his own accord. And it happenned to work this time. It doesn't for everyone because it depends on how you see yourself.

TL;DR: You aren't quitting because you don't actually want to. You know it's bad. You know you should. You deep down want to. But you aren't there. Your use of the word ""trigger"" hints this to me.

Until you believe the Cigarette is what makes you weak and really just overall shows your lack of character, you won't be able to. You believe the cigarette is what keeps you coming back, but it's you. ""My senior year in college, I was on about a pack a day. I was overworked and stressed, barely slept, etc. I used to love running in the past, and multiple times I tried to force myself to take up running again in order to force me to quit. My first attempt failed, since after about a week I hurt my knee, couldn't run anymore, and started smoking again. But after my knee got better, I started running again and haven't smoked since. You can't run 3-6 miles every day and smoke. It just doesn't work. ""I might be completely off here, but I read one time that your physical craving for nicotine is gone after three days, and after that, it's all mental and oral fixations. Without bothering to confirm this fact, whenever I plan to quit, I embrace for a tough three days (and therefore usually time it with something that I will enjoy doing for three days, like a planned vacation), and then after that, it is usually pretty easy to stay off.

That said, I have never quit smoking for more than a year, and always come back (so far). But in my defense, I have never ""failed"" to quit for at least 9-12 months when I do try. Also, my reason for coming back is almost always stupid (""I can smoke this one cigarette... oh, why not buy a pack... oh shit!"")""Alan Carr quit smoking the easy way. It is a bit like brainwashing, but it worked. I quit cold turkey and it was easy""Quitting cold turkey, feeling like I was going through some kind of drug detox, and removing myself from smokers. Been smoke free for over 5 years now.""I woke up one morning with 6 dollars to my name, no food and no smokes. I made a choice. Three years later I still don't smoke. 
""I quit 10 months ago, it was my second attempt. The doctor recommended using Chantix, but a friend told me how horrible the side effects were. I had a follow up appointment in 7 days, and said if I had smoked any cigarettes between that appointment and the next I'd take chantix. I was afraid of Chantix and knew it was only 7 days, so I just gutted it out. 

Big helps:
1. Popsicles after meals/when I had cravings.
2. We have a large ash tray outside, which I'd fill with water and breath in if I really wanted one (it was fucking disgusting)
3. I continued to smoke pot.

Cautions:
1. Took way more than 7 days to kick the withdrawls
2. I was an absolute asshole at work, but my co-workers were considerate of my circumstances.
3. Let people know you are ""Trying"" to quit, even if you havent smoked in 2-3 weeks. This way when drinking (the hardest test) people will refuse to give you cigarettes.

Mind set:
Dont put a cigarette to your lips"I quit the next day after breaking up with a SO. I forced myself to condition myself to think about that person every time a craved a cigarette. Haven't smoked in 8 months. Haven't yet but am down to 2-3 a day from a pack. I tapered off a few months back. Soon I feel like I will be able to cold turkey without a huge issue since my dosage has gotten so small.Realizing how white trash it is.  Every white trash piece of shit in the world smokesUnfortunately I only quit smoking but didn't quit nicotine. Still use [snus \(snuff\)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Portioned_snus.jpg) and even though it's not good for me it's still better than smoking."ITT: People quitting because it negatively affected someone they love. My dad told me my grandfather quit cold turkey because his wife, whom he loved very much, was suffering from lung problems. Doctors told him that his smoking wasn't helping and he just put it down overnight.""A bucket of cold water to the face worked for my grandpa.
I just assumed he was on fire when he blew smoke out his nose.""I smoked casually throughout college. Probably about a pack every week or so? Sometimes more, sometimes less.

I stopped enjoying it. Realized that it gave me literally zero benefit, and took away a lot of things. That plus having a baby and not wanting her to inhale any cigarette smoke made the decision to quit pretty easy.

It wasn't very difficult. I wasn't very addicted I suppose.""Watching my mother die slowly and very painfully from lung cancer at the age of 60, After that i just stopped.""Telling myself how ""bad"" cigarettes were did nothing to change my behavior. I had to find something that was more pleasurable than cigarettes. Vaping, e cigarettes with a cartomizer tank and liquid was the ticket. The trick is to get enough nicotine and flavor that when you do go back to try an analog it will taste disgusting. The rest is discipline and changing your story about who you are. You are now in the vaping community. Not in the cigarette community. Let go of your identity for a new identity. This is a fine step in the correct direction, which is the direction you REALLY want to go in, that of being able to breath, being in control of your health and free of the addiction to 11,000 contaminates in an analog. Most people will move toward pleasure and away from pain. Trust that in yourself the next time you pick up your e-cigarette.""My wife.

She asked me, repeatedly (""pestered"" is how I would've described it then) to stop. She urged this so we could have a long, healthy(ier?) life together.

Eventually it sunk it. It's worth it more to be with her, than to smoke. As much as I loved it, and miss it. I miss it less every year though.""For me I got a really bad cold in the beginning of the year. I didn't smoke for 1.5 weeks. After it was one I had no cravings an thought to myself, ""well I've gone this far, might was well keep going."""I just stopped. Literally had red marks of toxins being released. "Will power and a willingness to quit.

It's not that hard if you have a goal. Think of it as bettering yourself rather than losing an old friend."Bupropionsmokers like you just have to wait till you have a big health scare and even then maybe your Insane enough to keep smoking. just remeber your ways fine before it to late and your screwed. it takes 20 years to heal lung damage. it's possible it's to late for you depending you age. You could be permanently damaged till the day you die. quiting smoking is fairly easy really. It's quiting and never ever again smoking after that. "For me it was the emergency room visit where the told me I had already had a heart attack at some point in the last two years, and that my blood pressure was so high I was in serious danger of having a stroke.  I know its so cliche to say ""when you are young you think you are invincible"" - I had that mindset.  I'm 38 and had smoked about 1.5 pack a day for 20 years - I have permanent heart damage.  

The more you realize that the negative health effects WILL happen to you (every puff gets you closer), the easier it will be to remain steadfast and resist smoking that next one.""My wife almost died- not from smoking, but from an ectopic pregnancy. I had EASed on January 4th of 2011 from the Marines and she wanted me to quit- I had been a pack a day smoker for four years at that point and I'd started in high school. We argued- a lot- about my smoking but it seemed irrelevant when in the same sentence a doctor told me that I might be a dad soon, but she's lost a lot of blood. (He said ""hey dad- her pregnancy test is positive"" and we didn't know at that point why exactly she was in a ton of pain and was passing out (Jan 27th, 2011). I hit my three year mark of no smoking two days ago. I stopped cold turkey (cheated a couple times drunk, got really sick). For over a year, though, I didn't actually say that I quit. I didn't tell anyone, I didn't say it to myself. I kept a pack in my truck and my garage. I even bought fresh packs. I was only ""trying not to smoke."" My best friend was our roommate and he was a smoker, so when he went out for a smoke I'd keep my hands occupied, do push-ups, whatever. Or I'd just say to myself that ""I'll smoke later."" After a while I didn't want to smoke at all.""Company started a surcharge for smokers.  $40 a paycheck was just too much (plus the cost of cigarettes), I quit cold turkey.""Takes an average of 7-10 times to quit so don't loose hope! 

I tried gums, lozenges, and the patches and what ended up working for me was running.  Yes running almost every day.  I got so bothered by my wheezing when I would run and it would put the negative effects directly in front of my consciousness that i eventually went cold turkey.

The other thing is just making it past the first 2 weeks is the hardest after that it is a lot easier!   
"Chantix worked for the wife and I."For me- finding ways to keep myself active and keep my mind frm smoking. I have an oral fixation so when I drive I have a particular tendency towards it... So I drink water. LOTS of it. I would say quit cold turkey. Don't do the ecigs. Try eating candy or taking a walk... Workout even! It'll work out in the long run. 

I am on my (hopefully) last attempt. I haven't smoked in 4 days ;) wish me luck!

And good luck to u, and everyone else out there looking to quit. It's a disgusting habit...""Just like finding some sort of ritual in the morning to help you get up, you just have to man up and get out instantly. Just like stopping with smoking;  man up and stop fucking smoking."Champix. A miracle drug IMO."The Only Way to Stop Smoking Permanently by Alan Carr.

I also know people who have had good results from E-Cigs."What really helped me was not being around smokers for about two weeks. I was starting with family that didn't smoke and broke my eCig. Decided to throw my last five analogs out and it's been about eight months. "I found quitting smoking to be a mental game. Your body gets past the physical need for nicotine rather quickly. It's the habit that's hardest to break. For that, you need to recognize the triggers, make changes to your routine, and just tough it out. There are no two ways about it. It sounds to me like you might be sabotaging your own efforts by repeating the behaviors you already associate with smoking (i.e. going outside on break, using e-cigs, etc.) Things like patches, gum, and e-cigs are just stopgap measures. They might take a bit of the edge off, but ultimately will not get you to where you need to be. Only will power, and perhaps a healthier substitute, can do that. For me it was popsicles (maybe not the healthiest choice but better than tar and carcinogens). I was burning through 1/2 a box a night of those things for several months but it worked. I haven't touched a cigarette in 12 years and I won't. If I do, I know I'll go right back to smoking. The physical craving is long gone but the habit can very easily re-emerge. Hell, even just typing this response is triggering a craving for me. I'm not sure they ever truly go away. They just become fewer and farther between and less intense. You will learn to control them. Of course, the worst is when you're around another smoker. When you can do that without lighting up you know you've beaten it. 

Take heart. It can be done. As others have pointed out, find a reason to quit and hone in on it. Stay strong and focused. There will be times you have to dig really, really deep to find the strength to resist it but before long you will gain the upper-hand. Good luck!""I used to go out on all my smoke breaks at work and chew two extra strong mints and inhale - the burn from the mints satisfied the physical craving

Just having found out my wife was pregnant gave me the will to quit - best decision I ever made!!""Acute bronchitis. I had developed asthma from smoking and nearly every cold I got turned into bronchitis. This last time it was so bad that I spent all day and night in bed for about two weeks. When I got up to use the restroom, I'd be out of breath by the time I got to the bedroom door. I was coughing so hard that I though my brain was going to explode out the back of my skull.

At the time, I was living at my mom's, so I couldn't smoke indoors. The effort to get up, go downstairs and outside to smoke kept me from having any cigarettes. (Yes, in spite of how awful I felt, I still wanted to smoke.) After about three days of no smoking, I decided not to start again. I told myself that the first few days of quitting are the hardest and since I had already gotten through those, I should take advantage of the situation. I haven't smoked since then, 13 years ago. ""At my grandmother's funeral, who died of lung cancer, my grandfather came up to me crying, and told me that he wanted me to quit smoking because he didn't want the last 4 years of my life to be the same hell that my grandmother's were.  So yeah.   Quit the next day.  Only time I had ever seen my grandfather cry.""Take one of your cigarettes, submerge it in milk, leave it out to dry overnight, and then smoke the entire thing in the morning. It will be horrible. You will throw up. But in the end it'll be easier to fight off the urge to smoke. From there follow the advice of the top comment and do your best to quit cold turkey.""Fear of getting cancer. Realising that smoking is a disgusting habit that has no benefit. Quit cold turkey 7 years ago and haven't looked back, get the odd urge now and again.""Got married.

Seriously, my (then) fiancÌ© said if she was going to marry me, then it was going to be for as long as possible.  I loved smoking and had no desire to quit.  However, her response put my habit (and my decision to marry) in perspective.

I quit cold turkey the next morning. The next few weeks I bought many, many packs of peppermint flavored gum, and any time I had a craving I'd keep popping another piece of gum.

I'm happily married now for almost 10 years and no relapse.  I guess the real secret was having a purpose in quitting otherwise you have an excuse to go back to smoking.""The biggest thing for me was my peer group. I started smoking with my friends that also smoked. Quitting was hard because I was always around them and smoking was very much a part of that group identity. When I stopped hanging around them (job opp) and other smokers, I had fewer triggers and was more stigmatized for smoking by non smokers. The majority of smokers know they're addicted and want to quit. In my experience, peer pressure is more powerful than anything else to get people over the hump. ""my parents are from boston but I grew up in VA. my mom sent my dad for cigarettes and it took him forever to come back because people in Virginia can't drive in the snow. I was 4, my brother was a baby. so she became convinced that she just sent her husband to die in a snowstorm and she was widowed with two small kids. It took him awhile but he came home with her cigarettes. By then she didn't want them. This from a woman who smoked in her hospital room when I was born. (She got in trouble.) (I'm not THAT old lol.) 

She did fake smoke baby carrots for awhile to get over it though. I was too young to figure out that was weird. 

edit: I still smoke. I don't have kids. ""The most effective thing is when you one day catch yourself lighting up a cigarette almost involuntarily every time you open a door to step outside.. making no more of a conscious effort to do so than breathing or blinking.. you catch yourself doing this, and you become sickened with the habit you developed and it makes it a whole lot easier to make the commitment to stop. ""I started when I was 13.  Got up to almost 3 packs per day.  I also smoked cigars, pipe tobacco cigars like Black & Milds, and chewed Redman Golden Blend.  My wife had to go stay in the hospital with her dad for a couple days.  I texted her and said ""No more smoking in the house.""  I have not had ANY nicotine other than maybe some second hand smoke since then.  I am now 32.  I quit cold turkey.  It will be one full year Feb 7.

I tried to cut down and e cigs etc. Nope.  That just keeps feeding the addiction.  I tell myself now that I am better than my addictions and I only have to make it past the urge to have it.  I am working on my food addiction now.  It is very hard.  Harder than quitting smoking. /r/loseit helps.

BTW a pharmacist is a great resource. They're the most accessible healthcare workers and a good one will help you plan a quit date and avoid what is triggering cravings.

I'd speak with management about the lack of breaks. Most businesses have abandoned the only smokers get breaks idea.

If your smoking is just behavioral, as in you just do it cause you like to or to get a break atwork, its a behavioral problem, in which case cold turkey and supportive friends is the best method. If you need one within half an hour of waking up, its physical ane you need the gum or patch. The middle type of addiction is psychologic, as in you get anxious. For this its best to see a doctor."Trees"Come to terms with the fact that you are a drug addict. That the cigarette doesn't relax you, it removes the anxiety the withdrawal causes.

I convinced myself I had to do it for me and quit cold turkey. I live in a house full of smokers, and ive cheated a couple times. I'm optimistic i'm going to keep.

Hope this helps.""I quit dipping a month ago (I know it's not smoking) but it's nicotine and nicotine is a bitch! I still have strong cravings... Especially right after I eat. (That was my favorite time to throw a dip in).... Every time a craving comes I just think about the consequences of dipping. From tooth decay to having chunks of my jaw removed. Then I look up a couple of pictures on the internet of jaw cancer.... 

My mind always try's to play tricks on me though... It's like ""hey just buy a can dood every one at work does it and they are just fine! All we have to do is buy one more can and were done no more dipping after that""

Do these cravings ever go away? ""What worked best for me was to avoid being around other smokers, and staying away from cigarette smoke.

also coughing up black was good incentive for me. ""Ill never forget the way that my father quit smoking. I was 8 or 9 years old and we were on a long drive. He had already smoked a cigarette during the drive and as he reached for another one, he looked at it and threw the pack out the window. It was pretty badass and I never saw him smoke again. Something must have set him off to quit""My then-girlfriend now-wife asked me if I smoked, to which I nervously said ""yeah, sometimes."" I waited for her to tell me how much she disliked smoking, or how bad it is for you, but she just said ""huh."" She never brought it up again.

Days, weeks passed and I waited for her to tell me to stop, to give me any condition at all. She sneakily kept her own counsel and finally out of sheer frustration I quit. Still no response from her, nothing at all. I'm pretty sure if she had said a word to push me toward quitting I would have found a reason to continue, but as it was I got more and more ashamed until I couldn't take it any more.

I told her years later how clever she had been, and how perfectly she had judged me in not making a fuss about it. She had no idea what I was talking about.""Well, I was able to quit smoking very easily, because I never smoked tobacco, I only ever smoked weed. And I don't anymore because that shit isn't chemically addictive (the only way that it's habit forming is that it's a pleasant experience, much like drinking chocolate milk or something).

/unjerk but seriously, if you're gonna smoke something, smoke weed, not tobacco. Just make sure the weed comes from a source you can support, like a medical or local source, NOT some cartel gangster shit in fuckin' Mexico or Colombia.""Always pay at the pump...

Believe it or not but that combined with a strong will is all it took. Cold turkey is the only way that works imo, but it's sure difficult.""My dad quit when my little sister asked why it says ""smoking kills"" etc. on all the packages and whether he doesn't like his life with us.""I watched my stepmom die from lung cancer.  
I started smoking when I went through a rough divorce so I'd only been smoking a couple of years which I'm sure makes it a little easier. She was supposedly in remission, but it came back with a vengeance. Seeing her go through chemo and radiation put it in my head that I should stop while I'm still young and in reasonably good health, but I never quite could even with acupuncture, gum, patches, all that fun stuff. However seeing the pain and desperation along with her body literally gasping for air those last few days did it. It's probably the same as ""you have to really want to"", but I think having that ""this could be me in the future"" visual really gave me the motivation I needed. It was a terrible thing to have to see and I don't want to endure that or make my family see me go through anything like that if I can avoid it.  
Quitting wasn't easy. I gained weight, I was cranky, I still occasionally crave a smoke when I'm out with friends, but it's so worth it. I've saved a small fortune ($6 a day adds up), the world smells and tastes better and my teeth are whiter. All in all, totally worth it.

""My dad smoked from when he was a teenager to last year, now 55. He tried many times cold turkey on his own and even tried nicorette gums but they didn't work. He used chantix once and hasn't had a cig since. He said it gave him weird dreams but he doesn't have any urges any more. Probably the best give he's ever given me or my brother since we've pestered him for so many years.""I'm going to be one year non smoker in February. I tried quitting multiple times, using various methods. But what worked for me was genuinely wanting to quit. Easier said than done, but Allen Carr's book easiest way to quit smoking. Put smoking in such a way, that I felt like an idiot for smoking. I only read half the book but the ideology had been planted. I quit cold turkey. I didn't announce it to the world either. I think that helped a lot. I just let people notice in wasn't smoking anymore, instead of announcing to the world ""I'm quitting"". No lie, wasn't hard at all once I actually wanted to quit. You have to actually WANT to quit, no secrets, no special tricks. But Allen Carr's book on quitting smoking definitely helps to get your mind right about smoking. ""I smoked for eleven years. My fiancÌ© told me she was pregnant  while I was smoking. I decided that I am not going to be like my parents and make smoking okay for my child, so I threw my pack of cigarettes in the fire and haven't smoked since. If you can make it 7 days without smoking, you've made it, there is no reason to go back after that.  Also a good thing to do is get bubble gum, or sunflower seeds to replace the hand to mouth action. ""Haven't bought a pack in over a year. Electronic cigarettes has kept me away, I know that it isn't actually quitting smoking. I still get the sensation of smoking, I get the nicotine, and I don't smell like an ashtray. Had over to /r/electronic_cigarette for info "I started running.  My body was in terrible shape and I just couldn't bare the thought of my body degrading any further so I started running.  The uncomfortable congestion in my chest grew to a burning pain as I started running further distances and it was a toss up: give up running or give up smoking.  I just kept running.Chewing on toothpicks"Vaping. Especially once I found one that was more delicious and satisfying than a cigarette. After a couple months of that, I tried a cigarette and for the first time in my many attempted quits, it was the most repulsive damned thing I'd ever tasted. Vaping has become a hobby and something that satisfies the ritual/act of smoking, which is what I personally missed the most - I even vape 0-nicotine juice, because I like the taste and the hand-mouth-inhale-exhale motion.""At work this guy came in and had seen me smoking outside on a break. He came up to me and said ""You know that's bad for you?"" and like a big butt face I said ""really? I never knew?"" A few weeks later he came in again and said ""A few years ago I quit after 30 years of smoking, and you know the secret? Prayer.""  So a) I felt like a total moron from being rude to him the first time he came in, second, I got back in touch with God, and after praying for a while I was finally able to quit. No e-cigs, no patches, gum, etc. Just the power of God. It wasn't easy, but it was the only way I would have been able to do it."Promised my wife I'd stop smoking when we had a baby.  I don't break promises [edit] to my wife."What actually worked was convincing myself that i wanted to quit. For a long time I told myself that i didn't give a shit, and I didn't care if it eventually killed me. Then I started to think about my life, and what my future would be like. What if i did meet someone and fall in love? What if i had kids and a great job and my life turned out ok, only to find out I had cancer and was going to die. That's what convinced me; that smoking wasn't going to kill me when i didn't give a shit, but when i did. I also began to worry that I would get throat cancer or something and have my face ripped apart and have to go on looking like [this](http://imgur.com/fOcd9Ge) and be unable to speak. I also used a e-cigarette (no nicotine) to help with the oral fixation part. It's actually been a year today since I quit, and everyday i say to myself 'I'm so glad I quit when i did'.""This going to sound ridiculous but I've quit several times. And when I say quit I mean for long stretches of time. 2+ years most of the time. I once quit for 13 years. I started smoking at a very early age. Now when something major and huge happens in my life I might grab a smoke, but it mostly comes down to me having a shitty attitude at the time and feeling self destructive. 

The only way I've quit is to value myself and just WANT to quit. Hypnosis never worked for me. Cutting back is just cutting back. Ecigs helped me the last time I quit, but only to stop craving that smoke in my lungs. The habit was still there. Ultimately I found an intrinsic want to stop and did. Been over 5 months this time and I haven't had a craving.

No making excuses for yourself. No saying you can have one because you haven't smoked in a week. Don't think of cigarettes as a reward. Put your adult pants on.

Oh and as proud as you are for quitting, don't be that dick that rubs it in other smoker's faces. I only mention it if my friends who smoke notice I haven't been smoking.

I'll probably smoke again, and quit again, but it's easier to deal with and actually quit when you know you can."masterbating helped when i have an urge. "On January 15 of this year, I hit my 3 year mark for not smoking.  I haven't had a single cigarette since January 14 2011.  I'd smoked for 16 years previously, and the last 5 years or so I smoked between 1 pack a day (for days that I was fairly busy) up to 2 packs a day (days that I had nothing going on, or days where I was driving to go to work in another state or come home from a job.)  I'd tried to quit several times before, and I was always a very emotional quitter - I would cry at the drop of a pin, I wouldn't sleep, I would eat EVERYTHING, and then 2 or 3 days later I'd pick up the coffin nails again out of desperation.  I'd tried patches, I'd tried nicotine inhalers... nothing seemed to work for me until this last time.

For me, I successfully quit this time because I was **ready**.  I still *wanted* to smoke - hell, I still want to smoke right now sometimes! - but I was ready to quit spending the money, ready to get healthier.  I accepted beforehand that I would keep trying to quit until I was successful.  It's like running a marathon, maybe... you aren't going to win the first time you put on running shoes.  But keep getting out there, keep getting a little better, work through your failures, and eventually, you'll finish the marathon.  You might be in last place, but keep going, and maybe you'll get to the front of the pack.

My fiance and I quit together.  A week beforehand, I'd bought a pack of patches and a pack of lozenges, just in case.  We never touched them.  I also bought a big bag of Dum Dum suckers, and I enjoyed those for a few days to get over the hand-to-mouth thing.  After the second or third day, I didn't even think about them anymore.

I still LOVE the smell of a freshly lit cigarette.  We still sit in the smoking section when we go out to eat.  We still hang around with our smoking friends. We just don't smoke ourselves anymore - and a good thing, too, because we needed the extra funds!  I've noticed, though, that when I spend time with my brother, mother, and sister-in-law (all heavy smokers) I get very congested at the end of the day, and I can finally smell the smoke odor associated with my clothes after a day with them.

My advice, if you're looking for a break - go out for a cigarette break, but without the cigarette or e-cig!  Or, pick up some of the nicotine free vaping liquid.  Either way, you will successfully quit when you are ready. Don't look at it as a failed attempt, just look at it as another chance to try again.  I'm not normally a cheesy-motivational-poster kind of person, but I've given the same advice to many people, many of whom have successfully gone on to quit.  Make sure you are quitting because YOU are ready, and don't beat yourself up if you don't make it.  Get up, brush off, relax, and try again next time you're ready.""You aren't going to like this answer.  But truth is: there is no secret.  You just have to do it.  I know it's hard,  but it's gets easier. (After a year or two)"You said you have an ecig but I ended up getting a nice one online that you refill and I cheated a couple times with a couple I had left but once that pack ran out I was done. Try investing in a good ecig. "I was treated intensively for a month after a severe burn, and they told me ""if you want to heal you'll stop smoking"".  It really hit me that it's not just my lungs or just my breath that are negatively effected by the smoking - it's everything, right down to the entire healing process! 

sitting down and really imagining being older and being dependent on this stupid stick of paper and leaves to make you feel good.  I envisioned myself being one of those moms who smoke with the kids in the car and step out of the restaurant to smoke in the cold and smell like death.  What tipped the scale was meeting a man with terminal lung cancer on a plane one time. We talked for hours, and he told me ""every cigarette I smoked took a little piece of my life away"" and ""if I could trade all of them back for a few more years, I'd do it""

I recently tried to smoke again (drunk of course) after not touching them for 3 months; part of me was curious to see if it'd feel like reuniting with my best friend.  Turns out, it tasted like garbage, just as it did the first time I tried it at 15.  FUCK YOU SMOKING I WIN.
""I used herbal tobacco along side nicotine gum. With the herbal tobacco I was still able to go through the ritual of rolling and having a smoke with my mates,  it the smoke was thin and horrible. The nicotine gum (which isn't actually unhealthy) satisfied my craving. I just naturally started cutting down because I no longer wanted to smoke the herbal tobacco.
  
  I still chew the gum, but inks a few pieces per day, and when I go on holiday, I don't miss it. Good luck and I hope you find what works for you!""I have only quick for 2 weeks now but I was a dipper and smoker.
I chew trident gum and change flavors every pack to mix it up and chew a lot of sunflower seed.

Once you get caught lying once or twice about it it becomes a big deal.  Smoked close to a pack a day for 8 years and quit cold turkey, best decision I ever made.  I did have to stop hanging out with smokers at work because the urge was strong initially but after a few days it is just mental.""After ""quitting"" 8 times (3 by gum, 1 by patches, 4 cold turkey) the only thing that's worked is a quality vape/e-cig.

The next day, when i got to work I didn't listen to those voices...went straight into the office. Never smoked again.  "Quit when I had the flu and hadn't been smoking for a few days. Was not hard."(Should you be truly determined) All you do is stop. Those cravings you get? It'll go away, but you need to lay it off right now. NO EXCUSES.
(Should the trigger be something you're forced to deal with every day) Is that not still an excuse? (Oh, I'll just have one today to help me out) Still an excuse. If you truly want to quit, pick a day, start and commit. Turn down offers, don't bum a stoge, don't buy a pack.  It comes down to sheer willpower. You forced yourself into this place, now it's up to you to get yourself out.

The best tip I can think of to upholding your resolve is to stop thinking about cigarettes. After all that time smoking, you've mentally trained yourself into a habit. If you smoked because of work being stressful, in your mind cigarettes are your stress reliever. Replace the cigarettes with something else. 

Not ecigs though. I believe theyre useless. It may be marketed as cleaner than smoking (to an extent possibly since it's vaping), but you're still repeating the same actions as smoking (inhaling with your mouth and releasing the smoke). People say they're addicted to nicotine, I found I was smoking due to the habitual repetition of that action over and over again.

And another thing, regardless of how bad you want to quit, if you know you're going to smoke another cigarette by the end of the day, or week, leave that quitting mentality out of your mind. Don't think about it. Because the next time you want to quit, you'll repeat that same process of thinking over again (oh i'll quit, but just another cigarette). Can't think of how many friends I know have dragged on quitting (myself included) in such a manner.""I quit 100 times .. And was able to finally stop on my 101st try ..

I was rarely even a ""pack a day"" smoker too. What made me quite was that it's just not socially acceptable to smoke these days. I know it never WAS socially acceptable but what I'm talking about is that it used to be cool to see actors smoke in movies, tv shows, remember the ""smoking or non smoking"" question you would get before going to your seat at a restaurant? Yeah, it's just not cool anymore, and that's all it took for me, and with that I just did cold turkey.

When I saw the cast of the Jersey shore in HD smoking and their wrinkled dry faces sucking in the smoke I became disgusted. That and comparison pictures of twins where one was a smoker and one wasn't ultimately lead to my quitting.

"Wellbutrin. I have ADHD and therefore impulse control problems. I smoked from the time I was 12. I really found after about a week on the medication that I could talk myself through cravings rather than being unable to get past that initial urge. Soon I made it one day. After that it was easy. "LSD. I was flying high in New York City, enjoying a cigarette, when I noticed a truck idling nearby. It was spewing out clouds of noxious fumes. I looked back and forth between its exhaust and my cigarette a few times, and felt viscerally that they were the same thing.

Horrified by the idea that I was willingly doing this to myself, I put out my cigarette, and threw it and the rest the pack away then and there.""I haven't smoked a cig in almost 2 years. I tried using the e-cig but i had the same problem i would smoke both.  finally one day i decided i wanted to quit. so i picked a date and gave myself about 2 weeks. I chose April 1st.  The week prior i cut down drastically to about a pack for the whole week, then when April 1st came around, I stopped completely, and i haven't picked one up since.  Honestly the first few days are the hardest, but after the physical dependance wears off you have to battle with the ending the habit.  For me, I would just take a hit of some cannabis whenever I had a craving (the first week i was stoned pretty much 24/7) but after a while my cannabis use went back to normal.  Unfortunately i still get completely random cravings almost 2 years later, but they are so much easier to ignore. Good luck!

TL;DR I quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey all thanks to marijuana.""I went to the cottage August long weekend. My girlfriends dad had invited a friend and his pregnant girl friend who was extremely over weight and gross. The whole weekend she was smoking cigarettes, drinking coolers and eating a huge stash of chips,cookies and candy she brought for the week. After seeing how gross and disgusting she looked. I told my self I didn't want to effect my health or be gross like that or make poor life decisions.  I stopped smoking that day. She lost the baby a month before it was due. Very sad. But not sure what was expected. ""I started chewing a lot of gum and then I started smoking more weed. 
Currently not smoking anything at all for the sake of school and saving money.""Not a smoker, but I heard this interesting story on Radiolab recently about a woman who made an agreement that she'd donate $5000 to the KKK if she started smoking again and it helped her quit. http://www.radiolab.org/story/117165-help/""Take up pipe smoking.  I know, it sounds ridiculous, but you don't actually inhale pipe smoke, so you're getting your nicotine but not in such a large amount.  And the smoke is so harsh you won't smoke a whole pipeful, I'd usually just puff a few times to get my fix and then throw the rest out. 

Also, use a corn cob pipe, because that way when you're smoking at a bar you'll look like a complete fool.  I did this and quit within a few months, the thing you have to realize is that when you're craving a cigarette, all you really need is that first puff, so if you give yourself that but make it as awkward as possible by using a pipe, you'll eventually drown the cravings.""I was traveling in Europe and cigarettes were so expensive that I had to decide between drinking and smoking. The first weeks were bad; I was dying for a cigarette and every time someone offered one, I took it without hesitate. Then everything went a little bit easier; I was feeling anxious anymore, I found myself attending parties and bars without smoking even one! And that became an habit until today. I have 10 years without smoking. ""I gave up when the price of 20 cigs was around å£1.50 thinking it was a waste of money then, now the equivalent is somewhere in the region of å£6.00.

Plain and simple. Anything you like to do that involves smoking, stop. It's not forever, but for a long while. Because anything like that, that you do after you quit, will make you want to smoke. Some stuff is unavoidable. Like driving or eating. But there are a lot of things you can change.

Do you drink and smoke? Quit. Do you play MMOs and smoke? Unsubscribe. Do you go to a friends house and chat and smoke on the porch all night? Stop. Make a list of everything in your life that you do that involves smoking. Change your routines. Change your life style. Change your bed time :P


After that, it doesn't matter. The patch worked for me. The gum works for others. Cold turkey if you are brave. After getting through the first few days it's easy. As long as you aren't going places or doing things that will put you in a tough position. Like well everyone else is smoking, it's been awhile. One can't hurt... Why were you there in the first place? 

The last thing, find something else to get addicted to for a while. I did Scrubs. Watched the entire series over the course of a month on my phone and iPad depending on where I was. Went to bed early and watched scrubs. Took breaks in the break room or my bosses office and watched scrubs. It helped. Gave me something else to crave (MUST WATCH SCRUBS NOW RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE).

Let's be clear I'm not one of those ""iron will"" guys.
I've tried several time in the past. My actual mate asked me to stop smoking a lot of time.

She stops when pregnant of our son and i've deceived her.
we got several discussion and a couple of harsh arguments that ends up the ""trust"" that she can have into me if I keep lying to her.

But none of these threatening consequences convinced me at all.
Of course I was feeling guilty and weak. But there was always something that tempt me with ""the last one"".

Until one day i realize a simple concept.
Everytime i've accomplished something i feel the urge of smoking a cigarette as a prize to myself.
The plain stupidity of this concept shock me.
The cigarette itself do not amuse me. I didn't like the taste, the flavor or anything else. It was just an habit. An useless one.

So i just decided to quit. And the first days was not so hard honestly. I work in an office full of other people smoking but everytime someone ask for a smoke-break i just remember myself that i feel good even without.

For the first couple of months i've avoided going out with the others while they smoke. They knew my goal and does not complain about it.
After a couple of months i begin to use the smoke-break from time to time to chat while others was smoking.

It was seven months the last 11 January (i've had to check my calendar). 

Anyway, still today sometimes i miss the coffee and cigarette on my balcony after a good dinner with my mate but it's the feeling that I miss, not the cigarette.

"After 7000 or so posts I guess nobody will read this. But I was a pack-and-a-half a day smoker for twenty years. I went to a Learning Annex class to stop smoking given by a hypnotherapist. It worked. Never had another ciggie. "I used to smoke. I quit a few times, but always started back up. What got me to quit for good was getting back into lifting and the occasional distance running. It's nearly impossible to lift heavy or run far with the injured physiology of a smoker and once I stopped inhaling garbage into my lungs I felt far better.

I do sometimes bum a smoke when I've been drinking all night on a Saturday though. :( ""Go to college and realize you can spend money on alcohol, weed or tobacco. Alcohol wins for me every time.""I smoked from age 14-26, and my brand of choice was Camel Wides.  I have been without cigarettes for about 8 mos.  Let me tell you right off the bat.  I love smoking, I will always love smoking.  I will never **not** love smoking.  

Anyway, I switched to those [NJoys](http://www.njoy.com/) and used them for about 2-3 months.  And in that time I just didn't like the substitute. It didn't burn my throat how I liked, it didn't give me that same relaxed feeling.  Albeit, it curbed the nicotine that I was craving.  But once I started to use it less and less, I was able to chemically reduce my want for smokes.  And after a little bit of time I was reaching for it less and less.  Which, also started to decrease my habit style addiction.  Such as after breakfast, after a dump, driving in the car.  Y'know, all the good things in life that were made better with smoking.  

Then after a while, my need for smokes was decreasing on all fronts and I just stopped using the NJoys.  I didn't stop cold turkey, when I started using the NJoys I still had a cigarette here and there.  But I think I may have Pavlov dogged myself.  I basically switched my smoking to something I wouldnt enjoy, and then just stuck with it until I felt I was comfortable having it out of my system.  

But between then and now, I don't have ravenous cravings for cigarettes, but when I am drinking I will automatically think that I should have one.  But I dont.  I do pretty well, I don't crave the cigarettes all the time, but I do miss it.  Almost like when you break up with someone you just love so goddamn much, but you know that the type of love you share is toxic to your health and the only way to get away is to cut away completely.  Even writing this, I almost feel like I am romanticising it. I;m sorry, I just can't help it.  Also, unlike others I didn't start running... in fact I actually put on weight after I quit smoking.  haha.  Whoops.  But it is something that I miss, and as long as I stay an active non-smoker I will always miss it.   

Also, sorry if this isn't just blind positive thinking to encourage others that, ""if I did it, so can you!"", but the truth is if it wasn't for the fact that it was damaging my health and made me smell I would smoke until the day I died.

Then she was able to get nearly every smoker she knows to switch, and many of them have tapered off by now.   

She got into getting a nicer e-cig, the type you can't just get in your local 7/11, and got into getting flavoured juices off the internet. It became a hobby basically until she was able to get off it all together. She was excited about quitting because she was passionate about the e-cig stuff.

Your motivation needs to be **powerful and meaningful to you**. It's going to be your touchstone. It is what is going to keep you in check during your cravings.

2. **Support**. Quitting alone is incredibly difficult. I was a closet smoker for a long time, so this is one thing I struggled with. No one knew I smoked (or at least they never admitted it to me), so I didn't have anybody to lean on, or talk to, or just vent to. Every time I tried to quit on my own I failed. Now support doesn't have to mean friends and family. I spent a lot of time at /r/stopsmoking, and that helped tremendously. I also downloaded a stop smoking app that acted as my cheerleader. It shows me how long it's been since I smoked, how many cigarettes I've skipped, how much money I've saved, and all the current health benefits I can expect. Right now I'm watching the meter fill up until my lung cancer risk drops back to normal. The bottom line is you need a cheerleader to push you, and someone or something to lean on when you're weak. 

3. **Commitment**. This one is a little harder to put in to words, and I suppose it could go hand in hand with motivation. But one thing that helped me was to go cold turkey. I tried patches and gum. I tried weening. None of it worked. It was too easy to fall back into old habits. My personal theory on why is that you take something you are trying to get rid of (nicotine), and turn it into a reward. ""I've gone 4 hours without smoking. I've earned this cigarette"". Do you see how fucking sick that logic is? I haven't poisoned myself for 4 hours, so I have earned this poison. By turning nicotine into a reward, you make quitting so much harder. So my advice is to commit fully, jump in with both feet, and go cold turkey.

4. **Embrace the suffering**. Quitting smoking is like getting in shape. It's going to be temporary discomfort and pain for a better body and lifestyle. Quitting is different for everybody, so I can't tell you exactly what to expect. In general it seems that the withdrawal and cravings peak at around 2 weeks. During this time you are reprogramming yourself. You have to learn to not watch the clock to see when your next smoke break is (I started some new projects at work, started using DuoLingo to try and learn spanish, and picked up my Guitar for the first time in ages). You have to figure out what you need to do to get through a tough craving (Reddit was a big help here honestly. It's such a major time-suck you can pass a craving pretty quickly!). You have to figure out how to beat that anxiety that builds when you don't smoke but want to (relaxation, meditation, or just counting to 10 worked for me). And it's not easy. Your mind will play tricks on you. You will start rationalizing. You will have yourself convinced that just one won't hurt. You will be your own worst enemy. But as long as you expect this, and recognize it when it happens, it is easy to dismiss.

5. **NOPE**. Not One Puff Ever. Several previous quits were sabotaged by ""just one drag"", or ""cloves don't count"", or ""I can celebrate with a cigar"". You have to treat yourself like a hardcore addict (and some would argue that you are). It's a fast road from one puff, to one cig, to a pack a day again. And this is another place where your mind will play tricks on you. You'll be convinced that you've got this under control, that you are strong enough for just one smoke here or there. But you're probably not. Most of us aren't. So why fight that battle? When you start rationalizing, just NOPE the fuck outta' there.

6. **Active Process**. Quitting is not a passive process (i.e. just stop doing it). Most of what I've written above is all stuff that you need to actively decide to do. The first day, if you are a pack a day smoker, you have to actively choose to not smoke those 20 cigarettes. And you have to do that much more than 20 times. You have to actively find ways to defeat the cravings. You have to actively dismiss rationalizing behavior. And over time it does become passive, and you don't think about it all that much. But that's the end game, up front it takes effort.

7. **This too shall pass**. This might just be the most important one. When you first quit it is fucking hard. The first few hours aren't too bad, even though the only thing on your mind is smoking. You might even feel good about it! But after a few hours it catches up to you. Just one final one to say goodbye. Just to help me through this part. Well if one was ok, two isn't that much worse. NO NO NO. You can't give in. And you make it through the first day. Then you wake up the second morning, and it's the first thing on your mind. And you battle all day again, fighting the urge, consciously choosing to not smoke. This goes on for a few days. Then the withdrawal symptoms set in. You feel like shit. You're horking up green shit. You want to die. All the while still battling cravings. And so far each day, each our, each minute feels like it's worse than before. Every instant is the worst instant of your life. But gradually, almost imperceptibly,  the pressure eases. You start feeling a little better. The cravings pass a little faster. They're a little less intense. You can get back to your normal life. The withdrawal symptoms start to fade. You don't get short of breath walking to your car anymore. You have more energy than you used to. The cravings are still there, but now you just have to tell yourself ""NOPE"" and move on. You check your quit smoking app and it tells you how you're saving money already (Why not spend that $50 on a new xbox game as a reward???!!! You've fucking earned it champ!). Your vital signs are returning to normal. Carbon monoxide (That shit can kill you can't it?) levels in your blood are dropping. You check in on /r/stopsmoking and everybody tells you how great you're doing! A few weeks pass. You're in a rhythm now. A few months pass, now you don't even have cravings. It's more of a notion. When you have a thought of smoking, it's no harder to say no to smoking than it is when you wonder ""what if I just said fuck this, quit my job, and move to Tahiti"". The thought is there, but it's easily dismissed. Another couple months pass. Thinking about smoking is not longer a daily thing. Cigarettes actually gross you out now. It's as easy to say no to cigarettes as it is to say no to [krokodil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desomorphine#Krokodil). No matter how bad it gets, no matter how bad the withdrawal symptoms are, no batter how bad the cravings are, you are stronger. You will survive. They will pass.

Quitting smoking is not easy. It's probably one of the hardest fucking things you will ever do. But it is soooooo worth it. I have my life back! I have my lungs back! Since I've kicked smoking I realize that I can do whatever the fuck I want. I've lost weight. I've built muscle. I don't have a 6 pack, but I've got a bit of a line down the center of my abs that I'm super fucking proud of. I've saved enough by not smoking that I could by myself an XBOX One if I wanted. I had to edit this paragraph because I used way too many exclamation points. But I hope my enthusiasm comes through still. I'm a non-smoker! And I want you to be too! You can do it! Quit today!"My friend and I (both smokers) made a bet to see who would give in and smoke the next cigarette....that bet was on dec. 15th 2012.  This is a bet I don't intend to lose."Identify why you want to quit.

Think seriously about why it is time to move on.

Chain smoke until you vomit or are unable to continue smoking.

Discard remaining cigarettes.

Don't smoke anymore.""I tried quitting quite a few times having smoked for six years. Every single time it was an uphill battle and didn't stick. I got really drunk one night and smoked a cigarette and instantly got sicker than I've ever been in my life. That was the last time I smoked a cigarette. The smell just recently stopped bothering me but when I went to smoke I instantly got uncomfortably light headed and haven't really felt the need to have a smoke. It's been about a month and a half without cravings or anything...and even when I think I am craving a cigarette I just chew a piece of gum.

TLDR; vomited my brains out after smoking a cigarette really drunk. haven't had more than two drags of a butt since.""Went home with a guy from a bar, where I'd smoked two or three cigarettes over the course of the night. The next morning, he was visibly put off by the smell of smoke in my hair. He tried to be nice about it, but the damage was done. Seeing him cringe like that and turn away from me was enough. I felt disgusting. Quit cold turkey."Salt on the tip of your tongue. "Like many in the top comments, I also quit cold turkey.  I only ever wanted to quit cold turkey, quitting aids didn't make any sense to me.  They're just as expensive if not more so than cigarettes and you're simply substituting one addiction for another.

There were two aspects to successfully quitting.  The first was a drastic change in my attitude towards smoking, smokers, manufacturers, etc.  The whole system that keeps such a disgusting product on the market and keeps people addicted to a substance that has zero benefit.  I got angry! I forced myself to become irate whenever I crossed paths with a smoker in public, or if I had thoughts about smoking.  I would berate smokers in my head for being so stupid, I would call smoking a weak man's vice, or I would curse cigarette manufacturers, distributors, even the government for profiting.  Basically, I turned cigarettes into a trigger for negative thoughts.  This has stuck with me.

I think the second aspect may have been more important.  I had also become worried about health.  This was tied up with factors other than smoking, like eating properly and getting regular exercise.  Many people would advise you pick one and concentrate on correcting it, but I couldn't fathom eating healthier while continuing to smoke, or exercising regularly while still smoking.  Instead of it being an isolated issue about quitting smoking, it became a lifestyle choice.  

On the evening I quit, I put on some exercise clothes and walked out the door with my pack and lighter in hand.  On my way to a set of outdoor steps I planned on climbing, I placed the half-empty pack and the lighter on the window sill of an apartment block in some misguided effort to brighten some (un)lucky smokers day.  I proceeded to walk up and down the steps until I couldn't, then did it again the next day, and the next.  I combined this with eating simple healthy meals at regular times.  Keeping this up has turned out to be harder than quitting smoking, which in some way has led me to believe that smoking wasn't my primary addiction, food continues to occupy that place of privilege. 

One final key factor in the successfully quitting was not telling anyone I was planning on doing it.  I didn't tell anyone for upwards of two weeks when I finally had no choice because I was attending social gathering.  Don't talk about quitting while you're trying to quit, all it does is remind you of smoking.

These things ACTUALLY WORKED for me.  I had been a smoker for roughly 8 years and desperately wanted to quit before my 30th birthday.  But I should stress that these things worked FOR ME.  I don't think there's a silver bullet, but if you start with the recognition that smoking has become integral to your lifestyle, you will also recognize that in order to quit you should start with your lifestyle.

Hope this helps, even a tiny bit.

**tl;dr** 1) Consider that smoking has become an integral part of your lifestyle.  Think about changing your lifestyle instead of simply quitting cigarettes. 2) Change the way you think about smoking, smokers, manufacturers. Get angry! Get angry when you see someone smoking.  Get angry when you can smell smoke. Get angry when you think about smoking. 3) What worked for another may not necessarily work for you.  There are no silver bullets.""I hope someone sees this - the only thing that worked for me:
1) went cold turkey
2) tried to turn all the emotions I felt about wanting cigs back on cigs - got mad that I was there bitch. 
3) Maybe my most critical change: I promised myself I wouldn't ever try to quit again if I wasn't successful. If I tried and failed, I would accept life as a smoker, and everything that it would entail. I think that mental ""burning of the ships"" so to speak was what pushed me over and helped me quit.

I was on couch too sick to smoke for a week and had a sore throat for a week after that. After two weeks without a smoke, I thought, ""meh. Why not quit"".

The flu helped, but I think I was just ready to quit.""The only way I was able to quit was cold turkey and the understanding that if I did start smoking again that it meant I was weak for letting an inanimate object rule my will power.

You have to understand when the triggers will be, and just work through them.  If you can get through the first two weeks then you are able to get through your entire life.  Eventually, cigarette smoke will be repulsive to you.  You will have cravings for a long while after, but they become lesser and lesser.  ""Chantix. Smoked for about a decade. Didn't necessarily want to quit, but now-wife wanted to and I was sick of getting cravings so I said what the hell. After a week I smoked about half as much as before. Halfway through the second week, I was forcing myself to smoke at all. At the end of the second week, I was done. Haven't smoked in over a year, and really haven't felt like smoking once.  ""I was a smoker for 7 years and have been quit for 12.  The biggest part of my success I feel has been that I resigned myself to the fact, a long time ago, that I was going to have to say ""NO"" to myself for the rest of my life.  I by no means want to be discouraging but it really is a life long battle of willpower.  

Just this year my SO, who still smokes was having a smoke at our front door and I gave him a kiss goodnight before he had completely exhaled.  I had an instant, ""OH MY GOD CIGARRETTES ARE THE BEST THING EVER!"", moment which I then had to talk myself down from (reminding myself why I quit smoking, how much better I feel now, remembering how ill I felt after smoking my first cigarette and that I would probably feel that way again if I had one now).  

It does get easier to do over time though.  I used to have to talk myself down once a week, then once a month, then every few months and it had probably been a couple of years between serious cravings when the last one hit.  Keep on being stubborn internet stranger.  Eventually you'll get there.

He told me that on one particular outing with his friends, they went to the movies and were settling down into their seats and he was having a smoke before the film started (late 60's in Peru if that explains any confusion).

During the series of previews and ads that were coming up, one of them showed a particularly graphic image of lung damage due to excessive smoking. That did the trick, since he then told me how he then proceeded to stamp out his cigarette right there and toss out the rest he had on him.

A lot of it had to do with strong mental willpower from him, even though his habit was relatively young before he kicked it (the habit).

I had been an on/off smoker for a few years before really taking on the habit. Generally, I was up to about 3/4 - 1 pack a day, but then I started working a high-stress job as my first ""professional"" job and we were allowed to smoke in the office (ah, the 90s...).    
    
Due to the environment and the work, I had gotten up to almost 2 packs a day. It was absolutely terrible and I knew I needed to quit. I'd tried a few times before and it never stuck, but I knew it was time. Problem was, I was planning a huge event for our company that was still 2 months away and I knew I would not be able to quit before the event. So I decided that the night of the event would be the last time I ever smoked.   
    
From that point forward, every time I smoked a cigarette or bought a pack, I reminded myself that XX date was it. 20+ times a day, I was telling myself that date was the end.    
    
At the event, I smoked expensive Nat Sherman cigarettes and when the event was over, a friend gave me a cigar. I took 2 puffs, threw it on the ground, stamped it out and never smoked again. I had no cravings, no weight gain, nothing. I was just done.    
    
This was over 20 years ago and I have never had an urge to smoke since. There are times when I forget I was even a smoker and the smell actually makes me sick these days.

I finally was able to quit with a e-go style e-cig to start with. The three things I can say helped me were very simple. The first thing was I went with a heavier nicotine level then the traditional e-cig recommends (blue,green smoke, etc....) that way I was cutting the craving from cigarettes. Second, I didn't get a cigarette flavor. I got sweet flavors like strawberry and grape. (this is also a key because the brand of e-juice you start with makes a big difference, some of them suck). The reason I did that was I wanted my brain to be able to make a quick distinction between the two. Last but not least, I made a concious effort to smoke cigarettes less but didn't force myself to stop. Around five days in cigarettes tasted like shit and I didn't want one anymore.

By easy I mean, well, feel like crap so many days with the fiending compulsion capering about in your head like a drunken monkey, and then it eases off in that finite time period and you're clear. 

Staying quit is the difficult thing for me. I've smoked off and on about 50% of the time over 20 years since the age of 15. Currently non-smoking for about a half year or so. If I ever take a single puff of a cigarette ever I will inevitably resume a full scale habit. So no electronics, no cigars, none of that. I see cigarette smoking in my head as the emotional equivalent of thumb sucking.

I'll give you a composite of all the things that have worked for me. 

1. Being Broke.

The easiest way by far for me is running out of money, going broke. That works. If a cold hard assessment indicates that the chances are very slim to be able to afford even roll-your-owns, I usually just quit. Cost-benefit analysis. The repetitive misery of wanting to smoke and not having any, with the fiending stretched out over months, or a one shot quit bitch clumped into a few days, after which you'll feel much better. I usually always quit at that realization, and let the people around me praise me as if I've been moral and ethical. 

2. Being Sick.

After being broke is being sick. Two weeks of walking pneumonia, pulled stomach muscle from coughing so hard, and in the midst of losing 20 lbs while going through daily 103 fever spikes got your spirits down? If all you want to do is lay down on the couch and disappear anyway, why not just brew plenty of tea for your misery and sleep the fiending away with Nyquil.

I've also found that contemplation of an oncoming flu season has made cigarettes less appealing as well.

3. Being depressed or motivated.

These guys are like mirror image twins. Let's say you feel depressed. Lost your jobs, haven't been in a relationship for years, about to be homeless again, disappointing yourself and your family and everyone you know, effort of last ten years crumbling between your fingers, blah blah blah. Since you're going to be miserable no matter what, why bother smoking? What does a few days of fiending/discomfort matter?* 

And the converse is true as well. Everything is going great, your five and ten year plans are coming to fruition, people respect you, your income is going up, you are well liked everywhere and people want to be around you, blah blah blah. Since you're going to be happy anyway, why bother smoking? What does a few days of fiending/discomfort matter?

* Note, secret depression can occasionally encourage smoking, as a kind of socially acceptable, mildly pleasurable slow suicide.

4. Moral and ethical fiber

I have found this one works more when you have less stress and more free time. I think it worked once or twice in my late teens. ""I quit absolutely cold turkey on August 25, 2011 and haven't went back since, I haven't cheated once....not with a quick puff or an e-cigarette. I smoked for 15 years straight.""I just decided to quit. Something in my brain said ""I'm done"". I went to the store, smoked a last cigarette in front, walked inside and bought the patch. 

Three days later I was hanging out with my buddy and noticed the patch was missing. He said ""that fell off hours ago dude"", so I figured I didn't need the patch anymore. It's been 14 years."http://i.imgur.com/7hvGNcP.png"An E-Cigarette honestly. I had smoked for about 15 years, purchased a decent e-cig online from a friends recommendation...received that on a Thursday and smoked my last cigarette the following Saturday. I haven't touched a cigarette in 3 years. ""Not smoking.  Seriously.  
""I quit by using an e-cigarette and haven't smoked in 355 days, I smoked for 15 years prior to that so it will be a big deal when I get to a year. Out of ~10 smokers in my circle of friends all 5 of us who tried e-cigs have been able to quit. I recommend these 2 websites for the best value http://www.fasttech.com/ or http://www.chinabuye.com/. The small $2 cigarette replica e-cigs are good for the first week because of the tobacco flavour and the visual similarity it tricks your brain, it's so easy that it basically doesn't even feel like you've quit. 

After a week you'll probably prefer e-cigs to analogs and will probably want a more powerful hit and some different flavours. I would recommend then buying an eGo battery, an atomizer and some juice all for about $10 from these websites, you can spend as little as $50 a year and will probably enjoy it more than you currently enjoy tobacco. You can reduce the nicotine content over time and even smoke zero nicotine. E-cigs have generally been proven to be safe apart from the nicotine which is itself slightly bad for you, however getting it from tobacco is 1000x worse.

If you are smart it can be 50x cheaper than cigarettes. You will be able to smoke indoors, on airplanes, around children, you wont smell of smoke, your house and car wont smell. If someone in your house smokes buy them one, if you have loved ones that smoke buy them one and you will literally be buying them extra years of life. Give them it as a present because if you just tell them to buy it themselves they probably wont the same way I'm telling you to buy one and you probably wont. Just buy one, you will be glad you did.""I haven't smoked for years now and I used to smoke a pack a day. What worked for me? I had to *change my habits.* It was pretty drastic. I did not go places where I used to smoke.  I did not go to smokey bars, I stayed away from smoking places because if it was around it, I wanted one. If you take a break at work by stepping outside, just go to the bathroom. Or find another exit that the smokers don't use and make a phone call, play a round of something on your phone, whatever. 

I can't say it was easy. But I did everything I could not to trigger myself. I have now stayed quit far longer than I smoked (7 years) and I am grateful. 

Good luck!""I gave up all smoking and vapor. 

Basically I thought about the concept of promises a lot and the promised a higher power that I would quit. Let's call the higher power ""God."" I basically thought about how horrible it would be to break a promise to God. It even took me a while to promise. I was like ""no way I can't I'll fail."" But I eventually did. 

""Checkmate atheists,"" or something. ""As so many others mentioned, I became a dad and realized it was now selfish for me to smoke. ""Smoked for 8 years. 3 years smoke free now. Did it cold turkey. The only way to stop smoking is to just stop smoking. It was pretty rough for the first few weeks, but once the habit was broken it was easy to stay off. Now I can't stand the smell of the stuff. ""My parents quit after toddler-Bvenged wondered out into the garden, stood still for a few seconds with toys in hand, and asked ""Why do you smoke?"".

They looked at me, then each other, stubbed out their cigarettes and never smoked again.""I just did. No questions, no doubts in my mind. I just stopped. "Saving"The hardest part for me was making the decision to actually stop buying cigarettes. Just the thought caused great anxiety when I was a smoker. I constantly had a pack of cigarettes, and would even buy back ups, many times I would haul ass to a gas station at 3am when I was out, it's a horrible feeling. Today smoking is not the norm. It's viewed by non smokers as a handicap, a gross habit, and that's sort of what it is. If you look at it that way it will be easier to quit. One day I just psyched myself up, told myself I was sick of it, sick of the smell, sick of being the only smoker on a crowd, sick of being the only one out of a crowd that always had my next ""break"" at the back of my mind. I made the decision, and stuck with it. If I failed, I started it all over again. I used patches to quit. Many say it's best to quit cold turkey. That might be true for some, including you, but if you feel you need help there are options available. I do know several people who quit successfully using the ""quit pill"" the name eludes me, sorry. Patches imo are the best, follow the directions and use them correctly. Avoid the gum at all costs, I know people who got just as addicted to it. If you're a ""hand-y"" person like me, get a stress ball or a pen to fiddle with. Avoid gas stations like the plague, pay at the pump when you need gas. I stand testament to this, the last time I slipped up I was at a gas station I frequent and my card didn't swipe correctly, I had to go in. The clerk saw me coming and had a pack of my usual sitting on the counter waiting for me, completely oblivious to the confliction it caused within me. I ended up buying them and that kicked off about a 3 month smoking stint before I finally (and hopefully) quit for good in the summer of last year. "Fuck it. I am done. "National SmokeOut Day. Dont know why, but it worked for me. After 20 years smoking.
""The best piece of advice for me was

""Quitting is easy, it is just a case of not putting a piece of paper in your mouth and setting it on fire."" - Johnny, 2 pints of larger and a packet of crisps.


That was it, when I thought about it I realised how dumb the act of smoking actually was.
I wanted to stop and so I did, cold turkey. There were days I caved and had a cheeky one, but they were few and far between.
""I just decided to stop one day. Sorry that's not helpful at all, but that's the way it happened.""Going on a year smoke-free here. I don't know how much of my experience can carry over to you, but this is what worked for me:

E-cig. If your expecting it to satisfy you anywhere near the level of an actual cigarette, you're wrong. Keep it around if you really really need one. It'll be enough to keep you occupied.

Make a commitment or pact. Obviously, quitting for yourself hasn't been enough, so put in somebody else to raise the stakes. Me and my girlfriend quit together and that was my one element to keep me in check: knowing the guilt I'd feel after smoking a cigarette--that I not only betrayed my trust, but her's. That was just enough motivation to overpower the ""just one"" or ""fuck quitting"" that always pops in your head. 

Don't talk about it. Don't keep track of your days. Just don't smoke. Make it something you simply just don't do. Talking about it keeps it on your mind. The further it is out of your mind, the easier it will be. Plus, after about four months for me, I hated the smell of them (you'll probably notice that as well; they smell completely different), and it wasn't even tempting anymore.

Finally, keep in mind the last time you caved and how much you hated yourself after you smoked that cigarette. And how (potentially) harsh it felt going down. Remember the disproportionate guilt you felt for a minute or two of it. That's good motivation.

I'm always rooting for people who've made the choice to go for quitting. Glad your ready to make the step. GOOD LUCK!"Phase it out. Stopped having smome breaks at work. Stopped smoking in cars. Stopped smoking when sober. Now i may bum one on occassion while drinking if im around other smokers "I switched to chew. The big part for me was the oral fixation so e-cigs didn't work because it wasn't helping the oral part.  Once I got adjusted to chew, I still had cravings but I didn't want to smoke, I just wanted nicotine. Then the nicotine cravings got less and less until I then switching to chewing gum, and eventually I wasn't chewing tobacco any more.  The whole process too about a month and a half. ""my dad read the easy way to stop smoking by allen carr. he hasn't touched a cigarette since. ""fun"" fact, allen carr died of lung cancer.""The simplest thing to do is to find ways around what got you into smoking. For me, it was a friend of a roommate who used to always invite me outside the apartment for a smoke when we were having beers, once I was able to avoid that routine it really helped me avoid the association with having a smoke every time I went outside or every time I had a drink. 

We are creatures of habit and you need to find ways around the psychological connections between smoking and particular habits. This is not guaranteed to work, but can often help you create the base structure of your program of quitting.

As far as your routine, I would say that you should find another way to create an interval within your work day. It could be walking to the water fountain/bathroom more often just to get your legs moving and to create a new habit.""This will likely get buried, but my dad suffered a massive stroke shortly after his 50th birthday. They blamed cigs as the main contributory factor. I decided I didn't want to end up trapped in my own body the same way he was and stopped 3 days later. I used NRT patches for 2 days, forgot to stick one on for day 3 and haven't touched them now in 10 years.

Tl;dr - I had a trigger that made me realise how much I value life over smokes."Tried everything and the only thing that worked was champix or chantix in the USA.  Been smoke free for 5 years now. At least cigarettes anyway :)"I stopped driving to the gas station, parking my car, getting out, crossing the lot, opening the door, walking to the counter, *asking for cigarettes*, pulling out my wallet, and paying for them.

Before I knew it, there were no more cigarettes in my pocket or on my desk or anywhere, and I therefore couldn't smoke any, and therefore have technically quit and been smoke-free since 2009. 

Easy as that. Stop going through the dozen or so steps it takes to get more and pretty soon you'll be an ex-smoker. ""I **actually wanted to quit**.  It's the same way I lost 200lbs. I stopped giving myself excuses and just did it!   It's not even close to easy, but if you're unquestionably honest with yourself, you can do it. ""Getting married to a woman that had no tolerance for it. Hard to hide the smell / bank statements / actual cigarette packs. 

Like, you guys dont understand... Wed have relationship ending fights over this. So she was the best thing that ever worked for me."My kids. I pretty much quit all my other recreational drugs as well. (which I did a lot of) I truly believe my kids saved my life.Same here.  I had a vision of my kids viewing my coffin and being angry with me for being so stupid!The Ego Twist with some Lizard Juice did it for me!"my pop used to smoke 2 packets a day 10 yrs ago, and than he was like coughing every morning he ended up being sick of it, and than just stopped buying cigs. with no assistance at all just will power"Hypochondriasis " I bought a lot of candy to keep myself distracted from cravings... I also used a smoking cessation called welbutrin. It doubles as an amphetamine too so you get increased energy! It took awhile, but once you get thru the first week its easier. Cigarettes start to get that ash taste everyone talks about, smell bad, etc.

Edit: Also, like some people have mentioned, don't give up if you ""cheat"" and have a smoke. Just after that smoke, get back on track again. Try not to let that happen too often, but also don't discourage yourself from it. I had a few smokes after quitting and they just reminded me of how gross it is...  "Cancer of the wallet."I quit working at an establishment that allowed indoor smoking. I also had my friends quit and started dating a handsome man who didn't smoke. I didn't want him to think I stunk. Only real effort I made was to not smoke in my car. I just realized one day I didn't want a cigarette. Going from a pack a day for 4 years to none was hard, until I had the right motivation. Lol screw my health! I just want to be attractive apparently."e-cigarettes and cocaine"Cold turkey.

I tried the gum and lozenges but that's truly the only way. Also separating yourself from the people who smoke for a whole. Creating a whole new routine. Like at work in lunch I would go outside and smoke with friends, I decided to stay in my cube during lunch and go on...reddit. Just getting my mind away from the craving. Anytime I got a craving if tell someone and they'd encourage me to fight through it. I posted a really useful guide in the /r/stopsmoking sub. Check it out!""I chewed nicoteine gum for about a month, worked okay for me. It didn't hurt that I really, *really* wanted to quit. You have to want it.""I found a combination of Chantix and the Alan Carr book worked perfectly. I also did hypnosis years ago and that worked fairly well, but after 4 years I went on vacation and ended up starting again (stupid)."My husband wouldn't kiss me if I had smoked a cigarette. "Exercise.  Ride a bike, do something that pumps adrenalin into your system.""I was a smoker who no one believed would ever quit. I was smoking two packs a day and was just enaged to a girl who hated it. Its now almost 4 years without a cigarette. I still crave it once in a while but than i tell myself if i smoke one...i will go back to smoking full time... (also the feeling of success being cig free is a real powerful boost to my confience whenever i doubt i could anything...)

The  key is understanding the nature of the addiction. You arent addicted to cigarettes you are addicted to the last cigarette you smoked. Right after you smoked it the nictoine rushed out of your system leaving you with an empty feeling...a craving to replenish the nicotine. The enjoyment you get from a cigarette is not pleasure but rather removing the pain of emptiness from the nicotine leaving your system.  All you need to do is reach a point (2 days) of no nicotine and than the battle is purely in your head...

That battle is won by recognizing that cigarettes make your life more stressful not less, you go through airport security last second you burn your clothes people act like you are diseased you rush out of work every break to feed the monster inside you...

This shift of perspective...understanding that each cigarette leads yo the next and that smoking adds stress and doesnt remove it worked for me. 

Its like wearing a really tught shoe and than taking it off... it feels good but only because you caused pain in the first place... it feels better to not wear uncomfortable shoes in the first place and no is crazy enough to wear tiggt shoes just to feel the pleasure of taking them off.

A therapist didnt hurt either :) after all you probably started smoking for a reason and until you attack the root cause, even if you quit smoking you might replace it with another self sabotage behavior...

Pm me an address and ill send you a copy of allan carrs book the easy way to stop smoking. It changed my life. Or you just buy it on amazon if you prefer not sharing your info.""Im a climber and one of my biggest challenges is coming up in 5 months over 19,000 feet. I want to do it without bottled oxygen, so i had a patch on for one day bought an electronic cigarette that was disposable used that for a week and haven't stopped at a gas station other than gas. Today marks 3 weeks no smoking so far so good! ""Smoked for 10 years or so, tried to quit many times. What actually worked in the end was a severe case of food poisoning that had me bedbound for a week so I couldn't smoke. I'm now smoke free since 2009, but still have pretty heavy cravings every once in a while.""I haven't smoked for about two weeks now, maybe three. This is the longest I've gone without smoking for years, so I'm doing good so far.

I've had no major reasons to quit aside from 1) I've lost my singing voice over the past few years and I think myself a singer, so that sucks, 2) I haven't had a good time swallowing or breathing well and I constantly cough of nasty stuff, and 3) some of my friends wanted me to quit. Nothing that I really consider major reasons (I'm not a singer by trade, I can stop coughing stuff up if I slow down, and honestly the worries of others in themselves is never a big motivator to me).

What has worked for me is getting a decent e-cig. What has worked for me in the past, at least better than anything else, is patches. But the important thing is to find a healthy alternative that makes you feel like you're still smoking. If you have a powerful motivator, that helps. Even though I'm technically able to smoke the e-cig inside, I occasionally step outside because it's familiar. I try to make sure it hits as harshly as a cigarette as well since my battery is adjustable.

You have to get a decent one for it to work really well, like nothing you can buy at a CVS or gas station or anything. I got one that was individual parts that I put together myself. With all the parts, charger, and three packs of liquid (each of which last a few days if I'm puffing on it constantly) it ran me about 70 bucks.

That's how I've been able to get by. I don't even want cigarettes anymore. I've had a few since I quit, but they always just leave me feeling crappy and I won't have them anymore. If you don't have a strong motivator to get you through the withdrawals (which are half breaking the addiction and half breaking the habit), then a good substitute for the sensation is what you need. Find something better than smoking. ""No triggers, no methods. Smoked for 20 years (1-2 packs a day), then at some point I realized I no longer want to. Quit cold turkey and never looked back.

Previously tried several times, but never really WANTED to and ended up falling back.
""I quit by stopping, and when the pressure got to high and I was about to freak, I would go have a cigarette, I would push the limit as far as I could. Do something to get your mind off it, have a peice of gum or candy, but when you really can't take it. Have one.  Eventually the time between cigarettes was so high that I was I only smoking 5-6 a day. At that point it was much easier to quit. "I stopped buying them and started bumming them....people eventually started saying no....so I was left with no choice but to quit....it was actually quite easy for me to quit....The prospect of success."I made a choice not to smoke. instead of freaking out that I couldn't smoke I was much more level headed when I realized that it was my choice not to smoke. Took the anxiety and stress out of it. it became no big deal. And I smoked off and on for 20 years. Haven't smoked since 2008, and I never have the urge to go back.""To be perfectly honest... I just stopped. I also had many failed attempts at quitting until one morning I just didn't buy cigarettes. Then came 2, 3, 4... You get the idea. Don't make a big deal of it or even tell anyone; just go about it on your own. You will do it. ""This trick has worked 2 times now.  I quit for a year and a half, then rebooted.  I'm now a month in on quitting a second time.

The week before I quit I told myself that I was going to go 24 hours without a cigarette at the end of the week.  I made sure I understood how terrible it would be and how much it would suck to go through the 24 hours.  After white knuckling it through a day of not smoking and hating every minute, I woke to another day.  I had a choice of smoking, therefore nullifying my previous day suffering, or not smoking and making the pain retain it's value.
I should note I smoked for a total of 15+ years a pack a day.  I LOVE to smoke and not scared to die from cancer.  If I can do it so can you.  
Good Luck ""Stop buying cigarretes. 
That's how I stopped. One day i just stopped. You can't quit if you have cigarretes near.""Just fucking stopping. None if the patches, none of the gum, none of the e cigarettes worked. If you want it bad enough you can do it. It sucks for like 6 months, its one of the hardest things I've ever done. But its been about a year and a half, and I've already saved thousands of dollars.""You know, it may sound weird but for me I decided to quit during the end of a really difficult, awful ""relationship"". In my mind it was: I'm going to do something for ME. Something he can't take away from me. Something that proves how strong I am. 

And it worked. I've been quit for 3 years now and I did it all on my own because I'm stronger than I thought I was.

Edit: Just saw the healthcare part and can empathize - do not leave the building on your lunch break! I know, sounds nightmarish but hang with some nonsmoking colleagues and they'll show you how they wind down without puffing on a cancer stick!""I told myself I'd quit when I was ready. (Smoked from age 13-27).  Finally one day I realized exactly how much money was wasted from smoking.  The fact I didn't enjoy it anymore, and that I wanted to save money for a better life. On August 6th 2012 I just quit.  

Quitting cold turkey is hard. But it's a lot easier than it's made out to be. People describe horror stories, but those people are bitches and drama queens. 

Then the fact that within 6 months my Dad went from being in perfect health (6' 170#'s) to being diagnosed with Single Small Cell Lung Cancer to deceased solidified the fact I made the right choice.  The Doctor's kept telling us that everything in the man was perfect. Liver, kidneys, etc.  But that little cancer was bad and 99% of the population who receive that kind of cancer are smokers. ""I read a book by Allen Carr.  The EasyWay method, or something like that.  Haven't smoked a single puff in 7 years.
Edit:  I am in no way affiliated with the author or company, but here is the book  http://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0615482155""I picked a quit date of 12/21/2012 some four years prior to said date. Stayed up that whole night of 12/20, watched the sun rise and will never smoke again. Pick a date."I promised my girlfriend(we had just started dating and she hated it) I would quit. I also got much more into my personal fitness and decided living healthy was more important than killing myself."I used the gum.  Start by quitting the HABIT of smoking cold-turkey by only chewing the nicotine gum.  Then quit the drug part slowly.  Keep packs of regular gum around and essentially chew gum all day, slowly transitioning from the nicotine to regular.  You'd be surprised how much less you need that nicotine fix when your only way to get it is by chewing with a sore jaw.

Silver lining: very strong jaw muscles."Nicotine gumThe best advice possible? Stop buying cigarettes. Can't smoke em if you don't have em."Not a smoker myself, but my mom was one for a long time. Her method was just replacing cigarettes for big red cinnamon gum. "Attitude is everything.  I have to be in the right mindset or NOTHING will work."For me, I literally just woke up one day and decided not to do it anymore. 

Weeks later I found out I was pregnant. I like to think my body knew right away and told my mind to stop it."Chantix."I quit when my wife got pregnant with our second child. We were both smokers and she told me I had to quit for her to quit.

It sounds really silly, but the way I successfully quit was I stopped telling myself that I was ""trying to quit"" and I simply ""quit"". It's hard to explain but I just made the decision to stop. Every time I had a craving, I just told myself that non-smokers don't smoke cigarettes. Eventually, after about 5-6 weeks, the cravings stopped.

It's just a physical craving. If you just make the conscious decision to stop, you stop. I don't like using the word ""Willpower"" because your willpower can falter. I just was not a smoker anymore, and smokers don't need cigarettes. I can't stand the taste of the damn things now.

One thing that helped a lot actually was this Nintendo DS game I found called ""My Stop Smoking Coach DS"". It taught me a lot of these methods and while the ""game"" itself sucks pretty bad, there is a ton of good information in there that helped.

TL;DR: Don't *try* to quit, **just quit.**""Make it a mental game. Its about willpower. I successfully quit by getting a cheaper brand of smokes, but the goal is to get one with a taste you dislike. Begin smoking those. Each time the taste begins to build up a desire to no longer want the foul sensation. Took me like 2 weeks until i had literally none, but i haven't smoked since May 29, 2013.""Here's the thing, because I was on the same boat as you are (the fifth or so attempt and all) and I realized there are at least three main factors.

It took me a long time, my girlfriend was really upset with me about the whole ordeal (she's a nurse, so she sees the worst of cigarette addictions).  Which brings me to the first factor:  a non-smoking social group.

Our peers have a good effect on our decisions and having someone to hang back with while other people go outside to have a cigarette is a strong defense.

So after getting the fire under me to start quitting, I started to look for the moments when I wanted a cigarette the most.  I realized that I would smoke when I was stressed, when I was working, and in the morning.  It was basically my moment to take a break.

Thus, number 2 is ""track your habits and replace them.""

With that in mind, I would try to replace my habits with better ones.  For example, I started to do exercise in the mornings, I started to little 5 min breaks to reddit at work to rest.

The last step that I had to come to terms with, which actually turned out to be the most imperative, was to ACTUALLY want to quit.   I know this sounds counter-intuitive, but the truth of the matter is that you need to be able to imagine yourself not smoking/refusing to smoke in those situations in which you usually go out to have a smoke.  Taking the time to meditate on this is KEY to finally quitting.

As you might be able to tell, all of these factors bleed into each other, so it helps to make a plan on starting with one or the other.  It is a long process of learning and re-learning, but it is super-rewarding because everything else in your life will fall into place with the change of the smallest habits (and I would say smoking is in the medium to large continuum of habit-sizes).

Good luck! and remember that this is for a BETTER YOU! Get to the point where you don't even THINK about smoking any more, because you don't need it.  It's all a head game, you make your own impasses."[these guys helped a lot](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/)"It's called willpower.

10 years ago, my grandfather was an alcoholic and chain smoker. He used to be a real prick. My mother told him one day while he was drunk at lunch to either stop the drinking or he'd never see us again. 

That day he threw all the cigarettes out of his house and poured all of the alcohol down the drain.

He quit smoking and drinking cold turkey at the same time st 70 years old. If he can do it, the anyone can.

Seriously, the biggest thing stopping you is you. I still smoke and I know why. I have quit before, and started again. At the moment I don't want to quit, mainly because I enjoy smoking at work. I don't smoke cigarettes anywhere but there. I'm allowed a cig break whenever I want, and I only have 2 a day, but I wanna, and so no matter how much I want to quit, there is always a small part of me that still wants to smoke.

I saw a few stories in here before I posted, to do with kids/parents etc. Kids and parents are a huge part of your life, and it doesn't surprise me that these people quit the fastest. Because if you love something that much, it will make you want to quit so you don't have to put them through anything they shouldn't have to go through.""I picked up an ecigarette with no intention of quitting smoking, but I haven't had a cigarette since.

Love the community on /r/electronic_cigarette"Ripped my pack in half like a fucking boss at work one day. never picked up the habit again. that was last june..."I quit a total of 11 times, countless more that ended less than a day after I 'thought' I'd give it a go.

I have not had a cigarette since July 2010. There's no trick to it, no magic cure, you just need to find what works for you and want to quit - I mean really want to quit. To give you an idea, here is a list of things I tried before succeeding:

Patches, 
Gum (normal gum), 
Cold Turkey, 
Nicotine Gum, 
Lozenges, 
Hypnosis, 
Champix - Twice!, 
Chewing/Sucking Tooth Picks, 
Inhalers, 
Herbal alternatives - tea etc (not the other stuff you can smoke), 
and finally Mini Lozenges.

In the end, the mini lozenges and that desire not to give in yet again worked - after several months I started to slow down the lozenges and then slowly replaced them with mints.

Remember also that if you have one cigarette, it's not the end of the world (admittedly it's not great either), but don't quit on quitting then and there. It's a speed bump - perhaps you had that one in-lieu of the other ten you may have smoked that day or 50 odd you may have smoked that week. The trick is to realise that it's a speed bump, move on and continue with trying to give up the gaspers.

Once last thing, I know it sounds terrible and clichÌ©d, but don't think of them as 5 failed attempts at quitting. Instead, you're 5 steps closer to finding what is going to help you quit.

Life smoke free is pretty good, and I have a lot of money (smokes are $$$ in Australia), to spend on other rubbish I don't need but really like!

Good luck!""I took a bit more of a multi-faceted approach...although it was, indeed, cold turkey. I can't give you precise reasons for why this combination of things worked for me but it was a distinct advantage with both the mental and physical adjustment. 
I quit after smoking about a pack a day on most days. It started with writing out a long list of all the reasons I didn't want to smoke anymore and I put it in a place where I had to look at it every day. I immediately upped my water intake. Quit drinking alcohol and coffee for two weeks (they always went hand in hand with my smoking). Took the following daily: licorice root tincture (I found this had helped quitting in the past. eased the internal stress a bit. felt nourishing to the lungs), Cordyceps (mushroom for general health) & Lionsmane (another mushroom, this one for a little help on the brain side of things). Lastly I exercised. A lot. A constant reminder of the damage I had done, the limitations it imposed on my body and a damn good reason to stay quit. Kung Fu and running happened to be my movement of choice. I've been quit for 7 years and counting. Lungs have never been better. ;)

Hope this helps."electronic cigarettes made stopping smoking so easy.My grandmother smoked for a long time in her life. One day she decided to quit and just went for it. When she had the urge she drank water. It was a if factor in her effort to quit."Smoked for 10 years.  Tried to quite a bunch of times.  Quit in two steps.  First I decided I was now a non-smoker.  This is hard, no more smoke breaks and standing outside the bar with the smoker community.  Second, I personally needed to find a way to occupy my hands and my mouth. To keep my hands busy I got a half dollar piece and learned to roll it in my fingers like a mob wise guy or something.  And then to keep my mouth busy I chewed gum....like a lot of gum...like all the time.  To this day I chew gum like a maniac gum chewing freak though. 

My advice: tomorrow you are a non-smoker, that means you don't buy, bum, smoke, take smoke breaks, carry a lighter or swing buy the gas station to pick up anything.  

You can do it!!!

P.S. in about 3 months eat an orange..trust me."reflect on the question whether you want to destroy your body or not. if this leads you to the decision that you want to quit. then do it. don't smoke any cigarettes anymore. don't half ass reduce or whatever. no cigarettes at all. and start enjoying your new breath and all the good things that come with not smoking. "I quit for 3 years, used chantix.  Worked like a charm, stopped after 2 weeks And I was a 15 year smoker. But since e cigs became popular, I started using those.  Go figure lol.....but it's cheaper, no side effects and I still get my nic fix. Need a smoke at work, but it's too cold, too hot, blizzard, rain, hurricane outside?  Bathroom stall works great....""I smoked for 13 years. After nearly coughing up a lung in front my then GF I said "" I need to quit."" I had tried on and off for several years. Her response "" You can say that as much as you want but you know you will never quit and you can't."" I said ""After I finish this pack I'm done."" She replied ""Whatever!"" When the pack was done the next day I decided that I was going to quit cold turkey and no matter how bad I wanted one I wasn't going to smoke. I haven't smoked in four years now. The first month or so was particularly rough. So my motivation was just proving her wrong. I did end up gaining about thirty pounds pretty quickly though.""I was in a bad motorcycle crash and was unable to hold a cigarette until I was ok. it has been 14 years and I have had about 100 bad motorcycles crashes. My mom told me if I quit smoking I would save money. Nope I spent it all on motorcycle parts :)
""Simple: just never give up giving up. Every time you do it, you get a little better at it, and you learn about what causes you to light up again. Remember that cigarettes used to be a good substitute for, or augmentation to many things, so learn to replace those with their original actions, meals, drinks or rituals. You may be depressed, impatient and irritable for a long while after you quit, but those are just more habits to unlearn. I quit late in 2007 on my 9th serious attempt after 15 years of smoking. It is my greatest accomplishment."electronic cigarettes."I never quitted smoking, and alway know that's a possibility. But I haven't been smoking for more than 2 years now. For me, it's not black and white when it come to quitting. And I honestly think it's not that bad to smoke as long as I don't smoke out of habit. For past two years, I started working out and ran a marathon, which made me more sensitive to how my body feels.""After smoking for 25 years, e-cigs worked for me. I did a lot of research before hand and picked a good quality product that would allow me to re-fill my own liquid, and worked like a cigarette (inhale, ""smoke"" is made, no buttons).

I started the e-cigs and quit regular cigarettes the same day. I never looked back. It was a little weird for the first few days, but I never felt like I was having withdraw. I found different parts and pieces to match up so that I had a dependable rig that lasted me all day, and a local liquid distributor.

I gradually, over 3 months, reduced my nicotine level to 0 by mixing 0 nicotine juice with the nicotine containing juice. A couple of weeks after that I just forgot to keep using the vape.

I haven't really missed smoking. I do get an occasional craving, but nothing major. I did have to find some things in my life that have a calming effect though. I used to smoke when I was stressed, now I do other things (pick up my hobby and work on it, rhythmic breathing, meditation).

I also had to stay away from the smoking areas for a few weeks. Though I was in some bars and casinos where there was smoking. In those cases it was helpful to have a vape juice that I really enjoyed and had a good strong throat hit to it.""Chantix worked for me, if you can take being a psycho landmine for anyone around you for a few months. It took away my pleasure in the smoking, so there was no desire to just stand out in the colld with bad breath if im not getting a buzz anymore.

Fair warning Chantix is dangerous, my wifes cousin was the victim in a murder/suicide while her husband was on it.
Some peopel cant take the crazy dreams but i didnt get that, i just got the anger of a someone mainlining steroids and the temperment of a t-1000 with john conner in my sights.

**TL/DR CHANTIX worked for me but everyone around me suffered**""Electronic cig. ego-c upgrade is the model I used. Started with 16mg nicotine juice, lowered to 11mg after 3 months. Lowered to 6mg after 4 more months. Still use it occasionally, especially when I go out drinking. Since Dec 1 2012 I haven't had a single drag of a cigarette. I smoked a little less than a pack a day for about 10 years."Champix. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champix"I know this is totally gonna get buried, but I chewed a whole shitload of gum. Constantly. For me it was keeping my mouth busy.

*beware""I woke up one morning unable to breathe. Had a cold which helped lead to an upper respiratory infection. Went to the ER, 5 hours later I was out. They said no smoking, that was a year ago and I just haven't bothered getting a pack. Never had any urges, just get bored during commercials more. But reddit helps fill that void. ""Cold turkey about a year now. Just kept driving instead of stopping to buy a pack at the gas station. Did the same the next day and the next, until I quit craving then. Just keep driving.""In my personal opinion one of the best ways to quit, is not to quit smoking.
It's to quit buying cigarettes and to stop going out of your way to get one.
If you want a smoke, you MUST ask someone for it.
You must not buy it.

If you have a smoke, it doesn't matter.
Just recommit yourself to quitting and never buy a cigarette.

Nicotine is only in your system for about 2 weeks or so.
After that, the only reason you are smoking is out of habit, it's in your mind.
Remind yourself of this fact when you are over the 2 week mark, which you will be a few times.

I smoked from when I was 9 years old until I was 20, which at the time I was smoking about a pack and a half a day.
I was almost late for work one day and I was out of cigarettes.
I knew that if I was going to buy a pack of cigarettes before work I'd be late and in trouble. (I was late a couple times that week already.)
I was toying with the idea of quitting for a couple months so I said to myself, ""I'm not going to buy a pack of cigarettes. I wonder how long this can last.""
And I made a promise to myself to never buy them again.

Now 11 years later, I've still never bought a smoke.
During the first few months I had a few cigarettes to quell the cravings, but the next day I was a non-smoker again.

Luckily, I don't have cravings for them any more.
I am officially a non-smoker.

I don't know if you've (Reddit) ever been around anyone with lung cancer during their final days.
2 years after I quit my father got lung cancer from smoking all his life.
The sound of someone gargling phlegm and fluid while trying to catch their breath is something that is imprinted in my brain so deeply that it troubles me even to remember it.
I sat next to my father listening to him struggle for days just trying to breathe until the cancer killed him. Until he suffocated.""1.  I was inspired to quit because both my parents quit.  
  
2.  Wellbutrin killed the cravings.""I smoked around 2.5 packs a day for years, the only thing that actually worked is quitting cold turkey, I haven't had a cigarette in 2 years""My husband is Muslim.  Not fanatic, but very devout in his beliefs.  He quit on the plane on the way to going to pilgrimage in Mecca.  I can't imagine the level of willpower to go through an addiction withdrawal as well as dealing with a grueling physical ordeal, but that's what he did. He felt smoking wasn't in line with his other beliefs.
""Late to the party but I quit cold Turkey. I had been thinking about quitting for a while, I hated the smell it left on me, hated hiding it from family and my kids, hated the taste it left in my mouth and the money it took from my pocket. 

I woke up one day and said I'm done. I won't give them any more money, I won't smell like an ashtray and lastly I want to be there when my kids have children of their own. When I finally made the decision to quit it was easy after that. The hardest part is truly wanting to quit. If it's half hearted it won't work.""I smoked weed. Weed rules and it's easy to quit. If I could go through an entire day without smoking a cigarette, I awarded myself with a joint at night. Like a hobo once told me; why smoke if it doesn't get you high? Now I haven't touched either in many years.""I went to a wedding recently and all my cousins, aunts, uncles etc were there and they said that I looked like shit my eyes had bags and my skin looked gross and i smelled...haven't touched a cig since and I feel/look great.

But that isn't what helped me stop.  Having a motivator is what helped me.  In my case, it was having kids.  I didn't want to smoke around them and that provided me enough incentive to quit.

No chantix no gum no patch.  Set a date a month or two in the future and let someone supportive know about the date.  Before the quit date slow down slowly on the amount you smoke each day.  So for the few days before your date you only have 2 per day on the day before make sure you only have one and on the final day have your last one ceremoniously and crush your last pack and remaining smokes in your hand before discarding the pack.  Avoid drinking and bars for a month after you quit.  Never smoke cigars too.  My name is anon and I am a nicoholic."2 Years tobacco free here.  A couple things helped me.

First off I had a friend that quit cold turkey, and the ""if he can do it, so can I"" spirit of competition really helped me. Try to find a quitting buddy if possible.

The second, and perhaps most important thing, was gum. Many smokers have an oral fixation, and having something to chew on was super helpful for the first two months (it gets easier after that, and the gum wasn't as necessary).

But not just any gum: I'd go to the gas station and I'd buy every flavor of gum that looked okay.  Every time I'd have a craving for a smoke I'd open a new pack of gum and try something different.

This was key, *having a new experience.* Whether or not I liked the new gum or not, my body was like ""Hey this is new, lets devote some brainpower and catalog this new experience"".

Within minutes of chewing the new piece of gum, the craving for nicotine would be a fraction of what it was originally.  Hope this helps!""My 8th attempt worked, but it's gross.  I smoked quite heavily and would occasionally spit up a bit of black stuff.  I coughed it into my hand once and had a moment of incredible shame as I saw what I was doing to myself.  From that day forward every time I had one of those thick coughs I would always spit it into my hand and take time to look at it and know what I was spending all of my money on.  That was 8 years ago.""Stopped smoking April 1st, 2012.  Couldn't afford to both smoke and pay rent/eat anymore.  Also, I HATED smoking cigarettes.  Also, smoked weed when I absolutely HAD to have a smoke.  Got my smoking sensation with real smoke, with a buzz that followed, but it wasn't nicotine.

This had to have been at least my 50th attempt.  For perspective, I was 22, and smoked 1 pack to 1.5 packs/day.

When it comes to work:  Fresh Air breaks.  Or hell, just get up and go walk around.  There's no such thing as ""only getting a break to smoke.""  If anyone says anything to you, tell them kindly to fuck off because that's a bullshit double standard and it is an illegal reason to terminate an employee.""ANSWER = You have to want to quit.  Sounds obvious but most people are not ready.  You have to want to quit.  NO one will convience you to stop. Only you can make that descsion. When you do, it will be ruff. But you will do it. "Cold turkey.. Nothing else worked for me"I moved to a new town. That is, i moved out of a city and into a small town. Breaking the habit patterns and starting hanging out with people who enjoyed physical activities made quitting really easy. Also climbing one of the many peaks around here made me realize i had to quit if i wanted to enjoy mountain hiking. I still occationally have a sigarette at a party, but i don't have cravings the next day. This was after 8 years of steady smoking (5-15 a day) and three earlier attempts at quitting.
""I think it was nicotine poisoning ...

I'd been averaging a pack a day for a little over 10 years. Then I went to a Schick quit-smoking center, back in the 80's, and they had me smoke a bunch of cigarettes at once, almost hyperventilating on them, with my head in the rising cloud of smoke from the ashtray. (And while snapping a rubber band on my wrist with each puff.) I started sweating profusely, heart racing,, got nauseous, stomach cramps, blurred vision, etc ... laid in their lobby for a half hour, then drove very slowly home. Got up the next morning with no desire to smoke, and haven't had tobacco since - no interest.

Don't have any aversion to smoke (except, stale cigs smell crappy just like they did when I was a smoker).""I quit cold turkey after twenty years of heavy smoking. I picked a quit date weeks in advance and finished my last smoke at 4:00 AM the night before. 
Nicorette inhalers helped the first month and I kept one in my purse for years for ""emergencies"" (too many beers with smoking friends, high-stress situations, etc.).
I honestly believe (even eight years later) that ONE PUFF might be enough to send me back to my two-packs-a-day habit. I was an addict. I can't have just one cigarette. Once I accepted this fact about myself it got much easier to resist temptation.""We are learning about the respiratory system right now in PA school and had a whole lecture on smoking cessation.  Don't be afraid to see your doctor and get some help.  It's said nicotine is just as addicting as heroin so doing it on your own can be tough.  One strategy we were told that works is counting out your sigs for the day and putting them in a separate container and that is all you get for the day.  The next day ration yourself 1 less and so on.  By the time you get low you will start to question each time you light up and try to stretch them out.  Eventually you will only have a few a day and then none.  Also the medication Chantix is suppose to be really helpful.  But you have to be careful it has some interesting side effects like weird dreams, mood changes ect.  Quitting is one of the best choices you can make for your health.  It's crazy how many problems smoking causes besides lung problems.""I was never a heavy smoker - 2/day or so, more when I drank. Thing is, I love smoking and drinking. Still do. So, quitting while sober was easy - it was learning to enjoy a nice beer buzz and *not* smoke, which, IME, makes you drink more and hangovers worse. So, I quit drinking entirely for 4 weeks. Then, had a beer. Then 2, just to break the association. For me, I've never said ""I'm *never* going to smoke again."" In fact, the pack is where it always stayed - I *can* smoke anytime, I just... don't.

Breaking the tie between drinking and smoking was key. Instead of smoking, I'll stand outside with people, drink more water, smoke greenery, play a video game, or any other thing that breaks the association. Might have a smoke on Superbowl. Might not. Either way, I'm confident that I can now smoke a few times a year and not have it be a thing. "Swedish Snus.I started to feel pain in my lungs after taking a deep breath.

Get the generic ones because they seem to work pretty well and significantly less than name brand. Follow the system; 21mg for 4 weeks, 14 mg for 2 weeks and 7 mg for 2 weeks. The hardest times for me were when i had to step down in patch sizes. Keep telling yourself that you want to quit. The e-cigs work to give you the physical satisfaction. I used to always smoke as soon as i would hop in the car, so anything where you're used to grabbing one as a reflex, keep the e-cig handy. Also start patches at the end of a pack and do not buy a new one. You may crave out and ask a buddy for one but just don't make it a habit and don't let it lead to buying a new pack. And finally keep telling yourself that it's making you better. . More productive at work, you can taste better, smell better, your car no longer stinks, etc. I am on my last 10 patches of 7 mg and it's been working. ""I smoked regularly for about 15 years.  Quit a few times and went back during that period.  I'd smoke when I was nervous, smoke when trying to write, smoke as a reward for getting writing done, smoke to kill time when i arrived somewhere early.  It was a huge crutch.

In the end, I wasn't even trying to quit.  I was trying to save money by switching to e-cigs.  ($12+ for a pack of smokes in NYC.)  My first e-cig was an over-the-counter thing I bought at 7-11.  I quickly got a proper personal-vaper online, and started vaping like a mad man.

Then a weird thing happened.  I just started to need it less and less.  To the point where I'd go weeks without taking one pull of it.  I still vape a bit, mostly in social situations.  I've also bummed a regular smoke, just for old times' sake -- and it was strangely unappealing.

So I find myself an accidental ex-smoker because of these things.

I recommend getting yourself a proper e-cig online.  The proper implement and juice combination can make a world of difference."Don't tell a single sole you stopped smoking.

Then I started to recreationally smoke cannabis, and after that could not smoke cigarettes again. Every time I would light up a cigarette, I could acutely taste how bad it is and that it's not giving me a good feeling at all.  I don't know why this worked for me, and I'm not advocating anything, but I haven't smoked for 4 years now, and most importantly, the feeling inside of me- that I want to smoke when I am driving, or at other specific trigger times has vanished.""For me, it was a girl I really cared about. I was 25/26 and we were struggling in our relationship, but I wanted to do EVERYTHING I could to make myself a better/more attractive person to her in an effort to save our relationship.

I was a half-pack/day or more kind of smoker, so, not as intense as some others, but I still struggled with quitting. I had tried to quit maybe 7 or so other times in my life. Sometimes I'd go up to 6 months without a cig, but I'd always come back to 'em eventually.

Anyways, I really didn't want to lose this girl, so I quit smoking for the 8th time in my life. We didn't end up staying together, (we're still friends), but that was the last time I smoked.

After ""quitting for her"", I really liked the way my breath, clothes, and car no longer reeked of cigarette smoke. I also enjoyed feeling healthier and, conveniently, I quit right before the cost of cigs spiked up significantly.

Its been 10 years for me, so here are some tips:

First you have to **want** to quit.  

Next, you have to learn to disassociate your activities from smoking (waking up, eating, sex, driving, work breaks etc...) These activities can no longer be your trigger to smoke.  

Throw out your ashtrays - don't just empty them.

But most important: You have to **stop identifying yourself as a smoker**.  

Think of things you aren't, and add ""being a smoker"" to that list.  
For example:  Are you a sea captain?  Are you a tight-rope walker? Are you a porn fluffer? Do you clean chimneys?  

Your immediate ""No"" answer to these kinds of questions will help you develop the same state of mind that you need to stop identifying yourself as a smoker.  Once you can immediately answer ""No"" to ""Are you a smoker?"", and confidently state that you do not smoke, you know you have achieved the state of mind to be successful.   This was the key to my quitting and staying a non-smoker for 10 years.


tl;dr: Quitting is easy, ""staying quit"" is hard. You have a much better chance of maintaining if you disassociate your identity of being a ""smoker"".

I used to live in a dojo and could not keep affording my own habit so one day a visiting acupuncturist comes by offering their services for free to anyone on the property. I thought I was gonna be poked and prodded everywhere. When I finally got it done, it was only three needles, one over my heart and on on each arm. I was told to keep the needles in for three days and whenever I got a craving just rub on one of the needles and it actually tricks your craving into believing it got what it wanted. The actual effects of this lasted for just a few weeks. The real secret is, and I'm sure hundreds of people in this thread have said it already: you have to Really Want to quit, I had many reasons to quit but first and foremost reason: because I wanted to."Just smoke marijuana instead "I got to a point where I'd be smoking 2 packs of cigarettes over 3 days.  
I didn't enjoy the cigarettes anymore so I decided I'd quit. I went a few days here and there without smoking or just smoking a few, but never *really* ""quit"", and always ended up buying another pack.  
I realized I just enjoyed smoking, but found it wasn't limited to tobacco.  
This is where cannabis came in very handy.  
I was smoking bud then too and had a one-hitter and a box that really helped me finally put a stop to the cigarettes. Any time I had the urge to light up a cig I'd just pack my hitter and usually smoked just one, but allowed as many as I thought I needed. Yes this was probably inefficient and costly, but it worked and after a few weeks, and a considerably less number of cigarettes, I put an end to my addiction once and for all. I fought fire with fire, quite literally.  
I may be very accustomed to smoking weed, but I can put it down for weeks at a time and come back with no issues, which is the opposite of how it was with tobacco.  
From time to time, though very seldom, I'll enjoy a full-flavor cigarette, but I look at friends who keep up their old habits and know for a fact that I'll never be in their position again- and that's the best part about having quit smoking cigarettes.""My problem with that is after I put the joint out, I always reached for a cigarette.  ALWAYS.  
""One thing that helped me was I threw away a pack I had while it was still a little over half full...I kept telling myself, ""Oh, I'll finish up this pack and be done with it!"" and I would always buy more. Finally, just tossed away a nearly full pack that I had had about 5-7 smokes from already and just said, ""I'm really done with it."" That was it. Just the mental breakthrough of not wanting to finish a pack. I have to admit I struggled for a bit, but it only took about a couple of weeks and then cravings weren't so bad. I honestly don't think it was that difficult at all. But for people who have been chain smoking for years and years and *years*, I could understand why it would be harder for them. I think I was like chain smoking for 4 years before I quit (about 2 years ago). ""I quit smoking weed for months at a time. But that quit turned into a break because i started up again. Concentrates all day. 

Moral of the story


I fvckin love to smoke weeed. ""Got bronchitis twice in one winter. Then again in the spring... that time taking a drag felt like inhaling knives. So, I quit.""I started to imagine that each drag of the cigarette was making my life shorter, each billow of smoke was a toxic poison (And technically it is, every 15 cigarettes apparently cause a minor genetic malfunction). The cigarette turned into an hourglass that was ticking the time by, and it started to freak me out. Then one day I just up and left. Like many have said, cold turkey is the answer. I went through crazy withdrawal symptoms though, I developed insomnia, irritability, I even would shake in my bed for hours before I went to sleep. It was a traumatizing experience but I can honestly say I feel better than I've ever felt in my life. A life without smoking is the best possible life you can live."Chantix "It was actually a [Radio Lab podcast on inspiration](http://www.radiolab.org/story/117165-help/) that did a bit on smokers midway through. I had quit several times--lasting from a few months to half a year. Complacency always killed me. ""Oh, I'll just have one."" No you won't. 

Armed with an idea from the podcast, I took everything I hated about smoking and focused on it intensely. Then I had a conversation with my future self. My future self of every single moment I would ever exist. I waged war on cigarettes. A never ending war, until the day I die. Because that's what it will be. 

It gets easier to not want one. The cravings subside. But, the complacency will always be there. The idea that I can have just one pops up once every year or two and then I hear myself. I hear that conversation I had. This is my war. And I'm going to win god damnit.""Currently quit smoking for about 6 months. What worked was patience. Not expecting to be able to quit right away.

I got the e-cig so that i would not smoke at work, instead i would use the e-cig. I did this for a couple of months, not caring when i smoked on the weekend. Don't beat yourself up over it, it makes quitting harder.

Then after doing this for a few months i found that i needed the e-cig less and less. Then i just stopped all-together.

""It came down to a woman, she wouldn't kiss me or want to be around me really when I smoked. It started by me not smoking when I knew I was going to be around her, or when I was around her. As I started to see her more, I started to smoke less. Eventually I was not smoking more days than I was smoking, finally I just decided I didn't need it anymore. Having something to make it worth quitting for I believe is the easiest way. "Just deciding to quit and did it.  Didn't half ass it and give up"Drugs. Champix to be specific. My wife and I were burning through more than $500 a month and sleeping at night was a cacaphony of wheezes pops whistles and screels. Dying people make very similiar sounds. We just kept trying different ways to quit. Side effects crom Champix are real btw. I had some dreams that only LSD could have matched and the support site is truly crap. Nevertheless, we soldiered on and are still cigarette free. I still enjoy a good jib every now and then with no inclination to have a smoke. Inhaling produces some amazing reactions though. Just remember this. Smokers have rights too.""Illness. 

I had a little cold and I just couldn't take smoking any longer. This is the longest I've gone without smoking since I started at age 11. (Over a year.) SO glad I quit. More savings! More breathe! More smell good!

""I smoked for over 20 years, tried everything. Chantix worked. It's been 1.5 years""This thread: ""If you wanna quit smoking, create a crib-midget immediately.""""My now wife said she wouldn't date a smoker.  Quit the next day, almost six years later I can't imagine smoking again.""I honestly just got sick of it. My friends got me into it and I liked it for a while. Then I went on vacation with them. We were all pretty young so we did it to look cool (they're still in denial). We were in FL from MI and wanted to look sophisticated or whatever. But the whole time we were there they wouldn't stop smoking. Chain smokers I tell you. When I was smoking they were, and when I wasn't smoking they were. So much smoke both second hand and first hand, I finally got fed up. I hate the smell and the taste. I had a cigarette the other day because I was really frustrated. Gave me a migraine. I couldn't see or hear anything with out my head pounding. So the good news is I kicked the habit and my body won't let me do it again. I smoked for four years and quit 3 years ago.""Everyone quits for their own reasons.  If you know why you want to quit, keep that thought to hand at all times.  Remind yourself constantly of the thing that made you fight so when your body thirsts you can tell it to wait and wait again.    

Talk to your pharmacist about nicotine replacement products.  What worked for me may not work for you.  I do recommend treating yourself to really nice comfort food for awhile though. 

Good luck in your fight.  ""I married a non-smoker, so I quit so I didn't smell/taste like smoke""Chewing tobacco. I quit smoking 3 or 4 times and I finally curbed the habit by switching to smokeless tobacco. While my lungs feel better, it's generally not a good idea to switch to an alternative tobacco source without the intent to titre your nicotine intake down, with say, a vape pen. If you're gonna quit, quit cold turkey and ride out the storm. Also, don't have a single cigarette after you quit, or you'll end up like I did going back to smoking for a few more times.""I smoked paul malls and heavy american spirits until i couldn't smoke anymore. Also, it was too hot to smoke where i lived.

Keep in mind, I was a chain smoker for 3 years and loved smoking, but knew i had to quit. It took 9 months to gradually decrease my habit to 0. Now, I've almost gone 2 years without a cig.

You can do it. Stay strong.""What helped me stop after 17 years was that I made myself hate smoking. The smell on my hands, the taste, heartburn and the wheezing. I attributed it all with negative connotations, some of those were easier to connect. Also I made myself quit smoking in certain places like work and in the car. When it started getting cold again and my friend quit a couple weeks prior, that turned out to be the tipping point. I felt if that bastard can do it so can I. So I picked my date 11/11/11, quit cold turkey and never looked back. It's been 2 years plus and I've probably never made a better decision in my life. It feels so good to be free of that smelly, smokey, carcinogenic prison. I hope something I said can inspire and help any of you. ""For me it wasn't that hard just got an ecig the ones where u put the oil stuff in the top and it vaporizes it, and havent had a cig in two months. I guess my inspiration is simple i dont want smoking to be the shit that kills me when I'm older. I know it sounds kinda brutal and I know something will one day but it's not gonna be from my own actions.""I used the patch for a couple weeks and I chewed nicotine gum briefly after that, but it came down to willpower and mindset. I smoked 2 packs a day for almost 30 years (I started age age 11). I tried many times to quit, but I just couldn't do it. One day I woke up, hacking and gagging as usual, and decided I'd had enough, and I was quitting. The difference was that, unlike previous attempts, this time I *knew* that I'd never smoke another cigarette. I was absolutely confident. I hated smoking more than I hated withdrawal.

That was 11 years ago this month.""I ended up in the ER with a perforated ulcer (after months of stomach problems).  They first went in laproscopically, noticed the ulcer looked abnormal, cut me wide open, took a slice of my stomach and rerouted my plumbing abit.  Was in the hospital 7 days, and often thought about trying to get out the door for a quick smoke.  Home for 4 days, and back in the ER due to ""leakage"".  In the hospital another 17 days after surgery to repair said leakage.  Then 8 days in PT.  
After 36 days with no nicotine, I was ready to run with it.  
  
Was not a conscious effort on my part, but outside forces forced me into it and I am NOT going back to it.  
  
Good Luck!!!!  
""Pretty impossible to stop smoking if you have cigarettes around, so stop going places where you can buy them. If you're not physically in front of someone, wallet in hand, who will sell you cigarettes, it's easier to just not buy them.

Pretty hard for people who have cars and need to go to gas stations, I suppose, but whenever I want to quit (I'm and on again/off again kinda smoker) I just steer clear of convenience stores and gas stations, get people to pick things up for me.

Quitting is not that hard if you don't have cigarettes, so just organise your life so that you aren't able to get them.""Society. I moved to the UK where its a very blue collared activity. Hardly anyone from work smoked. Few people would go out and smoke with you outside the pub. Just reduced gradually and then finally one day, I could quit at will.

The fear of cancer as I grew older helped as well.

"Chantix"Motor cycle accident. After coming out of the ICU, I asked the doctor to wheel me outside for a smoke. He advised the large hole in my lung left by a broken rib puncturing it probably meant I should quit. ""Girlfriend didnt tolerate it from the very beginning of us meeting. I already had it in mind to quit but didnt have the willpower. This help me kick the habit and ive had a handul of cigarettes since (in over a year), but havent started up the habit again. Chemical reaction from new relationship overrode the addictions grip on my brain..""I tried every pill, patch, and placebo. The only thing that worked was one day I smoked way to too much and got that nauseous feeling. I locked that memory inside and brought it up every time I wanted to smoke and every time I did smoke. The habit had to become disgusting on some level or I couldn't have done it. I had to be repulsed by the sight and smell to the point where I couldn't help but quit."Ex smoker of marijuana. It became legal in my state so of course my life dictates that I have to stop smoking it. A big trigger to get back on the horse is seeing people use the E-Cig.I just stopped. I'm a cold ass turkey."I had phenomena and spent several days in the hospital. After six or so days without a cigarette I figured since I had gone without one for that long there was no reason I could not go longer so I made up my mind right then and there to never smoke another one. This coming May sixteenth, twenty fourteen will be my fourth year without them and I will never look back. Cold turkey was the best way and worked for me. I began smoking in nineteen seventy.""Having a kid, and being as impressionable as they are, would always make me feel horrible for lighting up.  When my daughter learned about substance abuse in kindergarten, she would always tell me ""that's bad for you daddy.  My teacher says it can kill you.""  Having always been a superman in her life, I couldn't stand her knowing that kryptonite existed and that it could mean that one day I wouldn't be a part of her world.  This revelation resulted in me quitting cold turkey.""I just quit. Didn't go buy a pack, didn't go around smokers that I could bum one from. No one at home smoked and I just avoided being in a situation where I had a chance. About a month or so later, it just did not matter anymore. I smoked for 15 years and I have been quit for 15 now."Cold turkey. "I was tired of smelling gross, getting yellow fingers etc. I just decided to say ""fuck it, I'm done"". I literally dumped out my pack of smokes and took a piss on them. I think the key is to substitute the habit of goin for a smoke with something. For me, everytime i wanted one i forced myself to go and get and drink a large glass of water.  When i smoked i liked having a break. So getting water, i would get that break and the water suppressed my urge to smoke. I did not use and nicotine pills or anything. Give it a try, its cheap and simple... not easy tho. good luck.""Hardest thing I've ever done. Learned the hard way:

Three weeks of moment-by-moment sheer determination and distracting yourself by whatever means available and you'll have broken the back of it.

Ten years of steely resolve knowing full-well that even one toke starts it all over again, during which time you'll have bad dreams of slipping.

By year 20 the thoughts will have faded and you'll find the thought of smoking repulsive.

You'll never regret quitting.""Quitting cold turkey.  I dared myself to see how long I could go without smoking and didn't let up.  My mind set was that if a big part of my family could fight in the second world war, or that most of the world grows up in poverty, then I could quit a minor addiction.  You have to just tough it out and deal with it.

I would like to point out a few challenges you may face quitting smoking:

* Constipation.  Cigarettes make you shit, so many people get constipated when they quit.  Eat lots of fibre.
* Alcohol.  I went the first month without drinking because I knew I would light up if I did.  You many have to choose to do something that keeps you aways from bars.
* Caffeine.  Just like booze they go together, but this is daily.  You are already going to be on edge from not smoking, so caffeine would make it worse.
* Social.  You have to quit hanging out with the smokers outside on break and start hanging out with the walkers.

One more thing.  What helped me a lot of was cutting back and smoking lighter cigarettes for a month first.  I had tried to quite other times and failed, and when I did this first it made the cravings less serious the time I finally did quit.
""you must learn to hate... hate them more than anything. just keep thinking about everything you hate about them, it works. i quit cold turkey about a year ago and a couple times ive bummed them, couldnt even get through them and i can honestly say i hate cigarettes now.
oh and just a heads up, youll never get over it. youll always have that emptiness thats never going to be filled up every time you see somebody smoking, even though i hate them and even smoking wont fill that void any more, its still there and it always will be. so just sack up, you fucked up, so did the rest of us, now its time to accept the consequences""You have to really want to. Cold turkey worked best for me. If I had even one a day I would never stop. I just needed to quit nicotine. No patches, gum, or e cigs. I felt like those were just stringing me along. However, I ate A LOT of wintergreen lifesavers.""what worked for me is explained in [this comment on this very thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1wjy5y/exsmokers_of_reddit_what_actually_worked_to_get/cf2nt0l)

Find a way to relax that doesn't involve standing around outside with people that are smoking, maybe keep walking around the block, or go somewhere else like a cafeteria. If smoking is the way you deal with stress and anxiety look into relaxation techniques so you can handle it yourself instead of using tobacco as a crutch.""Cold turkey.  I quite coffee and alcohol at the same time (for 3 months) because every time I drank coffee or had a beer(s) I had to have a cig.  During the day i supplemented it with raw red peppers and raw broccoli and hummus.  The crunchy crisp feel helped me through the cravings during the day.  I also started exercising first thing in the morning, so that the night before I could tell myself that I needed my breath to exercise, so that helped my cravings at night. 
""I met a bunch of my old friends (6 years back) that I used to compete with alot (for pride not money) and they beat the shit out of me in every self weight/propultion excersise we tried.

Dont know if it was solely due to smoking, but since then I have lived much healthier.

Try to think this way, would 12 year old you be proud of your life choices if he saw you today? If the answer is no then just change whatever behaviour/context is the source and/or contributing to that answer. 

Might not be the most realistic choices, but you will atleast be a happy man.""Started smoking weed, now can't handle cigarettes without feeling like I'm going to throw up. Same applies to snus. "I used nicotine lozenges. I had never attempted to quit smoking before but decided to give myself the chance to try. The first couple of weeks were hard and I had to avoid smokers and smoking triggers as much as possible. I've had moments of weakness but what's helped me stay away recently is my dad having lung cancer. He had to quit cold turkey while in the hospital and I just can't smoke knowing what he's gone through.My friend said that seeing the lungs of a smoker in an autopsy made everyone in the room quit smoking for life. "I quit 3 times.  The third time was permanent.  I don't really know what worked.  I just mentally decided I had had enough.  I ended quitting but still smoking when I was in a bar or strip club.

I think I finally stopped smoking while out, because I couldn't take how absolutely shitty I felt the morning after.  I used to wake up and cough and gag so bad, that I couldn't take it.  A couple of times the post nasal drip was so bad at making me gag, I actually got sick.  I was useless to my wife and kids for a good hour after I woke up on Saturday morning, because I was out at some strip club with my friends and had smoked a whole pack of Camel Lights between 10:00 PM and 1:00 AM.  It was literally like a smoker's hangover, when you binge smoke only on occasion.

Now I don't even think about it any more.  I get disgusted just by the smell of cigarettes."Anybody else wish they sold rots in packs of two? I enjoy smoking every once in a while but I end up throwing out most of my pack :l"I convinced myself that I was not a smoker, nor had I ever had a cigarette before. Havent had a smoke in 8 years since that day. ""Every time you want to have a cigarette, don't.

You're sitting at your computer, ""I'm gonna have a cigarette."" Don't. You're at work, you need a break. You go outside with the rest of the smokers, you're about to smoke a cigarette...Don't. Just don't. The same way you don't go into incoming traffic or jump of a building.

Not doing something is way easier than doing something.""Started smoking back when the earth's crust was still cooling, in 1976 at the age of 13. Was smoking 40-50 Camels a day when I quit in 1990.  I quit because I no longer wanted to make profit for some corporation at the expense of my health.

I did this:

Starting in week one, push back the time when you have your first smoke by two hours. Each following week, do this, delaying your first smoke of the day by two hours. 

So week one, say first smoke 8 am. Week two, 10 am. Week three, noon. Etc. After that you get to smoke your lung out.

This worked for me as it allowed me to gain willpower, incrementally, throughout the day, one hurdle at a time. First, the hardest was to get over having my first coffee w/o a smoke. Then the am break at work. Then lunch, etc.

YMMV, but this is a good idea for many people whom for whatever reason can't do cold turkey.""Sex.  My now wife said 'You can either smoke or you can kiss me.""  That was the last cigarette I ever had.  I never looked back.  :)""/r/electronic_cigarette
""Gradually slowing down to the point where having one didn't even taste good anymore. Although many others that I know who have quit couldn't do that.  Most of them just went cold turkey after years of smoking whilst really wanted to quit and hating themselves for it.  We are all also in our 20s, and I've noticed it's much easier to quit at this age than 10 or 20 years from now."My uncle always likes to tell us the story of how he quit. He ran out of rolling tobacco one night and couldn't be bothered to walk all the way to the 24/7 super market to buy more. Never smoked again."My Grandad who had smoked up to 60 a day had a stroke at the age of (about) 70. This stroke was ironic in the fact it made him forget he smoked, and never smoked a cigarette from then on. Alas the damage was too far gone and he died not that long after. ""I forced myself onto e-cigs only and after a couple months I preferred them to real cigs. I stayed on my e-cig for about 15 months or so, slowly dialing down the nicotine dose, and I kept telling myself I would soon quit, but I kept putting it off or finding justifications to waiting a bit longer (ie. it would be a waste to not finish this bottle I bought, oh no, my battery isnt working so well, I should replace it so I can finish off these carts and so on). I finally realized I wasn't going to just slowly quit one day so I took all my e-cig stuff and tossed it in a random dumpster at work one day.

That was about 7 months ago and I've been nicotine free since. I have cravings sometimes still but they happen less and less often. I try to do something healthy instead when they do happen, like running.

Edit: I smoked about 1.5 packs a day for the majority of the last 18 years.""My wife and I were both smokers, and she had a health scare and had to give up. I quit cold turkey with her as a show of solidarity. Love was my motivator, I guess.""e cigs worked for me. still addicted to nicotine, but no more smoke.""I was a chain smoker when a friend of mine called an 800 number and proceeded to quit.

""Probably will get buried but there's a great program my friend turned me onto called quittxt. It's still a research program run by a university.  When you sign up they give you a quit date 2 weeks later and send you messages about quitting smoking up until then. Was really helpful in staying motivated. They do follow ups as well. They even send you gift cards for completing surveys about their program and letting them know how you're doing. I would highly suggest checking it out
"Getting married... "I smoked for 20 years and had come to terms with the fact that I would smoke the test of my life. I simply could not see myself quitting. I LOVED it too much and was too resourceful at making excuses or tricking myself into""just this last one"".

I had even stopped 1 full year 7 months once,  but again I fell.

UNTIL. ...

 I understood one thing about myself: Everytime I quit I was an EX-smoker: I was counting the days since my last smoke.  I was preparing myself to not smoke if I got drunk or during holidays. I was not a NON smoker.  Non smokers aren't afraid that if someone smokes they'll smoke. They aren't afraid to get drunk and smoke. No. They do not smoke, they never will. 

Soooo. I chose a date. Bought some nicotine patches in case things were extreme and decided ""in my head"" to become a NON smoker instead of an EX smoker. 

That. .. was over 3 years ago. Haven't counted :)

One thing tho: until today I still remember loving to smoke and that I could perform MUCH better at work (software developer). But what I have gained (family time, example for my kids, sports) surpasses by far what was left behind. 

TL; RL: I had to adjust my attitude to think as a NON smoker instead of thinking as an EX smoker. nicotine patches helped during the cuttoff but the attitude kept it going. "There was a recent Radio lab segment called [You vs You](http://www.radiolab.org/story/117291-you-v-you/) that explains how my way quitting worked. I replaced the urge with a consequence I felt was greater made sure someone would hold me to this promise/consequence and then I just couldn't do it- I couldn't smoke anymore.  I also rewarded myself for each week I made. I was a nurse for 15 years by the time I quit I smoked more than a carton a week. I've quit as of Valentine's day 13 years now. Each year we have a Bacon Party to celebrate. Good luck.  The key is find what behavior or thing you find even more repulsive or upsetting and have friend help you with this promise.  What was the consequence?Buy a nice premium e-cig like the blu and get some delicious flavors that you enjoy. The goal here is to transfer the addiction to the e-cigs and then decrease nicotine amount in the cartridges until it's just flavor. This worked for me and I gave my blu to my friend.What worked for me is I just stopped buying my own cigarettes and had friends and random people around my college campus I would bum from when I was jonesing. I hate bumming cigarettes and that actually really added to my drive to stop entirely eventually. Quitting cold turkey is really hard and I don't recommend it."What kind of ecigarette do you have?

Admittedly, I started because I had a pretty bad cough and thought that smoking wasn't gonna help. I took it a day at a time, and after the cough finally let up, I said fuck it, maybe I can actually commit to this.

The cravings ended about four or five days after I quit. Sometimes when I get drunk, a cigarette sounds super appealing, but I haven't given in and I don't plan to!""Ecigs, but not the gas station kind.

I had been smoking for 9 years and stopped cold turkey after listening to the book and never think about it anymore. "I quit in 2009"So, this goes against the cold turkey thing, but I had to kind of phase myself out of it. I had tried cold turkey several times, but the idea of ""never ever again"" was way too intimidating for me. So first, I stopped buying cigarettes, and after that occasionally I would bum one if I was around a friend who was smoking. If I was drinking, etc... Then I made a rule for myself - only if I'm out drinking. Then after about a month or two of that, I felt like such a dick for always bumming one cigarette while drinking, that I cut back. Several months went by, and I had one while drinking, but it tasted so bad, and I was so disappointed with myself, that it just made me realize I was done for good. I was never a big smoker (1/2 a pack a day at the very worst), and I've only truly been off for a little while now, but it worked for me. I think you just have to make goals for yourself and stick to them. And like everyone said, you have to want to quit.""My young daughter came home from a weekend visit with her father and new girlfriend, told me they were going to quit smoking together. So...not to be left out I quit. 6 months later, they are still smoking and I have never felt better! Yay!""Because I was ready to let go.  I know that sounds hokey and all, but its true.

Plus, it really helps when you feel like you're going to crawl out of your skin from withdrawals.""Moved to another country which totally distanced me from all my habits and triggers. Break your routine, do something else when you'd normally light up.""The Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Allen Carr!!! It worked for me, my mom who had smoked for 35+ years, and dozens of my friends!!
I heard Ashton Kutcher (of all people) talk about it on Leno. Ellen Degeneres also quit with it.

And the best part: YOU CAN SMOKE WHILE YOU READ IT. 
But when you finish the book, you will no longer want to smoke. It takes away the desire.""I tried at least 10 times over several years before I finally quit for good. Two things really helped:

1)I stopped lying to myself after I made it 30 days or so and thought ""it's ok to have just one. I'm out with the guys, having a beer, but I made it 30 days so one won't hurt."". This got me every time. It's always ""just one"" that gets you hooked again. You have to say it's 100%, without a doubt, NEVER AGAIN. 

2) Change of life-style, priorities. I started running, which lead to hanging out with other runners, which lead to thinking more about what I put in my body and caring about my health. It doesn't have to be running though. You could start cooking and learning how to make healthy alternatives to different foods. Or any other sport or weight training that gets you into the right mindset to care about what you're doing to your body. ""I don't get why people must go to such great lengths in order to quit. I used smokeless tobacco/dip since I was 12. Dip takes nicotine to another level when compared to cigarettes. I would constantly always have a chew in, every day, for eight whole years. Yeah I was addicted. But guess what, three weeks ago I got tired of the shit, dumped out my can, and haven't chewed since. There's no need for books or moral support, you just need to support yourself. If you can't do that then you stand no chance in this world, and you'll be stuck where you've been your entire life.""Focus on all the positives and remove ABSOLUTELY everything in your life that promotes the habit. Friends smoke? don't see them. Drinking is your weakest moment? Don't drink for a couple weeks at least. After dinner stomach isn't settling and your dying for a smoke? Eat less, smaller meals. 

It took me a couple times but I haven't gone back. Every day is a battle. ""Chantix.

Over three years without a cigarette.  I am around them all the time too.  No cravings at all.""I just decided to quit, and so I quit. It was surprisingly easy. Sometimes I have an urge, but if I wait just 1 minute, it's gone. I think quitting bad habits is often times, for many people, not that hard. I realize some folks are addicts, but the media and general consensus overplay how hard it may be to quit a bad habit (for some people)."The patch for  6 weeks then just will power.

My cravings are gone. It took a couple weeks, because I was on vacation, but eventually I quit. Been like 3-4 weeks now although I'm an ass and will smoke a few on the weekend if I'm partying. "I have asthma but decided to smoke any way when i turned 18 and was having a rough time. it got me work breaks that id never had before. After eight years and it all caught up to me when i went to the ER and they told me i had bronchitis and pneumonia so i was hospitalized for a week. My heart rate was a big deal and they were worried about sending me home. When i got out i started eating jolly ranchers a lot to help my cravings i then switched to Altoids. I also smoked a lot of pot so i kinda substituted that in but never felt addicted to it. I am now tobacco free cept for the occasional lighting of a pipe."I'm 1 year clean cold turkey. What worked for me was making a big deal about quitting to my friends who smoke as well. I turned it into a matter of pride and that worked for me. 

Also, buying an ounce of Mexican ditch weed for $45 and rolling a bunch of joints doesn't hurt either."I picked a date and just quit.  My date was about six weeks out. Slowly worked down to one to two smokes a day and when I ran out on that day I just stopped.  Coming up on two years now and I've never felt better "I cut out every association I had with smoking -- going to liquor stores, drinking copious amounts of alcohol, and going outside with my friends for the occasional break. In reality the only thing that helped (for me) was cutting out ciggs at the source. Telling myself they were too expensive, the cough wasn't worth it, and my gf didn't want to kiss me with that nasty ass breath also helped ... you gotta find your own motivation :/ it's so hard""In all honesty, cold turkey and love. I started when I got married and tried to stop when I got divorced. I tried gum, didn't work. I would just have a cigarette after the gum. Tried patches, didn't work. I'd take a patch off then have cig. Ultimately I met my current partner. I was madly in love with her, she hated smoking and that was the only ultimatum she has ever given me. It took three weeks for the really bad cravings and bad temper to die down. After about two months everything was peachy. I still fancy a smoke every now and then but I don't give in. The down side was that I gained about 60 pounds at the time.""I quit after 16 years, I tried many different methods but the one that finally worked for me was Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking. It approaches the problem from the mental / brainwashing side.  I have been tobacco free for 2 1/2 years. ""15ish year smoker here, teens to early 30's.

First I had to actually want to quit smoking, sincerely.  

Then, Quest brand cigarettes (which it looks like they've discontinued??  sorry!).  They were a step-down cigarette essentially, strengths 1, 2 and 3, with the middle one being comparable to the Parliaments I smoked at the time.  The lightest one was like smoking air, only .05g tar I believe, compared to the .5g or so of the previous.  

The whole process took a few months for me, but in the end it was ""embarrassingly easy,"" which is what the friend said to me when he suggested it, he'd quit the same way.  

I've always felt it was like the reverse of the nicotine patch where you quit the physical habit and then the chemical one.  With Quest I quit the chemical habit first, and went through all the withdrawal issues but I could still smoke my brains out!  Then after a month or more of smoking air, which was more exhausting than it was worth, I got to the ""why bother"" stage and dropped it.  I chewed a plastic toothpick for a few days while driving, after meals, etc., but at that point it was just breaking routines without the additional monkey on my back.

I don't know if there are comparable brands out there, Quest tasted terrible but did the trick for me.  Good luck!""barbiesarthitis, it sounds like your job is tense and/or stressful and maybe taking breaks is needed. Maybe if you timed how long it takes to smoke a cigarette during one of your breaks and took the break without smoking that might help you take a needed break but without the coffin stick? 

What worked for me was taking a promise. I would take a promise during the day that I wouldn't smoke for 10 minutes and over a period of weeks made that promise incrementally longer, up to a day. I allowed myself to smoke after the promised time finished and I usually felt quite sick because my body had begun to detox. The main idea was to build up the power of the promise, so once I'd taken it I felt under the power of keeping my word to myself. From 1 day to a week, to a month. So I didn't make a promise I couldn't keep. This helped me to create some distance between myself and the addiction, until I was strong enough to make the promise for a year.

I was on the web many years ago and came across this site that helped me reinforce my promise. It's called [Bullets For My Beast](https://rational.org/index.php?id=59), scroll down to the bottom of the page for [the beginning](https://rational.org/index.php?id=155)."Look up pictures of lung cancer...that's what got me to quit after pack and a half a day for 6 yearsI had a great girlfriend who told me she would have sex with me every time I was craving. "I smoked for about 14 years until I finally looked down at the pack and saw the surgeon general's warning on there telling me that they are bad for my health.

That and all those artsy fartsy anti-smoking commercials.

I actually used chantix to quit.""Thinking about my own mortality. I am adopted, but I recently found my birth parents, my mother is a smoker and she still smokes. My father was not a smoker, but he passed away one week before I could meet him in real life due to a heart attack. Patches also helped, but gave me weird lucid dreams. ""Just quit. Cold turkey ftw
""Nurse here. Former smoker (smoked off and on for about ten years). 

I took two weeks off of work, stayed ridiculously busy with PLANNED activities including a trip. Made it thru the two weeks cold turkey and when I got back to work, I'd say I was going for a smoke break and if walk to the vending machine for peanut M&Ms and walk the halls for 10 minutes. ""I started smoking when I was 14. The day of my 19th birthday, I woke up and couldn't breathe. I stood up hyper-ventilating for about 20 minutes before I could finally breathe again. I then proceeded to cough black shit upfor over an hour and told myself this is the day. I'm done, no more. I broke all my remaining cigarettes and flushed them and have been happily smoke free for 3 years now. ""Sports it was for me. 
I wanted to compete in a Triathlon so i started training for that. I felt the effect on my lungs immediately when i smoked a little bit more so i completely stopped. The Triathlon was just way more important for me. 

And it made it even easier because after a long bike or run session the body is full of endorphines - it feels so good, no need to destroy this with a smoke. 
Ive quit 2.5 Years ago now, sometimes when im at a party and a little tipsy i smoke one or two and always feel bad the next day because of the terrible feeling in the mouth. ""I quit a pack-a-day twenty year habit by running. I ran myself to exhaustion. I started setting goals for races to keep me focused. Races are fun. I tried to do one a month. After about THREE MONTHS of wanting one every day, I just didn't anymore. My last day smoking was December 19, 2009.

I've run 323 miles this month in a virtual race called [Janathon](http://www.janathon.com) I'm currently in first place as ""fiftystatebanana"". My kids are no longer sickened by my smokey clothes and stinky car. I feel great. I ran a marathon in a snowstorm on Saturday. I'm never going to start back with the cigarettes.

My message is: find something to occupy your time, something that's only dependent on you, something that provides you with both a challenge and a positive result. Paint, crochet, raise dogs, build a treehouse, whatever. And if you crave a cigarette, tell yourself to shut the fuck up and [insert awesome experience].""I bought an E-cig. Once you get one you like, you can easily stop real cigarettes. Sure, it's not really ""quitting"" I suppose, but that works for me because I still enjoy the act of smoking. And smoking delicious flavors like blueberry lemonade make it very enjoyable."My mother told me she simply stopped smoking. She hasn't smoked in 25-30 years by my estimations."Three years ago I quit, and I quit cold turkey.  I wish I had other tips to tell ya but that was it.  

The big thing for me was smoking with my roommate was a social thing; I asked her to keep inviting me out to talk/chat with her.  I didn't feel excluded and also didn't feel like I needed to smoke in order to hang out with her.  ""I had been in an abusive relationship for a while.  She didn't give a shit about my feelings on anything, physically abused me, took all my extra money, made me feel horrible about myself.  It was a really dark time in my life that I'm ashamed to have lived.  Once I finally broke up with her I had this amazing sense of freedom.  I was able to live my own way again.  Every once in a while she would call me and try to get back together, but I wasn't having it.  Every once in a while I would remember some of the rare good times and think about her, but I knew that she was an awful, horrible bitch that I never wanted to see again.

One day I finally made the connection... smoking was an another abusive relationship for me.  It made me stink, made me feel bad about myself, kept me out of fun social situations, ""physically abused"" me by hurting my health, cost me approximately $18k USD over the course of ten years... and for what?  What did I have to show for it?  Nothing!  I was no further along in life by being a smoker than if I was a non smoker.  So I ""broke up"" with cigarettes.  Wrote a break up letter and everything.  And again I felt a remarkable sense of freedom.  Every once in a while, cigs would ""call"" me (withdrawal pang).  Every once in a while, I would remember a good time I had while smoking and think about it, but I knew that it was a horrible addiction I could easily live without.  And at that point, quitting was easy.

When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.""I went to a Komen walk in NYC and saw thousands of people wearing blazing pink shirts and hats, laughing and walking together to fight cancer. More than a few were obviously battling cancer themselves, and as I jogged along in this crowd of pink, I just thought, ""I'm literally asking to get cancer by smoking."" I'd tried to quit for two years, and I really felt like I would never be able to do it. So I said a prayer and asked for help. I walked the rest of the 5K and another 8 miles home, over the Brooklyn Bridge. It finally stuck.
Still, I could have one cigarette today (5.5 years later) and become a regular smoker again. I loved it only slightly less than I hated it.""Chantix works well if you don't have depressant tendencies. You can smoke the first week, then after that you're pretty much done. I took it for a month and haven't smoked in a year. The desire to smoke is long gone as well.""18 year smoker reporting in. Had to post my experience. I was able to quit once using chantix for 4 years. I don't know how. I lit up on a float trip BOOM all went to hell in a handbasket. Now I'm 11 months since my last smoke. Vaping! I vape and I have a quit partner, I found her online at quitnet.com. A solid quit partner, we just email, she's in a different time zone, and vaping have saved my life! I was like you, I've tried it all, ALL multiple times, other than that I don't know what to tell you other than hang in there, don't quit quitting! One of them will eventually stick! HANG IN THERE!"" I think what finally did it for me was spite. I did it so I could look at husband and say ""I quit. Your move."" ""I used chantix to quit. But I didn't follow the pick your quit date then start taking 7 days before. If you read the instructions they talk about you can keep smoking for up to 8  to 28 days (I can't remember the length) then that to me just took the pressure off of me so adventually I just lost the desire to keep smoking when i realize it wasn't doing anything for me..

Also Jolly Ranchers and Tootsie Pops are the greatest!"Honestly it was because my insurance was going to go up a grand a year.  Quit cold turkey haven't had one since.I woke up one morning almost two years ago and for some reason started thinking about the connection between cigarette corporations and the government. I came to the conclusion that I didn't want to contribute to these types of  corporations and their influence on the government's decisions. I quit cold turkey that day on principle. "First, you have to WANT to quit.  Sounds obvious, but I know I tried quitting a number of times because I should, not because I wanted to, and every time I started back up.  Once I got to the point where I didn't want a cigarette anymore, it was just a matter of willpower.  I just decided I was going to be stronger than the craving.  It's all about attitude.  Don't let the cigarette beat you.  You're stronger than it is!""I stopped buying them...

The trigger was running a mile and almost dying. I wrestled in high school and would run ~50 miles a week.""jolly ranchers 
""E-cigs here. the first time I tried one, I knew that this could actually be the thing that finally helps me to quit. I bought a Blu starter kit and never smoked another analog cig again. Next month will be 2 years going smoke-free.""I got sick and couldn't smoke for a few days. Figured this was my best chance, found ways to redirect myself, carrots when at home, mints when at work. Didn't take breaks because it would just make me want one. It was hard ay first but the craving starts to fade. It never truly goes away, 5 years later I still crave one from time to time. ""My great uncle smoked two packs a day for 40+ years, got told by a doctor he had throat cancer and needed to stop if he wanted to live any longer.  He quit completely the next day.  Dude is a bad mother fucker.""My wife quit a few weeks after finding out she was pregnant.  Took her that long to ween down.  I, however, took alot longer.  I tried several types of e-cigarettes that got me to cut down a bit but not for long.  Finally, doctor prescribed be Chantix.  A week later and I haven't smoked for over a year.  I still want one almost every day, but the thought of my son keeps me from touching one. "You have to start hating it. Everyone has a different way. But quit the morning you wake up and really hate it. I realized how much smoking made me stink. So I quit cold turkey 23 years ago. I picked it back up briefly when I was in the military and bored. "I did a backwards-ass method with an e-cig.  Rather than weening myself down off nicotine like most people, I moved up to the extra-high nicotine juice.  It was so harsh and terrible that I used it less and eventually stopped.  Haven't smoked or used it since then.  I also exercise and eat better and in general live more healthily, which helps deter me from smoking as well."Becoming a father... shit suddenly got real."i was put on wellbutrin for depression/anxiety (but it's also used for smoking cessation). i wasn't necessarily looking to quit smoking, but i began to not crave or even want them anymore. "I have heard about this book by alex carr (I think) that is really good "Eating 2-3 oranges every day for about a week really helped control my cravings when they were at their worst. In fact, they essentially became non-existent. My friend who is way into accupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine gave me this tip. But staying away from drinking for about a month was also a big part as well.""Hypnosis.  I know it sounds hokey, but I tried everything to quit and nothing worked.  I didn't think I could be hypnotized.  I literally thought about smoking a cigarette the WHOLE time I was under.  Came out, threw away the pack I had and I was done.  I didn't smoke for 6 years.  Fell off the wagon with a ""it's been long enough, I can have just one"" lie (ex-smokers, don't fall for that!  1 = right back to where you were!!).  Got hypnosis again, and am back to not missing it.""I just had to stop buying them. That is the key for me; if I have them in my pocket I will smoke them all day and night. If I don't, the most I can smoke is one or two that I bum from someone.
""Ecigs, definitely consider them. No more tar and carcinogens, great flavors, save money.""electronic cigarette.

sure it's similar.. but I haven't had the health bullshit of real cigs.

I guess it's like a whore switching from sucking dicks to sucking on dildos.""Spite, and nicorette gum, and yo yos. 

Mostly spite though, My first wife had horrible bronchitis, yet she still smoked. She kept saying that she couldn't quit because I smoked too, and she would want one. yet she told the doctors that she didn't smoke, ""but my husband does"" which of course made me look like a dick. So finally I said, fine, we'll both quit. I went out and bought a pack of nicorette, way back before they came out with other flavors and such. she bought a pack of juicy fruit and told me smugly that that was all she needed. She never quit. So that was a big motivation right there, just to show her that I was a much stronger person than she was. 

THe nicorette helped a lot though, I don't think I could have made it through the first day without it. But you have to stick with a schedule. I think they say you should chew 12 pieces a day at first, at regular intervals. and then work your way down. So I did that for the first few weeks, but you also don't chew it like normal gum, you chew it a bit and then put it between your lip and gum like you would with a dip. after a few weeks I worked my way down to 9 pieces a day, and then I would pop in an extra one if I had a craving, this gave me something active I could do if I had a problem, after a bit longer I was able to start chewing normal gum instead of the nicorette gum on every third piece, then every other piece. then I didn't need it any more. 

The triggers were harder, driving was hard. I started playing with a yo yo to keep my hands busy when I wanted to smoke. I got pretty good with it, So the combination of really wanting to quit(the spite) tapering off the nicotine levels, (the gum) and finding some other habit to keep my hands busy( the yo yo) worked. ""I used to smoke 2 packs a day. This was naturally very expensive, and so to combat this while getting my fixe, I switched to rolling my own cigarettes. This is what really made me quit. 

The fact that the tobacco was so much stronger without the filter, that after 3 consecutive cigarettes my lips would start stinging. Also, just rolling them takes a bit of time, and requires a bit of thought before hand versus just automatically lighting up. It made me ask myself; ""Do I REALLY want to smoke one right now? "" This gradually weaned me off the addiction of shoving smoke after smoke in my mouth. After a while it became more introspective: ""Why do I want to smoke right now?""
After months, I eventually just started smoking for the flavour of tobacco, which I just really enjoy, and now I occasionally smoke a cigarette a couple times a month. 
It might sound strange, but it worked for me. I guess if you really stop the automatism of sparking up a drag and maybe slow yourself down to ask yourself why you want to enjoy that cigarette, it becomes easier to stop. One cigarette at a time.

I never binge smoke, and a pack lasts me almost a year (if I didn't keep losing it), and that's just ok in my opinion, because I do it because I want to enjoy the flavour and not because I need to. Like a fine scotch.

TL;DR Roll your own. ""This may get buried but hopefully you'll see it OP.  Right off the bat, I am an ex-smoker.  I stopped all forms of nicotine addiction on June 14th of 2013.  Also, I failed many times before that.  Many, many times. 

The first thing you need to do is not shame yourself for failing to quit this time.  Most people believe that shaming a smoker is necessary.  Their logic is that if they give the smoker enough shit he or she will feel pain and that this pain will be a motivator to quit.  This is society's approach.  So, when we fail we do the same thing.  ""I'm a piece of shit.  I'll never be able to do it.  I'm weak-willed."" etc.

The problem with shaming is (I'm a therapist by the way) it does nothing but perpetuate ""shameful"" behavior.  I won't go into details in this post, but it is a well studied and researched phenomenon.  Shaming someone (whether they do it, or someone else does it) just leads to ""Fuck it, I'm a failure, I'll always be a failure.  Might as well have a smoke.""  Don't buy that shit.  You failed.  Failure is an event, it's not a person.  You are not a failure.

With that said I'll offer that you need to have a reason.  Likely you already do have a reason, but also likely you are very good at avoiding thinking about it.  For me, the key was dwelling on the reason and never letting yourself off the hook.  I'm not saying shame yourself.  I'm saying, don't let the nicotine receptors in your brain sell you (the real, non-addicted you) a line of bullshit.   Hold yourself accountable to that reason.  You're likely going to still smoke even though you're holding yourself accountable to your reason for stopping.  You'll feel like mentally berating and shaming yourself.  Don't.  Just say, okay, I fucked up, moving on.  

In case you're wondering.  My reason ended up being something I never thought it would be.  I always thought it would have something to do with my kids (i.e. live to see my grand kids.  Walk my daughter down the aisle etc.)  It turned out that I could no longer look heroin addicts in the face and try to help them out of their addictions when, at the same time, I was jonesing to run outside and smoke a cigarette.  I felt disingenuous and fraudulent.   How can I ask my clients to face their addiction when I couldn't face mine?  Is that genuine?  Dwelling on that thought, without falling into ""you're a fraudulent piece of shit....what a hypocrite"" self-shaming was my mental key.  

In the physical realm, I was never able to stop smoking tobacco cold turkey.  I was able to switch to e-cigarettes.  I smoked an e-cigarette for about three years.  At the end of three years I was just so sick of being addicted to anything at all.  I was tired of limiting my life (movies, travel, etc) by having to feed the beast constantly.  I loved e-cigs, and more power to anyone who feels like they have no reason to quit those.  But for me, there was a form of mental slavery that I was just unwilling to live with the rest of my life.

So one day I just stopped.  I just gave myself permission to be a dick, to eat as much as I wanted, to indulge in other ways, but not that way.  I prepared my wife and my family.  

It sucked.  It did not feel good.  It felt like a combination of having the flu and being pissed off.  My wife was very understanding and supportive.  I packed on 30lbs.  

But I quit.  I have my life back.  No fucking addiction controls me anymore.  And I dropped the weight.  I feel great.  I love life without cigarettes.  I will never give anything like that control over my life again.

Well, maybe tea.  I really love tea. And cheese.  Cheese too :)

Cheers mate.  I wish you best and no matter what I know you can do it.  

tl;dr

1) No shaming
2) Have a reason and dwell on that reason
3) Switch to e-cigs (Not saying it's for everyone but it worked for me)
4) After a while stop e-cigs and give yourself permission to indulge in other activities (eating etc.) without shame while you quit"Chest pains!!!

One more or less right after i started, it was of course not very good not having been into sports before. 1 year later huge improvement. I started smoking shortly after that.

That was it. I quit then and there.

True, I'm still addicted to this thing, but there's no risk of cancer, copd, emphysema or any other nasty shit like that. ""In Canada, cigarette packs have those big warnings that all smokers ignore (or ask for a different pack when they get the rotten teeth ones). One of those warnings got me, it was a quote from a anger patient saying that breathing feels like inhaling through a straw. I tried breathing through a straw, not easy!!! Then I got flash forward of how my life would be if I continue: carrying oxygen tanks around, being a burden to my family, etc etc.

I switched to black and milds; they don't hit as hard as real cigarettes but you still get the physical satisfaction of smoking.   I tried e-cigarettes too, but they just leave a lot to be desired.  The black and milds are big, so I'd light up, take a few puffs, then put it out and save it for next time.  (Kind of rachet, I know.)


After like two weeks of smoking them the cravings were a lot easier to bear and I just stopped and sucked it up until they went away.  It's been two months now.  I hope this helps you out, personally I feel way better without them and you will too."[deleted]" Chantix. Love it hate, tried killing yourself on it? I dont care worked great for me and I love having awesome dreams everynight. I quit after 15 years of smoking, haven't smoked in 4 years. Worth every penny I paid. Didn't finish the medicine gave the rest to my best friend and he stopped smokeing. That was a 2 years ago. ""I went cold turkey, but I did start again after my room mates and I got robbed and I was the only in the house during the whole thing. I quit again after that summer the same way and was good for about a year or so and I have since kinda started on and off again due to stress. I think the best way to do it is going cold turkey. This last pack I bought will be my last though. "Pregnancy. It's not for everyone though. "I tried quitting four times before it stuck... (10 months and going strong)

My approach was a little unorthodox, I guess.

I got two packs of Marlb Reds (I'd been smoking ultra lights for a month or so in preparation) and a 750ml of jim beam.

I consumed all the whiskey and smoked both packs of cigs-- refusing to sleep until I was done and feeling sufficiently awful.

I woke up feeling like the worst piece of shit imaginable. I didn't even WANT a cig for two or three days afterward. It helped jumpstart the quitting price, especially because the first four days are supposedly the worst.

Another aspect of it was mindset... I've tried not to treat them like an absolute taboo, but, instead, a guilty pleasure to be very wary of.

If I smoke one while drinking socially, i'll note the date and say ""Okay, that was fun, but now not another until X amount of time has passed.

I've smoked probably four since I quit and, in increasing fashion, have found them less and less satisfying.

Also, nicotine gum.""I'm 24 and I started smoking when I was 12. I was a pack-a-day smoker (or more) since 2009.

I just quit one day. Cold turkey. I locked myself in my bedroom for three days, only coming out to eat and use the restroom. On day 4 I started hanging out with my smoker friends again, but my cravings were much easier to deal with. My triggers are drinking, being around other smokers, having one right after I eat, and with a cup of black coffee first thing in the morning.

I've been smoke-free for 5 months now.

Go check out /r/stopsmoking""The Patch, the Pill and refusing to give up.""honestly, just a strong will/can do attitude

i didn't start smoking until i was 18 and in college... i had a few cigarettes/cigars and smoked quite a bit of pot before then but i wasn't a 'smoker' of cigs until college

by the time i was ~25 it was 2 packs a day... my gf (of about 2 years at this time or so) hated it... and so eventually i decided fuck it i'll quit!

it was really really hard, and after about a week i broke down and had a smoke, and you know what? it was disgusting! once you get unused to the smoke, it really is gross

so cold turkey i quit -- but it didn't last forever... about 4 years later, we came into some hard times and were having a lot of difficulties, i ended up picking up smoking again... got right back up 1 pack a day, the disgusting taste was overcome by having a light menthol cigarette, i had never even tried a menthol before but it was smooth and got me right back on them

smoked for about 8 months there and my gf (same gf...) was just really really pissed about it so i ended up just quitting cold turkey again

that was 4 years ago now""I reduced my smoking after getting married to a woman who didn't like it.

I reduced it more after having children, and I didn't want them to see it.

It helps a great deal that almost no one smokes at my workplace, to the point where I'd be embarrassed to smoke in front of my coworkers.

It helped that at some point, I realized I didn't enjoy the actual act of smoking anymore, even though I craved it when I wasn't.

Also, alcohol is the devil in a bottle when it comes to smoking.  Never drink when you're in a situation where you'll be tempted to smoke.  You'll crack.

It was a 10 year process for me of reducing/quitting/failing/reducing/quitting many times, but I haven't had one in over 10 years now.
""Well my mum died a slow painful death from lung cancer, so that made me quit. I also got pregnant quite soon after so I had even more reason not to carry on. ""This may sound weird, but religion. I stopped cold turkey."Dip..."My father: ""I was stinky all the time, couldn't taste anything, and they were all so expensive.  Then I got throat cancer, and that *really* did it.""

Two years cancer free, 2.5 years cigarette free.""I was in Michigan for work, and I'm not a huge fan of American smokes. Well I got a stomach virus and that was sort of that. 

I didn't really like the American smokes so I was smoking less, then the stomach thing and I stopped. 

The American smokes on their own would probably might have been enough to be honest. "My wife made me."The way in which I stopped smoking was by manipulating my own brain. Let me explain : I had tried before to stop smoking but it did not work. Every time, I found it so hard to look at my last cigarette and think ""This is it... last one..."". I was also thinking of future events in which I was looking forward to participate and thought of how hard it would be to not smoke at these moments... I was asking myself how I could stop smoking without having to go through that hard goodbye moment. I found a way around.

I would tell to my brain that I am not quitting smoking, but only buying packs. I could smoke whenever I wanted, but I would just stop buying packs. If I wanted to smoke, I had to go beg for cigarettes outside. That way, I convinced myself that I was not quitting. I could smoke socially all the time, it's easy to get people to give you cigarettes and in the meantime, I would smoke less and less...

To this day, I still smoke only on occasions. It worked. I am healthy and from time to time I smoke a cigarette when out with friends or things like that. In a way, I tricked my brain into thinking that I am not quitting. ""I haven't smoked in close to 7 years now. The two primary reasons for me were:

1) I was moving in with my now wife and her son and wanted a clean start
2) I made a promise to myself that if I even sensed a negative impact from smoking I would drop it immediately. This turned out to be a bout of heavy breathing after doing some heavy work renovating the house we were moving into.

Basically that day when we moved in as a family into our home I quit cold turkey and just sucked it up and worked through the after effects ( headaches, etc ) 

Best decision ever !""It was a combination of factors. 

My willpower, Chantix, heart palpitations, watching my grandmother die from emphysema, and my father was diagnosed with cancer.

I can only say that once you quit, NEVER smoke again, not even once.  That was how I quit and stayed quit."Chantix. You can still smoke while you start the medication. It was pretty amazing how I just lost the desire to light up. It just....went away. I was able to quit that first month. I was sleeping with a girl who ended up becoming my girlfriend. She told me she didn't like that I smoked and she wouldn't bang me if I kept smoking. I quit immediately."Champix made it really easy, and trippy dreams were a nice side effect."The price of cigarettes."SWIM used LSD. The next day they no longer desired to smoke, and haven't since. ""I stoppes gradually. First I stopped taking smoke break at work because nobody was anymore. Then I only smoked at home at night. Then only when I was going out having a drink. 

Then, I decided I was ready to quite for good and I did. Haven't smoked for years now and I don't miss it one bit !""At the age of 64, I gave up forever. My doctor and I thought a mass attack using patches, inhaler, and lozenges might work. I went through the patches quickly and quit smoking almost immeadiately. I asked for the next step on my patch prescription, but the pharmacy said I had to use the strong ones for 6 weeks. I just got angry and quit all the medications. Hav en't smoked since. I used many different techniques and meds including chantix. What finally worked was getting angry at myself for being so selfish about my own stinky vice.""I did it cold turkey, sucked being out of gas when having to run..
Six years smoke-free, I am a gymbro now and enjoy having better health and breathing""Quitting at the same time as my best friend. We had both tried numerous times on our own and it never lasted long. Quitting at the same time meant we could be non-smoking buddies at parties full of smokers. I've made it now, recently visited friends who smoke in their apartment and shared joints with them, didn't relapse with regular cigarettes even while under the influence in a room full of smoke and after having gotten nicotine from the joints. And my friend wasn't there either. So yeah, this worked, I'm a non-smoker for good this time. The other times it basically only stuck as long as I could go without visiting smokers or going to parties.""The day I realized I was actually going to die from lung disease one day if I kept smoking was the last day I smoked.  For years I fooled myself into thinking that lung cancer etc only happened to other people...one day it hit me like a ton of bricks, ""this will F*ing kill me!""  Quit cold turkey, best thing I ever did. ""I used gum. I went by the directions on the box to taper down. It was a good method for me because smoking was as much habit as addiction. It gave me something to do with my mouth, and if I really needed a nicotine hit at work, I could have one without finding time for a smoke break (I worked in a school and had to leave campus to smoke). ""Food poisoning. Seriously. It wasn't done on purpose, for obvious reasons, but for 3-4 days I couldn't keep anything down. So I didn't smoke either. After the food poisoning I went almost a full week without smoking so I figured why the hell not try for 2 weeks? When I hit two weeks I tried for a month, and when I did a full month I felt so good that I wanted to keep riding that wave of awesome. Haven't bought a pack in 2 years. So yeah food poisoning got me to quit smoking. :)""Zyban helped a lot.  Didn't feel any different when I started taking it but when I stopped smoking that massive craving attack just never came.  There were still cravings, it wasn't so different from cold turkey, just more bearable.  I felt like I was close to being able to do it on my own, just needed an extra edge and the drug seemed to provide it.  Had no adverse symptoms while on it and felt nothing on withdrawal (I was a little worried about cravings coming back but it was 3 months later so I pretty much had it licked).""I knew it was time to quit when my boyfriend kissed me and said, ""mmm, menthol."" That was it. I replaced my cig break at work with a 15 minute walk. "I was just done one day ate a ton of altoids.  Here i am back at a call center job and started... though I've not had one in 2 days... so i have that going for me.I can't seem to get addicted to smoking. Believe me I've tried. I always just get bored and quit.Quitting for me was very simple. I partied way to hard (and smoked like 2 cig packs to my dome) one nye and woke up new years day with pneumonia. After experiencing how hard and painful it was to just breathe only with pneumonia I knew right then that I would never be a smoker again."Pregnancy. Still, would not recommend this method for everyone.""I quit for two years cold turkey from heavy use of snuff (snuff typically has 2-3 more nicotine per pinch vs one cigarette).  I did snuff from age 19 to age 30.

Then I got into cigars in the early 1990's.  At first it was relaxing and enjoyable, within a few years I was chain smoking cigars that cost $8 $20 each.

I found the nicotine gum was helpful first time I quit snuff.  I used the gum for a couple of weeks and then was able to stop.  

When I quit cigars in 2010 I used Chantix, worked great, 1 hour after first dose I tried to smoke a really outstanding cigar.  The cigar tasted like a burning dried turd.  Down side of Chantix is that it is very dangerous, many psychological and physical side effects.  I did the Chantix for 2-3 days, I had dreams those nights like I had taken a hit of LSD.

I had one slip in 2010, smoked a box of my favorite cigars I found in a walk-in closet that had fallen out of sight.  I had been cigar free for about a year at this point.  I smoked all 50 cigars in 5 days, I was like a crack addict.

My cure was to book a ticket to Ireland, I spent 3 weeks there and was so relaxed I never felt like smoking.  I have been free for 4 years, I still occasionally get a craving, but I do deep breathing and it passes.

Good luck.""Hypnotherapy worked best for me. Smoked a pack a day for 15 years and tried several different methods but nothing worked for me. Found a reputable  hypnotherapist and after a90 minute session I quit completely.... No cravings, no mood swings. You do have to WANT to quit however, there is no way to quit if you don't want to."I got pregnant.  It was the hardest thing I've ever done. 4.5 years later I still miss it and the only reason I haven't started again is because there's no way I'd ever be able to quit without the threat of my kid's health being the motivator. "Medical student: I want to give you a hug.  I see to many parents continue to smoke around their children despite low birth rate, repeated respiratory infections, asthma exacerbations it breaks my heart.""I swapped smoking for running. I didn't want to gain weight after quitting smoking and it's also really hard to be a good runner when you're a professional smoker. It was a few months of hacking up rainbows of phlegm and nasty lung butter but I kept running. Running gives me that same gratification and relaxation as smoking. Bonus - I got super fit, smelled better and stopped coughing all the time!"So basically it looks like I'm going to have to have a kid to quit smoking.Switched to chewing in college because you can do it in class and while sitting in a computer lab all godam day.The electronic cigarette? By the do you mean BLU or some other cheap brand? Those are terrible; a real rig = quitting."I know I'm late, but any suggestion helps... I needed to stop going out. Any clubs/bars that had smoking going on, I couldn't attend. Once I got away from smokers and started to befriend people who hated smoking, it became a whole lot easier."Ecigs (vaporizers). I smoked a pack a day for 22 years and I started vaping in August 2013 and have not even desired a cig since. On top of that I am down to 6mg nicotine in my juice which is really low.Will power and a new vice...  my fingernails have suffered but it's still better. Plus I picked up running. It's a healthier way to abuse my lungs."Just realize that you can't have another.  Not another pack, not a single when you're drunk at a party.  You just can't.  Tell yourself mentally that you can't.  Just...don't...do it.  It's honestly that simple.  Be firm with yourself.""I had to resurrect a memory from my days in the military. I was at training school and a bunch of us were getting busted by the class commanders for drinking in the barracks. I was caught as I tried to escape the party and pulled aside by two sergeants. During the conversation the one, real arrogant guy asked me why I was doing this. I tried to cop an excuse that alcoholism runs in my family and he said to me ""You know what I think it is? I think you're just a weak minded little bitch!"" That stuck with me through the years because it pissed me off so bad and I couldn't do a thing about it, couldn't even hit the guy. Years later I brought that comment and those feelings to the surface and said to myself ""If you can't quit smoking you're a weak minded little bitch, don't let him be right."" Quit cold turkey purely on wills and have never looked back after 7-8 years of smoking.""I posted this a few days ago in another thread. 

>I have a friend who smokes with me. I usually smoke only with him or when I go drinking with friends. I'm mentioning him because of a change I noticed in him. He's quite handsome, good with the ladies and rich. But a few days ago I noticed that his teeth appeared to be decaying and black in color. His lips were black, too. Actually, even a few girls we were hanging out with noticed this and pointed it out. The thing is, I saw this and couldn't smoke at all. I haven't smoked for two days after almost two years of smoking. Something about how unattractive he looked, just made me totally not want to smoke. Hopefully, it's forever. 


Been a week now. Still going. Really had a strong urge today, but just kind of kept telling myself that I'm not a kid anymore. I should have more discipline. 
""I used to smoke a pouch of rollies every couple days. I ran out of smokes one morning, and decided not to go buy more. Instead I ate an eighth of mushrooms and climbed a mountain. That experience, under those circumstances did it for me. ""Not me but my dad he got really sick one night from smoking. He said ""do you think i will die tonight"" and other things about death and he was all around blabbering nonsense. After that day i never saw him once pick up a cig ever again and that's why i never wanted to ever smoke "Electronic cigarettes!!!!! "I was my daughter actually.  One day she came to me and begged me to give up smoking as she was afraid that I would die eventually if I didn't.  Honestly I couldn't say no to that so I threw my last pack away, got some patches and went from there.

The trick I found was to keep my mind busy.  So I threw myself into work and online gaming, anything really to keep my mind off the smokes.  My daughter seemed to know what I was going through with the withdrawals so there were lots more hugs and cuddles from her to make things easier.

Try to introduce an exercise regime into the process as well as once you give up the smokes you do put on the pounds as I found out.""I told myself this: If I were dropped onto a desert island with plenty of food and water, but no smokes, I'd be just fine. Keeping that thought in my mind made it relatively easy for me to just stop.

I wonder if it'll help others."Told my classmates I have angina and they took it. Whole class keep reminding me to quit smoking and yeaahhh haven't smoked for 3 months... But drinking is another problem "I quit while staying with friends who had already quit. We smoked a cigar here and there to temper nic fits and threw a lot of disc golf. I think staying active helped more than the cigars, but they were pretty clutch.
Good luck!""I always told my self while smoking, that I'm not smoking. Even though I clearly was. I just kept telling myself that I wasn't, and eventually it led me to stop. The same worked for nailbiting.

I don't think this is a method a lot of people have heard of.. but it worked for me just perfect.""The first time i quit (about 7 years ago) i got bronchitis and was pretty unable to even get myself out of bed for almost two weeks (it turned into severe pneumonia). During that time i obviously didn't touch a cigarette, and when i was finally better i just said to myself, ""you are already this far, why go back now"" so i just didn't smoke. I didn't smoke another cig for probably 5 years, and then i started up again ""because of a new job"". I smoked a pack a year for at least a year and a half and then i just cut it out, cold turkey. I had already quit before i knew that the  cravings went away so i just threw out my last pack and haven't bought one since.

TL;DR don't be a bitch, quit like a man."I stopped buying em."I was a smoker since age 17 and had attempted to quit multiple times (some times lasting as long as 6 months)... I genuinely wanted to quit, which is the one thing you absolutely NEED, so I decided to buy an electronic cigarette.. I started with the $10 disposable ones and eventually upgraded to a $35 dollar reusable one. I have not bought a pack of cigarettes for over a year and have not smoked a cigarette since I don't even know when. I will warn anyone who tries it this way that although the E cig is a great way to quit, you may find yourself suddenly 'smoking' at times/in places you never did before. I found myself on the couch watching tv puffing away! Once I got my head on straight however I have been cigarette-free and no longer want or need my electronic friend either :) I recommend this method to anyone trying to quit cause worst case scenario you're now addicted to a less harmful form of nicotine that won't drive anyone with a sense of smell very far away. Good luck to anyone trying to quit! One last piece of advice- NO excuse is a good excuse to smoke! Reward yourself for resisting the urge with something you truly enjoy. Your kids, partner, parents, friends and pets will all be glad you quit.. And guess what?! Even you will be so happy you quit too! You can do it :)"Being broke and I don't want my daughter to smoke.Electronic cigarettes are really the way to go.. Cigarette free 4 months now!"I had to quit for a few reasons,  but what really helped was Wellbutrin. I was prescribed it for other issues, but it not only made the smoking taste a lot worse, it also helped cut out the cravings almost completely.  By the time I decided to quit for good,  I had no issues going cold turkey. amazing stuff if you can get your doc to prescribe it for you. ""A good quality e cig, not the gas station bullshit, with some really good quality juice did the trick for me. Gas station vapes are not even in the same category as the mods out there now. Check out /r/electronic_cigarette "Pneumonia. It's a hell of a motivator. I couldn't smoke at that time and decided not to start back up. That was a year ago on the 5th. "Go on a vacation! Isolate yourself in a place where there's no stress with somebody to keep an eye on you. Go knowing that you will come back a non-smoker, Get clean ala cold turkey,  and stay clean.  

That's how I did it. I went on a cruise for my honeymoon and came back clean. ""The Patch.  I wore it FOREVER!  Seriously.  I talked to my doctor about the patch and feeling that if I stopped wearing it, at the time, that I was afraid that I'd start smoking again.  He said whatever the patch might do to me, cigarettes would do but a hundred times worse.  Anyway, I've been off of it for about six months now but I wore it for several years (yes, years).  I stepped down the nicotine level once a YEAR!  Anyway, I also started exercising a lot and finally took it off and haven't had one since.  

Whatever you need to do to stop smoking, do it!  There is no method of quitting that works for everyone, but one will work for you.  Keep trying until you get it right.  Good luck!""DUM DUMS!!! The bar I frequented had dum dums as bar favors, so I would eat them when everyone would have a smoke. And, I would fill my pockets when I left the bar, so I would have something to gnaw on when I had a craving.""I was turning 60. Smoked all my life. Ridiculously tried to hide it from my kids, but they knew. Finally late one night, standing outside having a cigarette, it all came together for me. I wasn't stopping something I was gaining something. I was going to get a new breath (literally) on life. I was going to run without running out of breath. I was going to smell nice. I was going to taste my food. I was going to be healthy and see my grand kids grow up. Mostly I was going to feel great about myself. From then on I did 2 things. Whenever the urges came I focused on what I was gaining not on what I was losing. Secondly whenever the urges came I used a suggestion I got from my son. I kept repeating. Wow this is much easier than I thought. The urge is already starting to go away. 
Power of positive thought. Sounds corny but it worked for me. Smoke free 10 months after 45 years of smoking. 
I wish you easy breathing. ""I couldn't fuck for more than 4 minutes without having to stop because i was out of breath and my heart felt like it was going to implode. That alone was quite depressing/distressing. Also my grandma told me if i can make it a whole year without smoking she'd throw me a party. I promised her I'd quit and from that moment on i felt like smoking would be a form of lying to her. In some ways it gets easier with time, and worshipping that idea as an undeniable truth is crucial. For months i counted the days, deriving strength from their growth.  "I used a great book by Alan Carr. I haven't had a ciggie for nearly three years but more importantly I don't ever want one. Its called how to stop smoking and it comes from a guy who had your problem but set it down on paper as to why he struggled and worked out why.

And actually wanting to quit. "It's a mindset thing. Most of the addiction is mental, the physical part is nothing. Preparation is key. Although by no means THE blueprint 
(if there is such a thing), I did the following: 1.) make parts of your territory no smoking areas. Start with your car and your bedroom, later the whole house. After that adopt habits of not smoking in public or in the street specifically. Most of all stop being a social smoker. Smoking with other smokers reinforces the false belief that it is a benefit. By all means hang out with your smoker friends, but don't smoke with other people. Get rid of all traces of tobacco, the smell and the paraphernalia. Gradually increase these areas until you have only a few smoking zones and times in your daily routine. 2.) There are loads of books and other aids to help you prepare mentally and understand the process. Check them out. It may or may not be for you, but the fact that you're here indicates that this is already part of your plan. 3.) Before you quit, if you are not an active person, take up a physical activity, be it cycling, swimming, the gym, whatever suits you. If you have a physical, cardiovascular benchmark as the benefits of not smoking start to kick in, you will be in a position to really appreciate them and your motivation to  stay quit will be so much stronger. If you are already active, it literally takes two weeks to feel serious improvements in physical performance when exercising  4.)Once you have picked a quit date, stick to it. Arrange your quit date and your life around the date so that you have the best possible chance of staying quit. Take some time off work or plan your quit date around a holiday. If you associate smoking with alcohol, stay off the bottle for a few months after your quit date and when you do drink, try a different poison (cider instead of beer or whatever) 5.)finally as a redditor, subscribe to r/stopsmoking. It is a brilliant community of 20 000 + people who know what you are going through and will offer you support all the way through the process and beyond. As your badge accumulates days and you can start to offer advice to others you will be even more gratified that you made the change. Good luck."Actually wanting to quit was the biggest help.

Quit cold turkey right then.""I used a step-down method. 

I smoked right at a pack a day. I decided that I'd allow myself a whole pack that week, then one less the next. 19, 18, 17. Kept that up for a while. Weeks passed, was at 10, 9, 8. Found that I could go quite a while without fiending for a drag. 5, 4, 3. Went two weeks at five, and four. Once I got to 3, I didn't want to smoke any more.

I started smoking at 14, just a few cigs a day. Then, things escalated and last year, at 38, I smoked 30 cigs a day. I was sick of the smell, I was having stomach pain at the end of each day, my breath was short. I'm in normal shape, but my heart was suffering.

I broke my radius and kneecap later that day in a bouldering accident. The doctor told me my bones would heal faster if I kept off of stogies. I did. I still want one everyday."I smoked 2 packs a day for about 30 years and got tired of coughing up brown crud every morning.  Tried to quit on my own I don't know how many times; no luck.  Joined a structured program which worked on the principle that nobody was born a smoker, and that we all had to learn to smoke.  The program got you to record when you smoked, then attacked smoking habit by habit.  For the first 5 years or so after I had my ""last"" cigarette, I'd smoke a cigarette on the anniversary of quitting to see if I still wanted to remain a non-smoker.  About year 6, I coughed my lungs out and nearly lost my lunch, so decided that the cure was permanent and haven't smoked since.

If you are finding it hard to quit on your own, look for a program where you're with a bunch of people who also want to quit and who support each other.  Even if the program is expensive, it's cheap--my program cost me $500, and at 2 packs/day paid for itself in a couple of months.  More importantly, it's the gift that keeps on giving.  At ten bucks a day, or whatever smokes cost now, it doesn't take long to build a a holiday fund, or buy a car, or whatever.  ""I'm not a smoker, but me dad was. 35 years. Heavy smoker. 

He went and got himself an e-cigarette with the strongest possible liquid. Then over the course of 3 months he weaned himself of nicotine using increasingly weaker liquids until one day he completely stopped.

Seems to work just fine for him. Seeing as he's in the 4th year now non smoking.""chewing tobacco. quitting that sucked, though. pretty sure not dying was my main motivator."I smoked harsher and harsher cogs until I didn't like it anymore. And I didn't want any of my family members to find out. Plus it just stank the shit out of my clothes."I smoked for 10 years.  I woke up one morning, and swore on my mothers life I would never smoke again.  Tossed my cigarettes, never cheated once.  That was 2 years ago.

Best decision I've ever made.  I even got my girlfriend,  now fiancÌ© to quit at the same time."A girl I liked hated it."Im young and have no dependants. I just noticed little changes and I understood how bad it really was so the next day I just stopped. I understand the concept of how to the addictive nicotine can be but the idea of not quitting something that is deadly to you just does not

Edit: process.""I quit after 20 years as a smoker. I was 14 when I started. For me, I quit not only for the health of my kids, but for my own as well. I was having constant chest and arm pains, my doc told me it was my capillaries not expanding properly. Apparently from the overuse of nicotine over the years. 

I used the first stage of the patch + hard candies to help me through the first couple of weeks. The patch really helps take the edge off the cravings and the hard candies fulfill the oral fixation of puffing on a cigarette. 

I also feel that your mentality towards it plays a big role in your success. Every time I wanted a cigarette I'd make myself think of cigs on disgusting ways. Ya know, wet, soggy, stinking ashtrays full of butts, those pictures of blackened lungs they show you in school. Anything to convince myself that smoking was a disgusting, filthy habit. 

Good luck! I hope you succeed!""Simply downloaded an app which records how much money I spend on cigarettes. After a week I saved about 25 bucks. Actually recording it made me see how much I was saving. I have been clean for about two months, have saved over 180 bucks, and feel fantastic.
""Just rage at the thought of Big Tobacco paying the smartest minds they can find to make cigarettes *more addictive than ever before*. Think about them smiling from behind the wheel of their Bentley's and Lambo's while, you're fighting a war with your own body that they want you to lose. But you're not going to take that shit! You're going to win! FUCK BIG TOBACCO!""- You need 1 week to kick the worst of it. Any source of nicotine (gum, vape) will destroy this. Cold turkey is the way.
- If possible, do it while you are sick as you are already feeling bad for a few days.
- Don't keep any cigarettes at home. If you buy, buy the worst tasting, the one you really hate.
- While you do smoke, get used to smoking the cigarettes that have 0 additives. Part of the good taste and addiction is in the extra chemicals.
- Understand that all internal dialog is motivated towards games that drive smoking while you are addicted. Recognize the personalities that rise with various moods who end up smoking:
    - The angry person.
    - The wild party person.
    - The self pitying pathetic person.
    - The ... (name them)
- Don't drink alcohol, at all, while you quit.
- Change your life in other ways too, for healthier, like doing sports.
- Find new ways to spend your time doing something you like other than smoking or related activities.
""1. Read Allan Car's Easy Way to stop smoking.

2. Every time you have a cigarette, pause and think about it- what are you expecting this ciggy will do for you? Give you a ""hit"" of relaxation and satisfaction? Make you feel good? Top up your nicotine levels and keep you from feeling on-edge?

3. Take Champix/Chantix. Keep in mind there are a lot of people who had bad reactions, it was linked to something like 500 suicides. Be aware of that BEFORE you take it, and do a daily sanity check- how do I feel? How was I yesterday? Have I been feeling down, or negative, or sad, or is my job/relationship/life getting to me more than usual?

Keep on top of it, it only takes a few weeks. I stopped after two weeks but a full course is two months.

Reading the book gave me the mindset I needed, that I WANT to quit and there is literally nothing about it that gives me reason to continue.

The part 2 of my plan is understanding that it is not giving me what I want or expect. Our brains reward us with a jolt of pleasure or satisfaction when we have a smoke. Not the nicotine, our brains. Poker machines (slot machines in casinos) are designed to hit the right light, hz, and sound frequencies to do the same. Realise that your brain is giving you that feeling of satisfaction and the nicotine is giving you very little of anything, and it will be ten times easier to quit- the mental barrier is the hardest part. Thinking you need it and convincing yourself it will be super satisfying (which it wont be, your brain will just reward you with more oxytocin or endorphins or whatever for giving it what you mentally convinced it it was waiting for). Understanding that it is a trick of the mind is the key to beating the trick. Once you know the cigarette is not actually giving you 90% of that ""satisfaction"" feeling, you stop getting that satisfaction feeling from cigarettes. But you have to work on it. Retrain your brain.

Taking Chantix takes away some of that reward as well, it can stop you feeling happy. Expect a pretty dull and boring few weeks. I suggest planning a few weeks in (no clubbing or partying). Play through a good RPG game. I played through Torchlight 2 and some of Terraria. They allowed me to still get a kick of joy or satisfaction in my life, from upgrading my weapons etc, or beating a world/boss.

Replace smoking at work with something else. In your job, you only get a break if you go outside, right? Count how many mini-breaks you take now, for how long, talk to your boss about implementing a quit smoking plan where people can take that time to go somewhere quiet to read a book or watch a TV show/movie. Something that gives them excitement, to replace the kick of a cigarette. Point out that if it works, it will mean less smokers and less sick days. I started to watch movies on my breaks, in the office. I would make a hot drink (chocolate, herbal tea- peppermint or chamomile), and start watching from where I left off.

Now I am studying something I find super rewarding every time I get a free 5 mins. The idea of going for a smoke is about as appealing as inhaling dust from a vacuum cleaner bag.

Combining those three phases, one after the other (give it a week between starting each, IMO), is like a one-two-three combo to give you the info you need to want to quit, the mindset to be ready to quit, then take away the last scrap of pleasure from it so that quitting is as easy as taking a day off work, then another, and another and so on. "Have kids. Discover how much more expensive life insurance is when you're a smoker. Cold turkey."Acid - not a word of a lie. It's nothing spectacular but i once took some acid with my girlfriend and the morning after we went downstairs and into the back garden for a smoke. But what was this, this horrible taste in my mouth everytime i took a toke? I tried an hour later, a day later, a week later, a month later, but the taste is the same... And my deaire for it less. Eventually i gave up, now im not even a social smoker. I attribute my newly found clean respiratory system to acid... Thank you acid! You've probably added on many years.""Not me, but my friend told me that what ultimately led to him quitting was his father's lack of belief in him. When my friend had told him that he would quit smoking his response was ""Yeah sure, when hell freezes over."" He's been 'clean' for five years now!""I quit once for 6 years but I relapsed. Then I must have made another 20 attemptsÛ?in vain. I tried Chantix which made me depressed and crazy, I tried the patch and I tried Nicorette. A night out with a couple of drinks and I was right back where I started. 
My cousin Patrick, 5 month older than me just got diagnosed with lung cancer in August 2013. He died in October. I have not smoked since and decided never to do so in his honor. It has been 106 days. Just keep on trying!""After trying to quit on 3 separate occasions the one that proved to be the successful one was having the mentality to just want to quit. I remember the exact second it hit me while standing outside a roadside store in the middle of nowhere, NV that sticking a plant in my mouth wasn't very cool, and not a very glamorous way to die. So I stamped it out and have never had one since (2 years and counting!). I still crave one every damn day but I have a higher will power that just says ""no you don't. don't even think about it"". Took me a lot of years to get to that point but it is the best choice I have ever made in my life and it has rewarded greatly with more friends, money, and most especially TIME saved. My trigger was corner stores and 7-11's. Today I still can't go in one without my hands trembling at the counter. Some things you're going to have to sacrifice like that and its going to suck a lot, but as silly as it sounds we're addicts, and you need to change your environment as much as possible sometimes. "Self control"I've never really quit for good, but I've quit a few times for over a year each time. When I quit, it was always cold turkey. When I start back up, it's usually for the very same reason I started smoking in the first place... all the people around me are smoking.""Not being able to breath one fine morning.

I started taking Chantix for the second time, and less than a week, I was done. Haven't wanted a cigarette in four years.

And really dont care for the smell anymore. Still have a hard time breathing, sometimes."I just stopped.  It was easy. I did it for 5 years."As simple as it sounds you have to want it. I tried multiple times before it worked. I ate sunflower seeds constantly for a few weeks. I also cut an ink pen in half and ""smoked"" it. I believe the motion helped. Take it one minute at a time. The first weeks was brutal. After a month is when it became easier. It will have been 5 years since my last cigarette next month. Good luck and stay the course!""I quit after 9 years of a 2 pack a day habit, on my 3rd attempt. It was a combination of using the patch and switching jobs - I was working retail at the time, and by moving to a new job, I never got in the habit of taking regular smoke breaks.

My mom died of lung cancer a few years later after 3 terrible months in the hospital, so if I ever felt any urge to go back to smoking, that ended it.

I still have dreams where I go buy a pack of cigarettes though. Always wake up in a panic thinking I actually did it.""I calculated how much money I had given Phillip Morris to make myself a shittier person.  It was over $30,000.  As a result, I was physically inferior (I couldn't have run a mile if my life depended on it.). I was irritable without them (I would drive to the store at 3 in the morning for more smokes.  If I was out of milk?  Meh.  I'll figure it out in the morning, but smokey treats?  Putting on my slippers and a coat and finding my keys.). They made me smell horrible.  My clothes, my body, my hair.

Ultimately, I came to this conclusion: Cigarettes didn't actually make me feel *good*.  They could get me back up to zero, but never above that.  What I mean, is that when I ""needed"" one, either after a meal, right when I got in the car, right after sex (although, I do still miss that one.  But it's been *years* since I smoked in a bed, but the post-coital smoke really is amazing.), when one or more of my friends decided their nicotine monster was cranky, or if I was having an awful, bad, rotten day.  Or a derivative of one.  Anyway, when I was in ""need"" of one, it could bring me back to zero.  Without them, I was deep in the negative.  (However, I still had to deal with whatever problem was bothering me in the first place ....)  And then I got to places where I couldn't smoke, and it became irritating.  Couldn't smoke in bars, couldn't smoke in open-air football stadiums (still don't understand that one), and I didn't like the feeling of wanting a smoke, but not being able to have one.

So, I quit.  Not sure why they call it 'cold turkey', but that was my method.  The hard part was convincing myself it was necessary.  But once I quit, I never wanted to experience *that* again, so I told myself that if I ever take another drag of a smoke, I'm going to have to quit again, and quitting sucks.  But it will not work until *you* decide you want to do it.  Then figure out a reason, and constantly remind yourself about it.  The alternative is to smoke until you die.  And we all know that smoking will make that day come quicker.

/$0.02"I just stopped smoking.e cigarette and weed"I was never addicted.  I smoked cigarettes for 2 years and then stopped.  I never romanticized them or even gave a shit, it was just part of the culture I was in.  Once I left that culture I left it.

Just the thought or smell of a cigarette makes me feel sick to my stomach."My bitch ex girlfriend told me I'd never quit. I haven't smoked since, and I was smoking about 15 hand rolled cigarettes that I LOOOVED. But fuck her and her pretty mouth. 

That and a yo-yo so I could do something with my hands. ""I used to smoke A LOT. Here are some advices:
- Quit cold turkey.
- Promise yourself to quit smoking for 15 days (it is what it takes to nicotine to leave your system). Make a calendar and mark each day. After that it gets easier, believe me.
- Drink a lot of water (dissolves nicotine). 
- Try to exercise, nothing too hard. Eat healthy Fruits are your friend.
- Keep yourself busy. Do things you never do.
- Try not to be around smokers at first.
- If you are like me you have cigarrettes for every ocassion. Try to substitute them for something else (water, tea, peanuts, gum).
- Seek for support of friends and family.
- Cannabis helped for me, specially at night (I used to smoke 3-4 cigarrettes before going to sleep).

Good luck. It is not that hard. If I did it you can do it too. Come on!""I left my only pack of cigarettes on the kitchen table and they disappeared. None of my housemates ever fessed up. I decided right then and there that they were already too expensive to be smoked and CERTAINLY too expensive to be stolen.

Never bought another pack. Cold turkey FTW.""i was a casual smoker for years, maybe a pack a week, mostly while drinking. i ramped up when i got a new job where the only respite was outside smoke breaks, and i was having a lot of home life stress. i was drinking a ton too. 

what killed smoking for me is something pretty counterintuitive and ill-advised. i got a promotion at work that required i go to austin, tx for a month of training. being a smoky/drinky dude, i went overboard. waaaay overboard. i found there was a camel lounge in a bus that would park up and down sixth on the weekends, and if you went in, they'd give you free butts and snus, and coupons for dollar packs at any convenience store. after a couple cartons worth of cheapo camel filters over a month of training, i returned home just sick of smoking. i lost the taste for it by smoking too much and was just done with it like that. ""I quit using e-cigs. But that won't help at all, as you're experiencing, unless you actually ***want*** to quit. I don't mean the -want- like you want a pepperoni pizza either. It's the determination within you to know It's time to stop. The feeling of out growing a habit. The self righteous feeling of having control over your life. You want to stop. Do it because you can. Do it because you're ready. ""First, you actually have to be DRIVEN to quit. Simply ""wanting to"" won't cut it. There have to be tangible and immediate consequences for not quitting. If there aren't, then it's going to be much tougher.

For me, my tangible and immediate consequence of not quitting was the fear of turning my daughter into a smoker. I picked up a six-week supply of Nicorette. I chewed the crap out of that gum for two days. On the third day, I decided to see what would happen if I stopped chewing it. Come to find out, I was done with smoking AND chewing the gum.

So, for what it's worth, I highly recommend chewing Nicorette.""NIcotine Anonymous. I laughed at first. Really? Like AA, but for smokers? But I was desperate. Smoking had a vicious hold on me. I went with an open mind, and it worked. I was amazed. Early on, every day was like looking over my shoulder. I was so used to trying to quit, and that moment when I'd give up and go buy ciggs. But this time the beast didn't come back. That was about twelve years ago. I've run a half dozen marathons since then. And believe me, I am truly grateful. I never take it for granted, and I have no illusions about how addicted I was. I sympathize with anyone trying to quit. I'd suggest NA."Mother said a month-long bout of Laryngitis helped her quit.I quit cold turkey and being a man had kid of an opposite support system.

I live in the UK and cigarettes are very expensive (å£8-9 a pack). The expense was just too much.  I'd tried to give up before and never lasted more than 6 weeks. This time, on the recommendation of a friend, I (at first very sceptically) read Alan Carr's 'Easy Way to Stop Smoking'. By about 3/4 of the way through I didn't want to smoke anymore.

I had tried to quit probably 10 times, but to no avail. Now, I've been smoke free for 5 months and 2 days. The real secret is that there is no secret. You just have to really want to quit. I was completely disgusted with myself, thinking about how long I had been smoking (especially when compared to my age). At 25 years old I had been smoking for 13 years, I just couldn't take it anymore. My best advice to you, look yourself in the mirror. Take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror and think about what you're doing. Next time you light up, do it in front of a mirror. Watch yourself smoke that cigarette and think about what a disgusting sack of tar infested crap you are. Learn to hate what you're doing. Then, when you quit, you have to reprogram your triggers. After coffee when you get that urge, remind yourself that its just the nicotine talking. That craving will soon be gone.  ""May not be helpful but I rolled 20 joints and every time I wanted a cig, I smoked (part of) a joint. Worked like a charm because I ended up not wanting to get high so often so I tapered off. Still smoke herb but no cigs since about 1999/2000.""My grandfather, who quit smoking 30 years ago, told me that he always thought smoking was stupid but it was just his habit to whiz through a pack of smokes a day. Something he had been doing since he was a teenager he claims. He says he quit once he learned that he was going to be a grandfather. ""Here's what worked for me. I got fed up with how it made me feel, and I stopped. You won't be able to successfully quit unless you truly want to, and for me that took being sick and tired of feeling the way that I felt. ""I decided to quit when I was 23.  I tried different things for a few months but I'd go back, then I had an idea that worked.  I quit by getting up early and running 20 minutes nonstop - every single morning - no exceptions.  This was not just do a jog, after I warmed up I'd force myself into those God awful wind sprints the gym coaches love so dearly.  If I smoked the night before I'd  start coughing and gasping for air.  My lungs would burn and the heaves were really awful.  I would not stop.  I might have to slow to a jog but then it was another wind sprint until I was physically sick.  If I'd had cigarettes the night before it didn't take very long.  Also you should know I've never liked running.  I don't get any satisfaction from it.  I will ride a bike all day but pounding the pavement is punishment for me.  

The pain of running was greater than any discomfort I felt from quitting.   I'd look at my friend smoking and I knew if I had one and took a few puffs there would be hell to pay at 5:45 AM.  

I read it takes three weeks to start a new habit or break a bad one.  I was done with smoking after the first week but I stuck with my plan and  ran for 21 days then stopped.  It's been decades and I haven't had a cigarette since.   ""One weird trick from a housewife in Provo, UT!
Tobacco companies hate her!""What actually got me to quit? My mother in law had a heart attack. (She survived and is doing well at the moment) But I had been really planning this a week before New Years Day to start the resolution off right - then my mother in law had her heart attack on Dec. 31st, and I quit a day early. I had been down to 2-3 cigarettes a day for the last month so it wasn't a huge leap either, though.

I was just sick of waking up with crappy lungs, the smoke odor, and I could see it was affecting my cats too. Now I just use one of those e-Cigs if I get a craving. Yeah, I'm trying to quit that eventually too...

So here I am, 31 days smoke free. The longest I have not smoked since I started 5 years ago."I just recently quit I found that the patch made it very easy compared to cold turkey attempts that failed every time"I quit cold turkey when I got pregnant. No patches, I didn't ""cut down"" before quitting. Just did it. ""Anytime I felt the urge to smoke, I would drop and do 30 pushups. I also got into running which does wonders for motivating you to quit.""Friend's dad smoked.  He was the manly man type.  He wasn't about to quit!  Then I came along and befriended his brat of a kid.  He smoked because of his kid.  Once he saw his kid change (I was basically poor and he was stupidly rich so he became more humble), he was motivated to quit.  He basically just replaced his smoking habit with sucking on suckers.  He would only use the See's Candy ones.  He still enjoys a cigar about one or twice a month, but he's not addicted like he was.""I had tried many times to quit. Patches, Wellbutrin, Chantix and nothing stuck. I had smoked since I was 13 (31 now) and nothing I tried worked. What I didn't realize is that smoking isn't just a habit, it's a lifestyle. If all of your friends smoke and everyone smokes at all the places you go (bars), you're never going to be able to quit it. 
I finally said, I'm done after I was arrested for DWI and involved in an accident at Highway speeds. I resolved to change my lifestyle. 
The first thing I did was quit drinking. I am currently 2 totally sober. The second thing I did, and this was probably the hardest, was give up my old friends. They all smoked and it's impossible to quit if you're always around it. I also quit going to bars as I didn't drink any longer, there was no reason. 
I also met a very nice girl in one of my psychology classes who didn't drink or smoke. We started dating and I set a quit date. That's the next step. If just quit, you start thinking it's stupid and you hate yourself. If you have a set date you can use that a goal to strive for. 
The most important thing to have is support. Real support. Someone you can go to that is encouraging and not judgmental. My girlfriend was that person. I quit on her birthday and I'm 2 years with tobacco.
As for quitting smoking aids, everyone is different so I can't tell you what will work for you. What worked for me were the 4mg Equate brand nicotine gum from Walmart. It was 25 bucks for 100 pieces. I would chew about 8 or 9 in a day and it was hard, but I stuck with it, didn't have outside influence, had moral/emotional support and educated myself about addiction. Hope this helps someone quit! It's an awful, addictive habit and it basically makes you a slave to big tobacco. But you can only quit if actually want to. 

Tl;Dr, I used gum, quit my friends, quit drinking, and had someone for moral support. Quit a lifestyle is extremely hard. Get help and only attempt to quit if you are serious. 
"An awesome apartment with a no smoking clause."I tried many times without success. I began trying to smoke around age 7. My house was usually full of smoke from grandma constantly smoking, and I was probably already addicted without even being aware of it.  
 
I stole a half cigarette from an ashtray, some matches, and fired one up... it kinda burned my mouth and tasted awful so I put it out.  

I took up smoking for reals around age 15, and continued until I was 38 at ~a pack a day.  

I used the patch to help with the cravings, but the last 2 hours between patches were still painful. I had tootsie roll pops, and carrot sticks to help with the oral fixation.  

A few steps to success:  

* 1: Be 100% ready and committed. You got yourself into this mess, you can get yourself out. It will be difficult, but not impossible.
* 2: 3 principles: Don't smoke, don't hang out with smokers, don't hang out where people smoke (Bars, etc.)
* 3: Do not drink!!!! Drinking was always my downfall when trying to quit smoking. I quit drinking before I quit smoking and it really helped.  

I have been smoke free for over six years, and most days I'm not tempted to take it up again.

In the end the pill worked, but it was a rough road.""It took me a while, but what ended getting me to cut tobacco completely out of my diet was to stop smoking weed.

This isn't news to anyone, but I was able to get my brain to actively think this every time I lit up, and finally decided that I didn't want to do it anymore. That is the real key - getting your brain to actively not want to do it. Reading the Allen Carr book really helped with this for me.""threatened my dad at 15 that if he didnt stop smoking, i would start it the moment i went to college.  He quit cold turkey that day.  I'm 30 now and have been smoking for 11 years."I just fucking stopped one day. Brain tells you to smoke? Fuck that. Conscious decision not to."The day I chose to quit, I used a sharpie to write the date on my last pack. Whenever I'd fallen off the wagon to have smoke (maybe at the bar, maybe off a friend at work) I'd smoke a cigarette from my last pack when I got home. As you know, stale cigarettes don't taste great, and in time can become rather nasty. A month in, a cigarette from my last pack had me dry-heaving. Smoking on the floor next to the toilet, expecting to vomit. It's not at all pleasant, and before finishing that last pack I'd finished with smoking. Still have it today, with the date as a memento.

that this is your 5th attempt should not be discouraging. 

most people just decide to give up. When you relapse, acknowledge the relapse, acknowledge that your self control wasn't enough in that situation, try to give yourself a reason to think before you smoke next time at work. Even taking a minute to think about it before you smoke will help your self control become slightly stronger.

then next time you stop to think, try to will yourself away from it, and repeat all the good reasons not to smoke

1. my health will be better
2. I will be alive for an extra decade to be with my family and friends
3. I can climb the stairs without losing my breath

4. <insert personal reason here>

Please quit smoking."" I went out and got nicotine gum and was fully quit within 2 months. ""Smoked for 23 years, at least a pack a day, then I set a date, enjoyed my last one, made it through the 4 or 5 days of illogical, irrational thought, and haven't smoked since.  In the end, no matter what anyone tells you, it's a free-will decision - you have to decide what to do or not do.  Control, you must learn control.  Be the Jedi, YOU CAN DO IT.

You really need to commit when you take Chantix. Don't buy any more. Just trust the pill and distract yourself. 

I smoked for 21 years and I've been off them for 4 months. Now, if I'm around a lit cigarette, I gag and can't breathe. My co-worker smoked in my work truck with me in it and I had to stop to throw up. 

Chantix works...

(Edited for spelling)""I smoked for over 25 years and really actually enjoyed it. When I became pregnant I knew I had to quit. Luckily, the pregnancy made it easier as eventually even the smell made me nauseous. I didn't use any aids. I just rode out each craving. Think about or do something else to distract yourself and soon the cravings become fewer and further apart. It is really hard but so worth it. To this day, I will still occasionally crave a cigarette but find it repulsive when I try to smoke.""I've always wanted to quit but it didn't work until I found my now ex-girlfriend who hated cigarettes and refused to kiss me if I smoked. To say the least, that was a huge motivation. "The easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr."The best thing I did was GO OUTSIDE when I was craving a smoke and just breathe for a few minutes.  
Another thing I think is important is getting really drunk pretty early on in the quitting process like the first week.  I say this because people get afraid of getting drunk and slipping up and then your subconscious mind begins to think that you can't make it through a drunken night.  The longer you wait the more the pressure builds up.  But if you get wasted in the first few days of quitting and make it your goal not to smoke that night.  Then you have no excuse later on.  You have in effect proven to yourself that you can get wasted without smoking! 

And one last thing, it just sucks for about 3 months.  Then it's basically over.  So if you can resign yourself to that then you will be fine. 
Good LUCK! ""I wanted to quit for awhile. Then I started dating someone who told me she wouldn't date me if I kept on smoking. That was most of it right there. Then when I knew I was feeling weak I told my smoker friends to not let me have one no matter what I said and proceeded to get wasted with them at a bar. I wanted a cigarette more than I've ever wanted one, but didn't get one because they knew I'd be pissed later on. Another thing was to get my last two cigs and keep them in a drawer, because that way I had the option if I wanted them without buying a new pack. Then after they were stale (a month or so) I smoked one and it was fucking awful."I felt kinda dizzy one day - IT WAS A STROKE - QUIT RIGHT THEN ANDTHERE"No one ever really quits, a smokers a smoker when the chips are down -  Sin City"My mom is dead. That helped.Do not drink. I also floss my teeth a lot with the picks"I switched to a vaporizer and only buy my ejuice from Halo Ecigs. They are made in new jersey and only use FDA approved ingredients.

Some of us like Nicotine and treat it like the drug that it is. The nicotine itself though is not very harmful other than its habit forming potential.""I filled up my days with anything and everything I could think of where I wouldn't be able to smoke. Once I broke the routine of smoking , it was much easier to break the habit of smoking. I still hung out with friends/family that smoked, but the farther I got from my last smoke, the less I felt like another. Ten years now, and I have no interest in them.""Get a good vaporizer.  I tried the shitty $5 ones, and it was a joke.  

I got a nice one - the [Smok Woo](http://www.tastyvapor.us/smok-woo-kit-p-342.html?cPath=21&TVid=d890ffbe2b36061b829161bca2e16115) - and was able to quit with that in a month.  Two of my good friends (both long time smokers) used the same kit, and had the same results.  It's really, really good.

My biggest suggestion is to treat it just like a cigarette - use it only when you'd use a regular cigarette, and just let it take over that role in your life.""By making it completely not fun. This works more of you're addicted to the habit and routine instead of the nicotine. 

Instead of saying. ""Ok I can't smoke"", you impose rules. No smoking inside or in a car. No smoking while talking. No smoking half an hour either side of eating or drinking. No smoking while seated. No smoking while talking. 

It makes smoking into a really unpleasant activity and really helped me quit. Haven't bought a pack this year! "I am an extremist which means I have to do everything full on or not. I just stopped. That was it."Cold turkey. I just stopped one day after smoking for 6 years.  I got tired of spending money on it and ""needing a break"" for one.

After the first one my doctor said "" you know those people you hear about who smoke 2 packs a day until they're 90, will you're not one of them...""  My smoking had given me blebs which ultimately led to me collapsing my lung.  After the second one I had to have surgery.  It is really the most painful thing I have ever experienced.  Afterward though I spent 3 weeks in a hospital bed super high on pain meds playing WoW.  Haven't smoked since, real or Ecig.  It's been 6 years.  I trued the patch, it's shit.  I tried proxy (candy replacement), no luck.  3 weeks of detox where smoking isn't an option, that was my ticket.  

TL:DR smoker's rehab""Cold turkey for me. But what helped was researching nicotine addiction A LOT. I read everything I could get my hands on about how addiction works in the brain. I became smarter than my addiction was strong, made a date in the future that would be my last day as a smoker (in my case, it was the day before my birthday) and had my last smoke. I haven't taken a single puff since, and that was about 3 and a half years ago. Best decision I've ever made."Vapes. Not talking about the blu ecig. "I was nearly 300 pounds, medicated and desperately needed a change.  I started working out with a personal trainer three times per week.  I needed to lose weight before going on a study abroad trip in Asia and I didn't want to slow my group down.  After my first workout my lungs hurt so much that the last thing I wanted was a cigarette.  I had no intention of quitting, but the workout kicked my ass and I just lost the appetite to smoke.  I really got a feeling of how fragile an organ the lungs really are.  My last cigarette was coincidentally on New Years Eve, 2011.  The mental  craving was strong for four months and still sometimes comes back when I'm under stress.  ""I was bedridden for an entire week leaking pus and blood out of both of my ears due to a double ear drum rupture, which was the pinnacle of the habitual ear infections I was dealing with every year. That was the most pain I have ever experienced. Since I had a staunch rule of not smoking inside, on top of being deathly ill for a solid week, I simply didn't have a smoke the entire time. The misery of the ear infections distracted me from that first major nicotine withdrawel period, so when I felt better, I decided it was a good head start, and I never had another cigarette. That was five years ago now, and the ear infections stopped immediately after that as well. 

Edit: voice to text is terrible at context.""I switched over from pre packaged smokes to rollies like two months ago. I still roll them with a filter like some do over in europe, but it really saves me a ton of money. A pouch only costs like $5 with filters and papers. And the way I look at it is, If I reeeealy want a cigarette, I have to work for it and actually roll it. If I don't, then I don't have one. Really helped me cut down on my intake."A public letter or blog promising people and myself I was quitting and then just going cold turkey. I did this after putting up a blog on my Myspace page many many years ago. I think it worked due to me trying to keep my word on something. "Having no one you know that smokes anymore helps a lot, or a spouse that would kick your ass if s/he caught you."My mom got some pills from her doctor that made her sick when she smoked."For me it was excersizing. Go to the gym once a day 1-2 hours and also run 1-3 miles a day. I didn't immediately quit, but after getting in a routine of doing that, I'd say after a month, the desire to smoke just faded away. I never actually meant to quit. I don't smoke ciggarrettes anymore. I had been a moderate to heavy smoker for maybe 5-7 years.   I will still have the occassional pipe though when drinking with my friends.  

However, my Dad quit when he met my mother by chewing on toothpicks when he wanted to have a ciggarrette. He's almost 60 years old now and to this day he still chews on toothpicks, but he doesn't smoke. Worked for him. ""Statistically speaking, I should be a life long smoker.  

I started when I was about 13.  I quit over 6 years ago, when I was about 25.  

Nicotine replacement therapy worked OK the first time I tried to quit, but what really ended up working was replacing one addiction for another: exercise.  I started rock climbing four nights a week at a gym and it gave me as much of an endorphin buzz as cigarettes did.  

The thing is, you really have to WANT to quit.  In order for that realization, you need to be very very aware of the idea that your behavior is now beyond your control.  It isn't you, it's the desire of ""the addiction"" (for me, it worked to personify it, as something/someone to beat).  

Until you don't really want to quit, you won't.""Wanting to quit, guilt over lying to my wife about how much I actually smoked, and the sweet, sweet lozenges.  God bless the lozenges. Quit those a month after, and now I'm two years smoke free in April.""It didn't last, but I quit for about 100 days by saving the money from my pack a day habit and some nicotine lozenge use. I also kept toothpicks in the car for the hand to mouth thing. Took a trip with the money to start a big tattoo, got back with some severe sleep depravation and thus weakened will power. Mix that with a few too many beers, boom started smoking again.

I suppose now I'm waiting for that magic moment of willpower again, obviously I'm capable of doing it. It does not help that my wife is a smoker as well, so we mutually enable each other. I also got a promotion at work, so there's a little more money coming in. But still, $700 extra in 100 days is no joke.""Truthfully I think I was never %100 addicted, despite smoking a pack a day for about 5 years at my peak of use.  The physical withdrawal during the first 3 days or so was a bitch, but after that point I had no real cravings.

The reason I quit was because I was having trouble swallowing food while eating.  I think my throat was either drying out or beginning to close up from the smoking.  I may have been developing a nicotine allergy.""Just accepting the fact that I had an addiction and that I was going to feel like crap for a little bit going through withdrawals really helped me. Yeah you may know that you smoke but I dont think many of us actually realize the extent of being an addict is even if it is just cigarettes. I also came to the realization that everything around me was controlled by how and when I was going to smoke again so I got pissed at my addiction to, the control it had on me, I refused to let it anymore. I am almost 2 years into my quit date and I can honestly say I  still crave it but I would never start smoking again because that would mean I was moving backwards in life. Stay strong and always tell yourself you are going to quit even if you arent ready. ""I quit for my wife. Looking back it was the best decision I've ever made. Yeah, I should have quit for myself but I wasn't going to. Deciding to do something with her in mind locked me into a ""no failure"" zone and I knocked it out. I still miss the occasional pipe or cigar, but I'm glad I shook the cigs and I'm thankful for any time that perhaps I've been able to add to my marriage."I quit for the final time a little over a month ago.  I'm a Registered Nurse and took care of a patient with severe COPD around Christmas time.  This patient would turn purple if their head was at any less than 60 degrees.  I'm also in my early 30s and thought it was rediculous that I was SOB from shoveling snow.  So I just didn't buy any more cigs and went on the patch.Pregnancy. "As someone who still smokes, and has tried unsuccessfully about 4 times now, out of all the various advices I've gotten throughout the years I've noticed the single most important key is: willingness. You have to want it, not just sort of but completely, 100%. Unfortunately, my cravings outweigh the want/need to quit smoking. But I think there's no wrong way or right way to quit smoking, and when the time comes for me to truly need/want to quit smoking I will be able to suffer through it entirely. Those around me who were successful and those that offered advice all had been willing to ""bleed"" for it, even if their methods were night and day. ""I did the laser treatment about 3 years ago and it was fantastic. I had tried to quit a number of times before, cold turkey, gradually, champix, and zyban, none worked. 
I set a date for the appointment about a week ahead of time, so I planned my whole day around rewarding myself. I went and got a massage after, had a nice lunch, a bit of shopping and a nap.
Also my now-husband told me he would never marry me as long as I smoked, so that was an incentive! "Just for the record the two methods here I've seen most are cold turkey and e-cigs. Interesting. E-cig FTW "It took me over 20 times to actually quit, just don't stop quitting...going to the gym is what helped me, very good outlet for the anger and anxiety of coming off and staying off smoking. Plus you surround yourself with positive healthy people."Never quit quitting. As long as you keep trying you will likely succeed; if that is what you really want."As a smoker for 25+ years I tried and failed many times. I set a date and told anyone who would listen. ""I am quitting on 2009-10-11"". I made an appointment for laser acupuncture to ease the cravings. Over the three days after I quit I drank an unreal amount of water to flush my system. I also sat in the Sauna to speed up the detox period. This seemed to help with the withdrawal... 
Over the summer there was a time when Nicotine took its hold on me 
again but after a trip to Nashville I said enough is enough.

You truly just have set your mind to it! The cravings never go away! If I get a few beers deep them I crave a smoke. Just have to ignore it. Sometimes I see someone smoking and I say my gawd that smoke looks incredible. But them the girls who sits next to me at work comes back from break and I say No Thank you cuz she smells like a pile of dog shit.

Just need to set your mind to it and find something to occupy your time
""I'm sixteen years a non-smoker after a 14-year habit. Quit a couple of times for about a year before quitting for good. 

The last time I was smoking a pack a day. I forced myself to imagine that each cigarette was killing me. With every inhalation, I visualized the smoke going into my lungs and killing me. 

Went on the patch for two weeks, until that made me sick, and yanked the patch off. Never smoked again. So, more or less, I went cold turkey and you likely should, too. Just flat out quit. Stick it out for three days, then stick it out a week. Each day, just make it until the end of that day without smoking.

If you fail, try again. Don't quit trying to quit.""vape, specifically the inferno model from volcanoecigs.com""Honestly, i stopped making excuses, and stopped buying/lighting cigarettes. I wish there was a magical answer, but honestly, show some fucking self control. ""It was the icing on the cake for me. I had just lost 100 pound, ran a marathon, moved out and moved on from a period in my life. I kind of just phased it out. After I ran my second marathon in almost 40 minutes faster time I knew I made the right choice. 

It was really a matter of phasing it out of my daily routines and not associating events like after meals and driving with them. 
 Still crave em when I'm drunk though but haven't smoked one in over 3 years""Setting a limit per day for yourself and gradually coming down to none. Worked for me, the last few days  I used to smoke 1 per day. Smoking one less is a lot of progress and you've got to tell yourself that. ""I know this sounds smug, but the truth is you have to stop smoking.  Just walk away from it.  Decide to quit and then don't smoke any more.  That's what I did 15 years ago.""I was introduced to someone at a bar while I was smoking.  He said, ""you're a doctor and you smoke?! Do you realize how dumb you look?""  In that moment, I did.  Haven't bought a pack since because I would feel stupid.  That was October 24, 2013.  BTW, I'm also a certified smoking cessation counselor (part of the curriculum in pharmacy school) but I knew it was all crap (for me at least).""A full blown asthma attack where I thought I was on my way over to the other side. It was the only motivation that worked for me. I still hanker after the odd ciggy, but the fear of that moment stops me in my tracks. ""Mine is nothing too special, smoked from 18-20 and I started seeing wrinkles, stains on teeth, really didn't like where it was going so I quit cold turkey.  A few weeks later I had a cigarette and it tasted awful, made me cough and I knew I was done after that.""Hating it, hating myself for doing it, hating the way it made me feel, both physically and emotionally. I'd stop, then I'd have the odd one, then I'd convince myself I was a casual smoker but before long I was lighting up as soon as I was awake. Most recently I decided to do 'Stoptober' I just wanted to do the month with no tobacco and no nicotine substitute, the only thing I allowed myself was to smoke pure weed in a pipe. I did the month, then I decided to do until new year, I did that and now I aim to do a full year, one step at a time. I still enjoy a pipe of weed and I know that has its risks but I'm not now chemically addicted to smoking, I frequently work abroad, as i am now, often for weeks on end, I can't take the weed with me then, but it's no problem, I just look forward to a nice toke by the fire when I get back home to my rural English country cottage. Ah. ""A lot of great advice here! Only thing I haven't seen yet is STICK WITH IT!!! And no I dont mean the cigarettes haha. I see so many people put up an honest fight to stop smoking and better their lives. They slip up, drag or two here and there, smoke one at a party, then bam they go out and buy a pack and its like theyve never even stopped. You have to know that its okay to slip up and to make mistakes, but the best thing you can do is realize that's not what you want (which will get easier and easier as you go on...) and continue on with your life. ""Champix - was easy. After 2 weeks I was forgetting to take the Champix pill and still not wanting a smoke. Over five years since I have smoked
""The look on my father's face when he would wake up gasping for breath in the middle of the night, unable to speak.  The panicked flailing was almost as bad. 

It was like watching a drowning victim.  Absolute terror in his eyes... I quit cold turkey. He quit a few years later after his lung capacity was something like 10%.  

He skirted death and now lives on the edge.  Some smokers never get cancer, but the reduced lung capacity you can't dodge.


Edit: smoked a pack a day for almost 5 years.  Had zero withdrawal and no physical cravings.  The psychological craving never went away though.

10 years later I started vaping. It's great and harmless(if you do your research), win win.""I'm not sure if I've quit but last time was 2 months with the help of zonnic gum. I went from the 4mg to the 2mg and eventually stopped altogether. Unfortunately I also go to bars frequently and my friends smoke like I did so I started back up. About 6 mo later I'm back on zonnic and haven't been smoking a little over a month. Partly price, partly not wanting to bum cigarettes out, and mostly not taking 3m breaks between sets at the gym""Honestly, I decided to just quit cold turkey and not be a bitch. If you want to quit smoking just do it and don't be a bitch about it. Man up. You can do it.""Well I quit 2 months and 3 weeks ago. I had been trying for a year prior to finally accomplish the task. Pure determination, coffee, and the want to be a healthier person; I believe in garbage in garbage out and have been using this idea to change as a person. ""I smoked a pack a day for 10 years and was coming back from a week long trip to China and got VERY sick. I was out for 4-5 days and didn't/couldn't smoke during that time. I took the opportunity of the forced break from smoking to simply quit. Was so fucking hard, but I haven't had a cigarette in almost 2 years now. I have a cigar like once every 3 months or so now. The hardest part is making the decision, but once you commit, take pride in your achievement.  "From what I've been skimming through: Someone you truly care about or vapes are the way to go! "I quit smoking/chewing tobacco for myself. Started around 16 or 17 in high school and I ended up telling myself I would be done with this shit at 25 and I stuck to my guns. Fast forward to New Years day the year after I turned 25, I stopped cold turkey and haven't gone back. ""Started with 15, said to myself id stop on my 25th birthday. And that's what I did, just stopped. I can not explain why or how it worked, I was a medium heavy smoker with about a 20 piece pack a day. Smoked my last cigarette in a vacation at midnight when my birthday started and haven't touched a cigarette since then. 

Got fat though. ""You have to want to quit, I had tried to quit multiple times but I in the end it came down to me not really wanting to. One day my girlfriend told me that I couldn't quit if I wanted to and I set out to prove her wrong. I have now not smoked a cigarette since 3/1/13. I had smoked everyday for 10yrs prior... It's crazy how much better you feel & how much stronger your immune system gets after quitting. I can now take a deep breath and not cough my lungs up, that's a first since freshmen yr of high school.""It's honestly all in your head, once you realize that it's a cake walk. It was for me at least."I Quit burning the analogue death sticks and switched to a e-cig. weened my self off of that in 6 months."My dad quit smoking on accident, and he has the hatred of thousands for that. 

He had strep throat, and according to him every time he took a drag off of a cigarette it felt like he was inhaling glass. So, he stopped smoking while he healed up. One week passed, and he figured, eh, might as well go for two. Then a month. Then two months. Then a year. 

He hasn't smoked a cigarette in a decade and a half.""I've tried to quit a number of times in the past.  Every other time I've allowed myself to cheat.  I'd justify just one drag cause I was drunk, or just one cig on a long trip, or I'd use an ecig.  I think that vapeing is just another excuse for smokers trying to quit.  

I'm too far into quitting again, but I feel different this time.  I decided I was going to quit, threw my cigs away, and haven't REALLY wanted to smoke again since then.  There was something different about my decision this time.  And since I didn't take any halfway measures, I'm further away from picking it up again.  ""I stopped smoking because of a cultural experience that I had with Brazil.  The basis was weaning off from regular smoking to only smoking socially.  However, I was able quit cold turkey after being in Beirut, Lebanon and smoking A LOT in four days and everyone smoked a lot and then going to Brazil where I barely smoked an no one smoked.  I really like both cultures but the culture experience + the beach culture and the beautiful bodies in Brazil somehow tipped the scales for me to stop smoking completely.  I have not smoked since I returned from Brazil.  It has been 4 years.  GO TO BRAZIL.  Maybe it will help.

I couldn't possibly light up a smoke in front of friends and family after that proclamation. Also, leave your smokes places where it is inconvenient to get them. Right after you have a smoke you won't be so worried about leaving them in the car. But then it becomes more and more of a pain in the ass to have a cigarette. Also, find out what your ""staple"" smokes are, and try conquering them first. I would light one while i was still in bed when I woke up in the morning. I would just force myself to wait an hour after I woke up before I had a smoke. Then 2 hours and so on. Keep your smoking habits, just without the smoke. I would still go stand out in the cold for 10 minutes chewing a tooth pick and then my electric cigarette. Then the spell was finally broken.""Hey, it's never gona be easy and there really is no magic solution. Obviously, you've heard that one before. BUT.

I know everybody that knows about Chantix says it gave them nightmares and made them depressed but that's what worked with me, well that and some will power. I kind of just went to a smoking cessation class just for the hell of it and they prescribed Chantix to me. While I was on it there were times that I would be smoking and not even know why because I wasn't getting the buzz or the satisfaction from the cigarette, and I had to downgrade to light cigarettes. But they ask you to pick a day to stop and mine happened to be on Mothers Day. I had taken my wife out for breakfast and we had a pretty big meal, and one of my favorite things to do when I smoked was to do it after a meal. Man that was probably the worst day ever. Because the reality set in that everything I liked to do while smoking wasn't going to be the same and I got super depressed and aggravated. It's hard and even 7 years later I still get the occasional urge to want to smoke, because it never really goes away, I would never go back. Best of luck to you in whatever you find that works for you.""Do you have a good reason not to smoke? Like, a very personal reason? A family member who has died of heart attack/emphysema/cancer? Personally suffering from chronic bronchitis? Those were my personal reasons.

Do you have positive alternatives to fill the gap in your life when cigs are no longer there? Not an ecig, but something actually good? Ever wanted to learn yoga or Tai Chi? Ever thought about running a 5K?

Working in healthcare seems to be a trigger enough for some reason. I see more employees smoking outside hospitals than most other places of work. Stressful job, I suppose. 

You'll have to find your own way. I had to decide I didn't want to always cough up phlegm, and that emphysema would be my final reward, just like it was for my grandfather, and my uncle. I also decided to get back into meditation-infused martial arts, and cleansing my body was a positive incentive. I had even relapsed once a few years back for a couple of weeks, and last couple of years I fooled myself into smoking a cigar or a pipe once a week. But not having cigs for a daily, hourly habit was helpful in cutting that shit out and getting straight again.

He said is was a hassle to smoke when it was so cold outside. He noticed that he would smoke less and less month after month since the temperature dropped to -15 C. 
TL;DR: Move to Alaska

""What helped me quit was my absolute desire to stop smoking. It's really hard when part of you wants to continue. I came back from lunch one day and sat down at my desk at work, looked at the pack of cigarettes in my hand, and then tore them all up and threw them away. I haven't touched them in a year and a half. This was after a decade of smoking. ""I lost my old friends, got new (non-smoking) friends. ""Chantix.

Usually you are on it for 6 months but I was a bad case so I took it for a whole year. I am now 7 years off cigs.""It's been 3 weeks since my last Cig and I have been using Nicorette. By no means do you get a buzz off of it, but it helps tremendously to ease cravings. If you want to quit I recommend the gum.""Persistence, I failed more than 20 times.

The first few days were always the hardest, so eventually I just got so fed up with going through those first 3 days that I realized the dichotomy that was in front of me:  The only way to never go through those first 3 days again is to NEVER smoke, or smoke until you die of lung disease, and even then you'll probably be *forced* to go through it when you are dying.

I used the patch to help the first few days and did my best to not think of smoking in any way, every time I got a craving I tried to focus on anything else, ignoring that the craving was there.  The cravings got less and less frequent and eventually completely went away.  This march will be 6 years.""I became pregnant.  I knew that I didn't want to be selfish and jeopardize my baby's future for my own habit.  Hardest thing ever, and I still have ""cravings"" long after the nicotine has left my body, more reminiscing about the social factor, but so far that has been the only thing that worked for me."My dad switched to electronic cigarettes and said they are just as good for his addiction. But then he has also been breathing better and his room smells better too."I was fortunate enough to just not like it, so it never occurred to me to even try it. I picked one off the floor when I was 5 and puffed it. It was such a terrible feeling especially the next day when I couldn't even speak. The subconscious fear just prevented me from even temptation to try it.""Isolation.

When ever I feel like I need a smoke I have a drag. I also wanted to quit which really helps! - not enough just doing it because you should rather because you want to"Stop buying. Bumming off of friends makes you feel real shitty about it. "honestly, i was taking an early flight to San Fransisco for work. It was a 6am flight or something, in October, and I was at the airport at 4:30. It was rainy, cold, dark and gross outside and I was fucking exhausted, but before I could go through security, I knew I wouldn't be able to smoke for a bit so I had a cigarette in the smokers area in the rain.  I felt like such an idiot becuase the last thing I wanted to be doing was to be standing out in the rain at 4:30am at the airport, but this foreign thing, these fucking cigarettes, were making me do it.  I dunno.. i felt so gross and miserable and disgusted in myself that this thing that is poisoning me had that much control over my life. right then and there, I threw out my pack, and haven't looked back since. I had initial cravings which I stemmed by ""allowing"" myself to smoke a cigar. that happened a bit in the beginning, but I hate cigars in reality, so it just petered out naturally after that, and I haven't looked back. That was October 2012 I think. 

TLDR: it was pretty much cold turkey, out of shame and disgust. also smoked an occasional cigar during cravings but now have no interest whatsoever""I tried to go cold turkey and tried nicotine replacement a few times. What finally got me to stop was just to decide ""This is it. I am done."" I did research on how to mentally prepare myself to quit. I bought my first e-cig and when I learned how to use the e-cig, I decided I was finished. 

I had work related habits too. Certain breaks triggered me to smoke. The morning coffee and a smoke was crazy for a few days. What really helped was changing what I did. Instead of doing what I always did on a break, I did something else. In the mornings, I changed my routine and I changed my night time routine as well. "Easy-quit method by Alan Carr"i just quit and started running and hiking, never looked back.""Next time you get a really bad sinus/respiratory infection, quit.

I found it was a lot easier to stop, when smoking already made me feel sick. Not to mention you already feel ill and have the time off work (hopefully). ""Honestly I smoked Marlboro reds for over and year, one day I ran out and just never picked up any more. It never really clicked, luckily. I'm not denying that quitting smoking is easy, I know it is not. 
Just me personally, I never became addicted to it.

Someone else I know who smoked for 20+ years stopped smoking because of a storm that prevented them from getting more smokes, so they just endured it for those days. 
Again, I'm **not** trying to downplay addiction and cigarettes, as everyone knows they are extremely addictive. ""Honestly, for me it was seeing withered old women still smoking. Not so glamorous when you're 80 ""Smoked a pack a day + hash + pot. Then came Cycling. Seeing improvements daily when you quit keep you going. When you smoke even one cigarette you feel it heavily on your lungs and legs in that dayå«s ride. I am convinced that running would also help. Any kind of measurable exercise dependent on cardio and performance-oriented, actually. One year going strong. The first week of quitting is the worst of it, in my case. I came to realize that itå«s mostly a mind game : you vs yourself , or your willpower vs addiction. Constant excuses to smoke will come to your head : ""just one"", ""itå«s pot not a cigarette, does not count"", ""just tonight"", ""only when I drink"", etc. Thatå«s addiction speaking.  Just as an ex-alcoholic cannot drink, not even a little bit, you cannot smoke. Not just one cigarette, not a puff, not a joint, nothing. Habits and Skills are developed, vices are cut off.""Now I know this is not for everyone however I **just stopped**.  Now,  I was a smoker for about... 7 years. ""I'd been trying to quit for months. For some reason I made a terrible habit of smoking while driving. Whenever Id get in my car, I'd light one up. And depending how far my destination was I'd go through 3 or 4 back to back. I found that if I put the cigg in my hand without lighting it while driving that helped. It was just the habit of having it in my hand while driving. This cut out a lot of smoking for me. I recently moved to a city where I don't need my car so I didn't bring it with me. I quit cold turkey my first day here because I haven't driven at all. It's been over a month now. Pretty sure if I drove somewhere now Id be way too concerned about how to drive in snow. ""My wife doesn't smoke so when we got married I wanted to quit. I had tried unsuccessfully before so I told her I wanted her help. Having a teammate is the best thing. A non-smoker who can be supportive and encouraging. She would pack little baggies full of hard candy and chewing gum for me to take to work every day. We would talk every day about how bad the cravings were, and if I smoked at all that day or not. If I did smoke, she wasn't judgmental but instead looked at the positive. If I smoked only two that day, for instance,  but I smoked three the day before, she would congratulate me on smoking one less than yesterday. And the best piece of advice I can give you is to stay away from bars for a while and try to avoid hanging out with friends that smoke for the first couple of weeks. After the first three weeks it gets easier. Good luck!!!""I quit cold turkey and drank seltzer water to get that burning feeling in my throat that makes a cigarette so satisfying. I drank a lot of seltzer. 

I also accepted that bad things would happen and I couldn't use such things as a reason to pick them back up. You have to remember, even when you're sad or drunk or whatever, that you chose to quit and the temporary circumstances you're in cannot alter your long term preference to be a non smoker.

I haven't had a smoke in 10 months. Regardless of what you do, quit using the electronic ones, as they're just a temporary solution. Good luck!""I had wanted to quit for about 6 months and couldn't. One day I popped a few hits of LSD and in the impressionable state I threw my pack away and never touched one again.
I've read study's with psychedelics helping alcoholics too.""Sounds like you're the same as me.

I was on Cigs for about 7 years, then onto E-Cigs and regular, then off all, then on E-Cigs, then off.. now back on.

Here's the main thing I've found that helps. With E-Cigs, the drag or 'feel' isn't as strong as a regular cig, so curious enough, is it the strength that you miss? The social feel? 

Here's the main thing, E-Cigs are EASIER to quit than regular smoking, at least for me. Get a higher quality setup for your E-Cig that provides the Nicotine that you need to draw you to IT rather than the smoke. Mold your E-Cig into what you want, what will help you quit. Once you're onto that only, fantastic, you've done a great thing. After that comes full quitting, but focus on one thing at a time.""I switched over to the electronic cigarettes with the expectation of quitting, and I would only have the electronic cigarette if I got a craving.  This was a stepping stone, and now if I go out I will bring the electronic cigarette with me (just in case I get tempted while I am drunk).  Otherwise, no smoking for me for over a year now."Reading the Book of Mormon and Cinnamon mouth wash.A friend of a friend wanted to quit smoking so my friend made him eat an entire pack of cigarettes filter and all.

The cravings went away after about 2-3 months, and now even if I am drinking or at work, I have no interest in cigarettes. The smoke actually makes me sick to my stomach when my fiancee smokes now.. Trying to get her to make the leap as well, but she isn't as good with self control as I am. She has tried ""cutting back"" but I feel like that is the worst way to quit. Just shut it down, and never go back to it. You have to be determined.""I stopped smoking cold turkey about 2 years ago. I had a bunch of cigarette packs sitting next to my bad and I just never opened them anymore, looking at them was sort of helpful to think about how they had no power over me. 

Lots of things contributed to me finally quitting, but the number one thing was that I was lying to a woman that I had quit (I was overseas.) As the deployment was winding down I knew I was going to have to see her again so I stopped.""I chain smoked for an entire weekend in New Orleans, made myself super sick, and couldn't even think about a smoke for a couple of weeks, by which time I figured I might as well try to keep going.

I think most people realise they need to quit or at least think about it a lot,  that's a good start,  I think a genuine desire to quit,  willpower,  is an essential element. 

In a nutshell,  start doing some kind of fitness exercise,  for me it was boxing.  Nothing like wheezing and coughing up your lungs in a deep sweat to make you realise what you've done to your lungs all those years.  That will help keep you motivated as you notice your fitness improve.

Furthermore start reading Alan Carrs book, which I've no doubt had already been mentioned elsewhere.  I know what you're thinking ""how can a book stop me.smoking??"" But just read the damn thing and it will become clear.  I didn't read it until I was already a good 6-8 weeks in,  but it certainly helped reinforce the intent and give final control over the urge to regress.""Not me, but someone I know smoked for 40 years and finally quit using Chantix.

The truth is I ""quit"" several times before I really quit, every time for some reason other than I really wanted to quit and each time I went back to smoking. One time I hadn't smoked in over a year! I finally decided that I really wanted to quit, not for my family, friends, or finances but because I didn't want to smoke any more. 

I quit buying them and stayed away from places that sold them. I bought all my gas with pay at the pump then immediately left the had station. I had my wife do ALL the shopping so I was never in Walmart out grocery stores. The final thing was staying away from smokers while they were smoking. This was hard but absolutely necessary for me to quit successfully.   I explained to my friends that I couldn't be around then when they smoked and to NEVER GIVE ME A CIGARETTE AGAIN no matter what I said. 

It's been 2 years since I have smoked and I don't remember why I ever did. ""Flu helped. Also smoking as much as I wanted but always from a different pack, so I had reds, lights and menthol. Lots of coughing and nausea, conditioned my body to hate it. No smoking for 2 years.""For me, it was my wife getting pregnant.  Never was a heavy smoker, but I always had the desire to quit.  Once I got the news, I quit on the spot.  I've had occasional cheat moments (2-3 cigs in 2 years), but never really went back.  To sum up what others have said, you have to want to do it for yourself (not just say it) or find something that you care about more than yourself (kids for me) to motivate you.""chantix. I took it and didn't really follow directions, then just forgot to smoke. Eventually i forgot to take the chantix, so it kind of worked itself out.""My parents used Chantix, they haven't smoked in 4 years.

Hated them with a passion(Menthols not the females), and also I hated when i would of previously had a piece of gum in my mouth, and then having a smoke. So it was a no brainer to spend the 7 or so bucks on a sleeve of Excel Gum and literally chew them constantly, and also surrounding yourself with non smokers for the time being. I can now be around my buddies even while they are smoking.""I don't think I was ever really addicted to cigarettes. I smoked when I was out walking, or drinking. Not generally casually. I didn't leave my place for a cigarette break, it was really just a way for me to busy my hands outside... so this definitely doesn't apply to all smokers.

I decided I would quit smoking weed and cigarettes at the same time. I quit cold turkey, but instead of throwing the pack out, I placed them on my mantle. I kept them there for six months. For me, it allowed me to continue to make a choice. It wasn't as if I didn't have cigarettes, they were right there... so the whole ""I would buy a pack if I had the money"" argument was out the window. There they were, if I wanted them.

But I didn't... and the choice to look at them but not smoke them was strengthening.

For me, it worked very well. I started smoking weed again after realizing there... really is no health related reason to quit, unless you're smoking to avoid your issues. It doesn't help.

I still smoke cigarettes when I go to the bar. I have one or two with one or two beers about once a month... and honestly, even that is becoming undesirable. I can only smoke those cherry and vanilla flavored cigarillos because regular smokes smell horrible to me now.

For me, I'm comfortable with this. I think everything in moderation is fine. I don't feel a need to smoke, I simply want to, once in a while.

"Chantix. I started taking it for a week because others around me said it worked for them but gave them weird dreams. I took it for a week and during the first few days I had really vivid and strange dreams and I was aloud to smoke the first week but by the seventh day I found that I had laid/slept around for 16 hours that day feeling depressed. I stopped taking the Chantix and stopped smoking the next day and have not had one for over a well over a year now."you have to get to a place mentally where you do not want to smoke anymore.  a buddy of mine who helped me quit, said think of putting a cock in your mouth .  how badly do you not want to do that.  find that same place with smoking and you'll never do it again.  that was 4 years ago.  never a puff since with no other help ""You know, I swear I don't remember why I quit.  I just remember quitting cold turkey from one day to the next.  Then again I've quit drugs like that too so I don't know."Currently smoke and have been contemplating putting away the darts.

The one thing that made me quit smoking was having a heart attack and triple bypass at 31 years old in part due to my smoking. After that it was pure willpower to quit, no gimmicks. "E-cigs."Realising the only cigarette that tastes good and has an effect is the first one. The others are just a mixture of beeing bored, habbit and as an excuse to go outside to take a break. Not worth overall."" 
I smoked for 8 years, and for the first six I smoked Camels. I chain smoked and was very addicted. The last two years I smoked (year and 5 months really) I switched to machine rolled cigarettes. The tobacco used is pipe tobacco with nothing added other than a mild preservative. The tubes do not contain fire safe chemicals, which is what puts your cigarette out if you don't puff on it for a minute or two. All manufactured cigarettes contain this chemical as required by law and is equivalent to carpet glue.

The last time I smoked was during a phone call to my insurance company. Shortly after, I took a pregnancy test and it was positive. I haven't smoked a cigarette since. Going cold turkey wasn't hard at all and five months after having the baby I still haven't smoked one cigarette, despite occasional cravings and temptations. Not being addicted to all those chemicals is what made it possible for me, I truly believe that. Additionally, after I started rolling my own, I had no intention to quit but I cut way back and was able to kick my oldest smoking habit which was smoking in the car. Oh, how I loved to smoke and smoke in the car.

The main reason so many people struggle to quit is because they are addicted to the chemicals and additives put in the cigarettes they are smoking, even more so than the nicotine itself. There are several hundred extra chemicals, poisons and preservatives added to all manufactured cigarettes that are extremely addictive. This was kept secret by big tobacco but is public knowledge now thanks to a whistle blower. You can do a simple Google search to find a list of all the fucked up shit they add to cigarettes.

I know a great deal about the shadiness of big tobacco because my family's business was directly affected by it. My boyfriend owns a head shop that started out as an RYO smoke shop, where customers used a machine to roll a carton for half the normal price. Long story short, the big tobacco industry shut down the growing RYO business through a multi million dollar lobbying agenda. When the machines stopped rolling, our customers had to go back to smoking Marlboros and American Spirits, etc. They very quickly began coughing and hacking on a regular basis again. They complained of the taste and of the cost, of course. It wasn't long before most bought their own rolling machines to roll at home, which is the least expensive way to smoke. 
I recommend you buy a home rolling machine, a bag of tobacco that matches what you usually smoke, and a box of tubes and start smoking those. It won't take long to get used to the difference in taste, which you will notice because you are so addicted to the distinct combination of chemicals you've been smoking for so long. Because let's be honest, when it comes to addiction, no matter what it is, you can't quit until you are really ready. So if you're going to keep smoking, then do it the cheapest, cleanest way possible, and in a way that won't benefit the big tobacco corporations, which are quite evil.

tl;dr I weaned myself off the extremely addictive chemicals added to cigarettes by rolling my own smokes before I quit cold turkey.
"Wacked back a beer every time I wanted a smoke"Shortly after my daughter told me that she hated that I smoked,I had a vision of me trying to dance at her wedding, wheeling around an oxygen tank. I told her I'd quit, but I needed her help.  Every day for two weeks, I'd take a pen to work, and for each cigarette I had, I'd put a tally mark on my wrist. At the end of each day, she'd count the marks and we'd put that day's number on the calendar.  We watched the number drop from 20 to 19 to 16 and so on. One day, I had more than the day before and the look on her face ensured that I'd never do that again. At the end of the two week period I was down to my last cig, which I had on the way in to watch a movie with her and her mother. 

Stepping down helped me out tremendously, as did carrying my smokes in a zip-lock bag to make it more of a pain in the ass to keep them on me. The deciding factor though, was about three days after my last cigarette, I had the worst craving of my life. I almost caved, but stopped by telling myself that if I had one, I'd be reliving that same craving later. ""I realized that smoking was purely in my head and just made the decision to, whenever my brain said ""hey, phil8show, you want a smoke"", I would just say ""fuck you brain, I'm better than this"". As much as people have said that that doesn't work, its the sticking to it that's the hardest because your brain does after all control you. It was hard but I did it cold turkey and now smoke knocks me sick. Best of luck man, I know you can do it!""I started smoking at 15 and quit at 19. i woke up one day, caughing like an 80yr old veteran who survived a nerv gas attack. i grabbed my pack of cigs - it was empty. i thought to myself ""well might as well buy some new cigUARGHCOGHCOUGHBRARGL!.."" and i ditched that ida. nowaday i only smoke cigarillos on special occasions (like sitting at a barbeque with friends on a nice summer evening) but those dont add up to 4 or more per year"Chewing gum. "Not recommending it, but my dad smoked for years in he army because it was something to past the time. He then saw his frieds kicking ass in college track and thought, ""I'd like to be able to do that."" He then waited till he had a bad head cold then smoked himself sick, throwing up and all. He couldn't touch the things afterwards. Sorta like the Garcia Effect for tobacco.""I spilled a spit bottle on my gaming pc.

I love my gaming pc.""I quit 8 Nov 12 after smoking for 26 years.  I have tired pills, patch etc.  But what has worked for me is Vaping.  for me and lot of a friends it works great !!
""Nobody is going to like this answer but the only thing that worked for me after several attempts trying different things was cold turkey with the determination that I was really done this time.  I want to smoke, but I know that I can't because it's bad for me.  You have to REALLY want to quit.  There is no magic pill that will give you the strong will to make it happen either.  ""Some things that helped me get through the tough times were a bowl of hard candy and also I bought a fish for my desk at work.  When I got the  real bad cravings, I fucked with the fish.  Feed it, clean the bowl, whatever.  It's been six months and I rarely get cravings.  I also started exercising right away and started a diet maybe 4 months after I quit.  I'm down 12lbs since I stopped smoking.""A collapsed lung.  I quit pretty quickly lol!  All joking aside.. I was truly surprised that my hardest moments were MONTHS after I went back to work.  It was the triggers.  Driving to work, outside with colleagues...

So my advice?  Distance yourself from the events that lead you to smoke.  ""I quit when I was 25, right after I met my wife. At that point, I had tried to quit multiple times, and failed each time.

What did it for me was not a single silver bullet, but a combination of things.

1. surroundings: The one place I smoked the most when I did was when I was out with friends at bars and clubs. After I met my wife, I started going a lot less.

2. support network: it's not quite like say, dealing with alcoholism, but a support network makes a huge difference. My wife was very anti-smoking, and I had recently moved to a new job. At my new job, I told everyone that I was an ex-smoker and I need help to stay off of it. Having people watching me kept me honest about this. 

3. motivation: this is the most important one. You need to really want to quit. For me, it was when I was imagining what would happen to me in my old age if I had smoked, and then realizing that having to live off of oxygen tanks is not a good way to live. The nasty pictures of people with lung cancer? That didn't do it for me. but watching what people who have it and see what they have to live with did it for me.""You probably have a ton of replies, but /r/stopsmoking really helped me a lot! ""I was in the middle of a shower. I was like ""I'm quitting"". I haven't had a drag since. It'll be 10 months on 2/8/14.""I just tried to replace the urge to smoke with other things.  Like working out, chewing gum....  But the biggest motivator was my girlfriend at the time, she said no sex if I smoke a cig, it was an easy decision, she is my wife now. "My mum quit when she had a grandson. I my wife attempted to quit many times but she actually succeed when when she wasn't trying. She just switched to an electric cigarette and gradually (over just a few months) she felt she needed it less."I was admitted to the hospital for emergency gall bladder surgery, then had to spend a week. Obviously was not allowed to smoke...""An electronic cigarette broke and I didnt feel like coughing up 20 bucks to get a new one. 

What started the e cig was the fact that I couldnt see my neice when she was born. She was a premature baby and couldnt be around me. I hated myself ""Chantix, which is the closest thing to magic you'll encounter.

However, beware the side effects. They're all true""My bother called me and told me he had gone to the hospital after coughing up some blood, and was awaiting test results.  I asked him to keep me posted, and called my mother to see how she was holding up.  Apparently, ""some"" blood was almost 3 liters.  I called my brother back, and after the ""WHAT THE FUCK?!"" conversation, he said I should quit.  I did.""Meds. Zyban (aka Wellbutrin) is like miracle.

**too short;want more**:

I smoked for about 7 years. I tried to quit a bunch of times, each lasting a few months at the most. I really hated it. I was a stinky feeble jackass.
Then I took wellbutrin (for depression) while seeing a therapist.

I was still allowed to smoke. I smoked as much as I wanted in fact. But after a few weeks I didn't want to smoke anymore. Just didn't care if I did it or not, and since I knew I wanted to stop I just stopped, no biggie. I stayed on wellbutrin for a few months after I stopped smoking, and when I went off I never started smoking again.

Wellbutrin has side-effects. It gave my dick a hair-trigger that really dissappointed my girlfriend. But some people get the opposite effect. Or none. There's no way to tell how you'll react unless you try it. 

I recommend. "I had a daughter. Nothing sobered me up quite like being around an infant. It was HARD work! But... I went cold turkey."After ten years of smoking I decided I want to quit. Partially to save more money, partially to be healthier and to make a huge change in my life. I did nothing like switch to e-cig or smoking less and less day by day. I just tried to quit over night. So far 13 months passed and I'm feeling good.""Being mad enough at cigarettes for having more control over my life than I did.  Supplemented the hard times with Nicorette but didn't follow their program.

Tried a million times.  Last time worked.  3.5 years. ""Chewing on straws and three buckets of Sunflower seeds... I ate soup a lot when I realized what o had done like two or three weeks in, but I quit damn it!""Start only smoking a half a cig at a time and put the reburn back in ur pack every time. By the time you smoked 20 half cigs and have 20 reburns in the pack, the smell will start making you nautious.  That helped me quit. Also its a decision you have to make and stick to. Mabe calculate how much you spend on smoking a year, how much youll save. These things helped me.""Don't use the electronic ciggarette, stop blaming it on the nicotine, the withdrawals are not bad at all.  It's all social cues and boredom, if you can last all day tomorrow do that, only smoke late at night a few times and it will slowly make the whole process less enjoyable.  Again though, stop with the E-Cig, your probably more addicted now from that thing.""I was never able to quit until I met my current girlfriend. She was around a group of smokers the first time we went out for drinks and made it pretty clear how she felt about cigarettes. I went cold turkey the next day. I've tried using electronic cigarettes in the past, but they just never seem to help. I just try to convince myself that it is the single worst habit that a person can have. ""Tried e-cigs, got bored and just quit. I smoked 20 a day but I don't think I was ever really addicted as I could go without them easily. Just a case of getting out the habit.""I stopped smoking a few years ago after my friend made an observation:Not smoking is easy. You don't have to do *anything*. It's the absence of action. That stuck with me. Every time I craved a cigarette, I just thought to myself: ""Don't do it. Don't do anything. Just sit there and do nothing.""Of course there's the whole social aspect of it to tackle, but it got me started. Every time you slip up and start wanting to smoke, just do nothing instead. Doing nothing is easy. ""Everytime I talk about this on reddit I get downvoted to oblivion but ill say it anyway. 

I just quit. It's willpower, plain and simple. I wanted to quit for primarily financial reasons. I enjoyed smoking and if it weren't for the poor health effects and the money would gladly have continued forever. Firstly, it's cool. Second, it's socially beneficial. Third, it os a comfort in many situations. 

So I decided to quit. And I did for 6 months. Curious whether I could continue I tried smoking occasionally and eventually smoked more and more until I quit again a month later. 

I used no patches or chemicals or silly treatments I just made up my mind and did it like an adult with willpower. It worked great. 

People that can't quit either don't want to or they're incredibly weak people with no willpower in which case...well, I don't care what happens to them."I stopped hanging around my friends that smoked. It helps SO much. I also didnt let anyone smoke in my car etc. cause that was a trigger for me."Really, the best thing that I used to quit smoking was my own stubbornnes.

I'd tried several times (halfheartedly) to quit smoking, and was finally sick of myself. Sick of feeling awful. Sick of coughing all the time. Sick of the heavy feeling on my chest every morning. So one day, early December 2005, I decided to quit.

I spent an entire month thinking of the nastiness of cigarettes. Everytime I took a drag, I thought of how awful it smelled. I looked at the discoloration on my hands. I noticed how the taste lingered and got progressively worse and worse. Every day for that month, I convinced myself of it's nastiness. I just festered on the very idea of cigarettes, pointing out every single thing to myself that I found mildly irritating... and by the end of the month, I found each and every one of these things absolutely REVOLTING.

At the beginning of January, I got some smoking cessation patches. They were hard at first, and gave some really weird dreams, but I constantly reminded myself of the benefits of using them. Do I smell like cigs? Nope! Are my fingers discolored? Nope! Does my chest hurt? Nope!

It was the hardest thing I've done in my life... but it's also the best thing. I've watched friends and family try to quit, to no avail, and the only difference I've seen between what I did and what they do is my introductory ""begin the hate"" period.



""I used to work in X-ray and would see a lot of good X-rays that made me want to quit. But I never did. Then I saw an ultrasound of someone's carotid arteries and how clogged and gross they were and that made me quit for 6 months it was gross. But I started smoking again. It has been 4 months for me and it was pure will power. Mind over matter. When I got in situations that made me want to smoke I had to take a step back and ponder if it was really worth it, and to this day nothing has been worth going back."I've heard of a good shrooms trip mitigating the desire to smoke. I think it's the psilocybin that negates nicotine cravings. (Maybe someone can find a source). Best of luck to you. I know you will pull it off."When I was smoking daily, I preferred to use long cut rolling tobacco and licorice coated rolling papers.  It gave a nice heavy smoke, and the slight sweetness was quite enjoyable.  This is relevant to the outcome of the story.

One day, I was craving sweets. I served myself a big bowl of ice cream and sprinkled some fun dip powder over the top. I was delicious, it absolutely hit the spot. Needless to say, after finishing my desert, I went out to have a smoke. I rolled up one of my tasty licorice smokes, and lit it up.  

Well, that slight sugary sweetness in the licorice paper put me past the tipping point. My blood sugar spiked and I got really sick. I found myself doubled over on the floor feeling like absolute shit. That was it for me... 

I quit smoking that day. At least, I quit smoking daily. I have a tobacco pipe that i smoke maybe 2-3 times each month and occasionally I'll have a cigarette after a good lay if my partner is having one.""Lollipops. 

I used to carry around pockets full of (eventually sugar free) lollipops. Anytime I needed a cig I had a lollipop. After a while I used toothpicks, then nothing. Trust me when I say that after 2 weeks you will feel like you can actually do it. The urge never really goes away but the crave does.

Plus, everyone likes lollipops so it was an awesome icebreaker. If someone asks you and you tell them you're carrying em cos you're trying to quit, it's a great way to start a convo.""I separated myself from people who smoke. When I didn't see or interact with people who smoked cigarettes, I didn't want them anymore.

Demand a break without smoking cigarettes. For your boss to enforce something like that is criminal.""I've been a month free of smoking as of today. I started when I was 16, and I realized that I didn't want to hit the 10 year mark. I tried the patch, but that made me extremely nauseous. I tried chantix, but that made me vomit every day so I stopped that quickly. Back in December I decided to stop my anxiety medication, because I felt it was doing more harm than good. It was an incredibly rough time. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't focus on anything. I decided to have a cigarette and it made all of my symptoms ten times worse. I quit cold turkey that day. Haven't looked back.  
You have to find what will work for you,  but eventually you will find it and you will quit,  and you will feel the best you've ever felt in your life. ""I got appendicitis, and after the surgery, I found myself in the hospital bed NOT fiending for a cigarette so i took advantage and quit for life. (The addiction was the reason I tried and failed to quit so many times, felt like I got a free pass.)""""Smoking is easy, I've done it hundreds of time."" - Mark Twain  

This was true in my life. I have quite many times. Many, many times. I also used chewing tobacco (I know, totally gross; I agree).

I'm now over two years without any nicotine. I have gone as long as 1.5 years before. I was able to start quitting with Chantix but I can attest personally that the side affects were harsh (even taking half dosage). I've also had luck with wellbutrin in the past.

Here's something I had to get in my thick, thick skull: Quitting smoking means no more cigarettes. Not one. Not ever. Never again. I know I cannot even have a drag. I am done. I do not smoke. I know this sounds simple but it's the best advice I can give.

Also, having a baby has been a huge help. I couldn't imagine smoking now. Obviously I don't mean around the baby but even having it on my clothes or hands; major nope.""I had quit for a year and a half up until recently. I have had a lot of medical issues and the stress from that caused me to go buy a pack. I didn't want to smoke in my new car so I went to this back parking lot where we all used to chill in high school. Let me tell you, that first drag of that menthol was glorious. An instant calm came over my body and it was so nostalgic because that's where we would often light up away from the adults. So it's been three weeks and I'm still smoking and I do feel guilty about it to be honest. For me, the only way to quit is cold turkey, and as a previous poster stated once your an addict, you carry that around for the rest of your life. I will quit again soon but for now I'm enjoying it for what it is.""I tried chantrix and it worked, but I had some very vivid very fucked up dreams as well as other side effects from it, so I stopped using it and quickly returned to smoking.  What eventually got me to stop though was finding out my uncle had prostate cancer( I know nothing to do with smoking ).  He is a total health nut, so I figured that If I kept smoking my chances were pretty grim if the healthiest 65 year old I know can still get cancer."A good E-cig. Been cigarette free for over a month.Took a two week stay in hospital for me to quit - I was confined to the ward and couldn't go outside to smoke so I went cold turkey. "You have to actually WANT to quit. Knowing you have to is helpful, but most never enough. 
I had it easy. I took advantage of a ""crappy"" tasting cigarette one day. I put it out halfway through, and decided I was done smoking. That was 13 years ago and I still don't smoke. 
I'm convinced it just happens when you're ready.""Chewing gum, not the nicotine type, just regular gum. Every time you want a cigarette just have a piece. ""Take yourself out of situations where you impulsively lit up. (break at work, drinking out with friends who smoke etc.). I tried the chantix, e-cig, chewed for a day lol. Ultimately though, it came down to me just making the choice that I didn't want to anymore. The hardest thing for me, is being at a bar with friends who are smokers.""I signed up for life insurance and as part of that said i wasn't a smoker, that forced me to stop smoking until the smoking test (blood test or maybe hair test). I kept putting the test off for 4 months and after that 4 months i didn't even want to smoke anymore...sorted. Now 2 years smoke free and couldn't care less :)

tl;dr life insurance stopped my addiction, I'm a cheap bastard.""I have to bike to classes, and I started having to stop biking sometimes and take breaks even though I was only biking for a mile.  Not being able to bike such a short distance was not at all worth having cigs every day.""My fiancee, now wife, told me she wouldn't marry me.  I quit cold turkey after that.  Scared the shit out of me. ""I quit and would come back to cigarettes. I would quit  and be able to stay off of them for increasing periods: 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 months. This occurred maybe 6 or 7 times over the course of a year or so interspersed with periods of heavy  smoking in te range of 2 PPD.

At the same time  there were some non physical reasons building up;
1.I found  a really nice dress that I really liked and dropped a lit ash in my lap in the car and burned a hole in the front of the skirt.I was real pissed off at myself for that
2. My  mom who has been smoking since before I was born had a bout of bladder cancer, caught early, but the doc attributed it to her smoking(Metabolites excreted in the urine were thought to be the trigger). That was scary
3.I am a trial lawyer. I had a doctor on the stand  from whom I really really wanted some helpful testimony. During a break I was smoking in the hallway and he asked if he could send me the smoking cessation materials he used. I  jumped  at the offer. They were just some pamphlets and stuff but it was something.
4. I broke up with a guy who was a heavy smoker and I met this guy  who I wanted to go out with but he was very clear that he never dated girls who smoke because he hated the smell. Bummer
5.I was playing around with a present cash value calculator and figured out how much money I would spend  over my anticipated life expectancy at the current price and current rate of smoking. It was a lot of money and this goes back a while. Hmmm.


So, Labor Day Weekend comes around. I   had again quit and  was  feeling in control. I had some friends over for a BBQ and thought I could have just one. Wrong. Finished the whole pack that  evening.

And then I never smoked again. Ever. Anything.

They didn't have electronic cigarettes. No gum, no pills, no hypnosis. Nothing. Very surprisingly,  what I missed was the inhalation. You can inhale without  smoke. I did that for a couple weeks and then gradually didn't need to do so any more.

My last cigarette was around 9:00 p.m. on September 5, 1981.

In retrospect, I was probably weaning myself from the nicotine dependence by the increasingly long periods I had quit before the last time.

Oh, yeah. When I quit cigarettes were 80 cents a pack.

Your failed attempts are still periods of time you are not smoking. Keep at it. 

""My kids were always bugging me to quit a went out of their way to inform on how bad i stunk. got sick of the coughing and labored breathing. 
I tried chantix, wellbutrin, Nic Gum and patches. none worked..

I swithced to an e-cig and thats what worked! it was more of going through the motions of smoking that kept me there. the habit and oral fixation. Went Cold turkey to using an e-cig for me got me about 80% of my Fix the other 20% was will power. but after about a month i knew i was in the clear. Almost 2 years later still cigarette free and enjoying my E-cig with 12mg of nicotine !""This is a serious post. I failed 3 time over about 6 years. Wasn't a very heavy smoker to begin with, at the peak mayby up to a pack every 3-4 days. I never had any triggers, like work or wakeing up in the mourning, or the last cig of the day. I NEVER smoked while driving. I wanter to quit, I stopped buying them, ended up buming them until i felt like a worthless POS. Then moved to dip for a month, and was done. ""I didn't smoke at home, since my husband never smoked.  Sometimes I'd smoke on the porch, but mostly I smoked in the car and on break at work.  So when I quit my job and wasn't driving or taking work breaks anymore, so it was easier to stop at that point.  ""The best way to quit is to change your mentality about smoking. If you do not make the cognitive change, you will relapse. It is something that is different for each person. Once you can throw the pack away and not think that it was hard, that is when you have gotten to the point.

Small things that help: After a week, you notice how terrible it smells when someone has musty smoke on them. Drinking carbonated beverages or alcohol is going to make things a lot harder (get started on drinking water). You are going to cough a bunch shortly after and that's actually a good thing; it means things are getting better.

Good luck.""I was a pack to a pack and 1/2 a day smoker for 15 years.  I quite by hypnosis.  My grandma who was a heavy smoker for 30years plus was the one who recommended it to me - that is how she quite.   It was the BEST investment I have ever made!!  I did some research and found a center with good reviews and a money back guarantee.  I worked the first time for a 2 weeks but then I went to Vegas and started smoking again.  Scheduled another appointment (free - since the center I found guaranteed you could keep going back till it worked).  I haven't smoked in over 3years after that second visit.  I recommend it to all of my friends who are trying to quite smoking!  It is soo much less painful than cold turkey, the patch etc.    "Watching my spouse die from lung cancer. "I understand the needing to smoke while at work, it was the only way I got a break too. You just have to push through, I took 2 days off when i quit so that I could get used to not smoking. Once I got back to work, I chewed gum and straws. The first couple weeks are the hardest. It helps if you have a support system to talk to and reassure you that you don't need to smoke. I had my wonderful girlfriend who put up with my more than grumpy self for a month or so until the cravings went away. I am almost at 6 months smoke free and yeah you still get the occasional craving when I drink or get really full after a meal, but they get fewer with each passing day. In the end if you want to quit then you will quit, there really isnt some secret to success here. You just have to want it. I hope you can overcome it and kick the habit, best of luck. "a pretty girl"Itaste MVP 2.0<====
I found that shitty e-cigs don't stop the need. This thing hits fat, lasts forever on a charge. I smoked a pack a day and now nothing. This was my third try after having mediocre ecigs and good ol' cold Turkey.""I never finished the book, but I'm 7+ years smoke-free at this point.  I put it by the couch on my front porch and read it while I was smoking.""My chronic smoker's cough developed into something worse. Every puff I took burned my lungs and caused me to cough so violently that I had trouble breathing. I don't know what I had exactly but it scared the shit out of me enough to make me quit. It's been around 6 months, not sure since I don't care to count the days because I know I'll never do it again. I'm 28 and I started at 18.""I knew a guy who used one match a day. Lit the next cig off the last one. Had a smoke going the minute his feet hit the floor when he got out of bed. Had one going if he went to the bathroom. Had one going in an ashtray when he was showering or eating. Decided after 20 years of smoking that he had enough. Smoked his last one down to the filter, threw it out the window of his truck and never had another one. Still amazed ot this day he pulled that off."Rehab. Not for cigarettes. But they didnt allow smoking. 60 days later no smoking. "My Dad died of lung cancer.  After a couple months, the shock wore off and I started to remember hearing his rasping voice, telling me it was OK, he was going to be with my mom soon.  Sadness outweighed stress, made it easy.""for me, being strict on the electronic cigarette seems to be working. As long as you have a decent one!

this time round, i'm coming up to four months without smoking which is a new PB! (smoker for 14 years, tried to quit 4 times in last 2)""I quit 54 days ago, according to the QuitNow Android app. As much as I enjoyed smoking, I enjoy money and life a lot more. Just realized it was time to quit. Had my doctor give me a script for Chantix and finally did it. 

Good luck and stay strong! ""I had it easy.  I have asthma, so when I couldn't breathe anymore, I stopped smoking.""My wife was really upset at the idea of me smoking; her mother died of lung cancer because she couldn't stop, herself.

Once I started having high blood pressure and the doctors told her and me that it was because I was a smoker she became really upset.  She actually didn't ask me to quit, I just saw how upset she was by it and I couldn't bring myself to continue doing something that was hurting her so much.

Sometimes I still want to smoke. But it's alright."I quit a few times but would start back up. Honestly for me it was Vaping on my E Cig. I still use it sometimes but with no nicotine in it. Its been over a year now with NO real cigs. Not even cheating."Every time I picked up a smoke I reminded myself how gross it smelt, how bad it tasted, how much I wish I never started smoking in the first place. Smoked my last cigarette in the pack then told myself every hour I go without a cigarette is an hour nicotine free, that was over two years ago."A good reason + Cold turkey"My dad stop smoking or 10 years before getting back into it due to a stress-filled divorce. He said to quit you have to be ""in the right frame of mind"" and have ""very good motivation"". He kept his last packet with his last cigarette in it on the mantle piece over the fireplace, and whenever he wanted one he'd remind himself that he'd feel worse (through being annoyed at himself) if he had it and bought more than he would feel if he left it. ""I weaned myself using cigars.  Cold turkey can work, but there's nothing wrong with using something to mitigate the nicotine withdrawal IMO.  With that said, I had one rule: don't ever smoke another cigarette.  Seems obvious, but one cigarette is how it starts.  People convince themselves they can smoke just this one .. or whatever."Cold turkey works. But what I did was set a date about 4 or 5 months in the future and then I continued to smoke like nothing was different. But I gradually worked the idea into my subconscious and before going to bed the day before my set date I smoked my last cigarette and threw the rest in the thrash. I never smoked again and its been over 6 years already. I was up to 2 packs a day when I quit. Oh yeah! also pretzel sticks whenever i got anxious."The cause of the urge to smoke is the craving of your body for CO - carbon monoxide. Hemoglobin has an affinity for CO that is 20 times greater than for oxygen. The sooner you understand that the better off you will be. You are taking in much more oxygen once you have quit. The oxygen start the internal healing process. Your body wants to get back to normal - full of deadly CO but it is healing with the new oxygen in your system and you feel funny and think that nicotine will make you feel normal again. 
I quit 31 years ago. I was a heavy smoker. In those days you could smoke in the office - anywhere. I reduced the amount I smoked daily until I was down to none with snuff as a nicotine substitute. Believe me; the nicotine was nothing. It's all Carbon Monoxide. Quitting the nicotine was the simplest thing I have ever done. Felt like I had the flu for a couple hours. Then done. Good Luck. ""I wanted to quit smoking the moment I realized I was addicted to it. I kept stopping for a couple of months then starting back again by thinking that I can be an occasional smoker (which never worked). One day with a cigarette in my mouth I was bitching to a friend how I wanted to quit. She looked at me and with frustration and tells me:"" You know all you have to do is just stop smoking"". It annoyed me how right she was. It is really just about not doing it no matter what. So I stopped cold turkey the next day. However, throughout me quitting another thing really helped me not smoke again... it was the fact that I will always love smoking I just can't smoke anymore. So now 5 years later, I haven't had a single cigarette. I still crave it from time to time, but that's ok. I go outside with my workers who smoke but I just don't smoke. So I enjoy the breaks without the lung problems. 
Good luck!""Disgust in myself, shame, and lack of health. I had to hit bottom, so to speak. I just woke up one day and said to myself, this is gross. It was really really hard to stop, but I did it cold turkey. Even now, 7 years later, I still crave a cigarette."Peeing on a stick and seeing a plus sign.  "I wanted to quit many times and failed especially when drinking or was stressed. One night I was extremely stoned and lit up a cigarette as I would normally do. Then after taking a few drags I visualized the smoke entering my body and causing harm. Not only that, I convinced myself that it was literally disguising. I became repulsed and put it out. 

The next morning I was walking to class and lit one up for the walk. I instantly was reminded to how repulsive I found smoking to be the night before. I flicked it away and never looked back since. It's been 7 years since my last cigarette. I can stand outside a bar or club and people would smoke all around me and I wouldn't be bothered one bit. 

No traumatizing experience, no one extremely close to me died from smoking. I just simply put my mind to it. "My boyfriend has smoked about a pack a day for 14 years and tried and failed to quite a couple times. Two months ago he quit cold turkey after realizing he could make his student loan payment every month with the money saved from quitting. I know that wouldn't work for everyone but I'm just super proud of him :)"Honestly it really helped that I was hospitalized and they wouldn't let me out of the grounds to smoke. I used the patch and tried not to go too crazy lol. 

Then I had to move in with  my parents for a while, and they said no smoking. Fine, their house, their rules. 

Cinnamon gum and the patch helped A LOT. 

When I started living on  my own I found myself with a pack from the corner store sometimes. I would just throw away the pack. Waste of money, but it's a waste if you smoke it too. ""I just did it one day.  Just stopped.  I had tried to quit 10x before with 1 week to 6 months smoke free.  This time I went cold turkey, and had a good fucking attitude.  I was so full of energy that it was great.

Yeah, I got cravings.  Yeah, I smoked a couple cigs on the Superbowl, and a couple more when I went bowling in March.  Then I smoked a pack when my wife went out of town in June.  I slipped up three times.  So what? I haven't smoke since June.  Between last October and June, I smoked three times.  

I just decided that I didn't want to smoke anymore, and that I needed to be 'free' from nicotine.  As soon as I felt free, I'm good.

As for the workplace, that's a tough one.  I've worked in telemarketing and restaurants, so 2/3 people smoke there.  Go for a walk outside for ten minutes.  It sounds stupid, but make it routine.  Stop your smoking routine, and start a walking routine.  Use that walk to calm down and NOT want to smoke.  You know your going to, so just plan ahead for how it makes you feel.  When you get that craving, tell yourself, It's just a craving, I don't really want it.  

Try it again!  DO IT SOON!  The faster you quit, the faster you won't be a smoker.  Sure, when you fail you feel guilt and shame.  So what.  Get over it, and try again.  It's just one little chemical that's doing this to you.

"For my mom is was 9/11. She realized how crazy the world is and thought that the end was near for all. Quit that day and hasn't had one since. "Hang in there!  I've heard it takes 11 attempts on average to quit. 

I quit alcohol and used an anticraving med. I'm not sure if there are for smoking or not (someone mentioned Zyban). Or maybe you could pair the patch or gum with e-cigs -- the patch or gum would give you a baseline nicotine level that might reduce craving and that might help you reach for the e-cigs instead of the real cigs when you want to smoke. (I'm not a doctor so this is just my theory).

Allen Carr has a book about quitting -- I haven't used it but some say it works. I used SMART recovery for alcohol (you can find the program online), but it might work for smoking too.  

If stress/anxiety is your trigger you might want to consider getting an anti-anxiety med for the short term (like a benzo). Be careful becuase they can be addictive in some people but they aren't nearly as bad for your body as cigs. 

The first days of giving up my addiction were the hardest. If you can hole yourself up and avoid all stress maybe you can make it. Hell, to quit drinking I took benzos (to prevent withdrawal) and a lunesta and slept for most of the first two days. Being unconscious for the hardest part of the withdrawal always helps! 

Exercise -- it helped my grandpa quit his chain smoking habit. It helped that he had a great daily walking partner. 

Employ every tool you can (not just one at a time). The more firing power on your side of this battle, the better. 

Good luck! 
""Stop smoking.  Literally, stop buying cigarettes and putting them in your mouth and lighting them.  That was step one.

Step two was take up running.  Once you're in the fourth mile of a six mile run, you'll regret every cigarette you've ever had.

I don't smoke now, and don't even miss them.  Best advice I can give is change your life-style through bloody-mindedness - stop smoking, and do something that is the total opposite of smoking instead (exercise).""Restraint and 4mg Nicotine gum, then i tapered down to 2mg after 6 weeks, then i would bite them in half making them 1mg. Id eventually get nauseaous chewing them, sometimes the would hit me hard since my tolerance has slowly decreased and i would get super nauseous. So i eventually got off the gum and it was bad for the first few days. I`ve been smoke free 1 yr. Its great to know that i don`t have that feeling of wanting a cigarette."I was sick and then got better but my cough persisted to the point where I couldn't sleep.  I also hated how much of a time waster they were (I rolled cigs - hate that shitty dry pre-rolled stuff).  So I just gave it up.  Cold Turkey.  Been off of them for 6 months.Being broke really helped me quit. "I joined reddit just to answer you on what worked for me.

I just hit 6 months cig free, no Ecigs at all.

Now I am going to share what worked for me, but you need to understand that you cannot quit smoking until you truly, deep down, do NOT want to be a smoker anymore. You have to not want the lifestyle, you have to WANT to say goodbye to them. Otherwise nothing will work. The mind is 90% of it, the rest comes from tactics, and here is what worked for me after many failed attempts:
What I did was go to my doctor, they had many options, I chose wellbutrin along with nicotine gum. I was supposed to take wellbutrin for 3 months and use the gum as much as needed. They had me take the pills starting a week before my quit date. NO GRADUAL STOP, you need to set a date, and quit. I averaged about 3 pieces of gum a day (morning, after work, and later at night) and sometimes more or less. After 1 month on gum and 1.5 months on wellbutrin, I dropped both of them because I felt like my hardcore cravings and daily habits were overall gone.

There are some days that are tougher than others but I have failed quitting many times and I feel truly successful this time. I go every day seeing smokers and hanging out with them without uncontrollable cravings. I also smoke Marijuana daily so that may help too since I get a ""smoke fix"" so that might be something to take into account.

Regretfully, my father never gave up his beloved cigarettes or whiskey until it all ended his life when I was just a child. If I ever have a son, or any children for that matter I know that I'll do right by them. No child deserves to grow up without their father.""find a real reason to quit.

"A girl friend. "I got really sick a year ago, had to go cold turkey on alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine on the same day. I ended up sleeping for three days, not eating for a week, and then once I came out of that haze I had gotten through the worst of the withdrawals. My triggers were being at work and driving- on my ""smoke breaks"" or in the car I would make sure that I had a cup of tea (coffee once I could have caffeine again) and sunflower seeds to get me through.

I've tried various things and know that I will always be addicted to nicotine. I accept that. I will never truly quit. 

I chewed the gum to make it through the first six months. I then moved on to regular gum and lasted a full year with no nicotine whatsoever. I experienced the death of a loved one and fell of the wagon completely for about a month but stopped again. I have to really watch myself when I drink. Now, if I drink, I just limit myself to one.""You have to want to, otherwise you are wasting your time.  A support system also helps, but it comes down to wanting it.  If you are quitting for someone else, it wont stick."Just lurk /r/stopsmoking.  Eventually it all set in for me and I just really wanted to quit."Smoked a whole pack of stale cigarettes during a concert about 6 years ago because I didn't have money for a new pack, got me sick and grossed me out so much I have not went back since. I used to be smoking about a pack a day and had been smoking since freshman year of high-school. Best decision was quitting""Group meet ups and patches. At the meets a guy would test our breath for Carbon Monoxide (I think, it was 6 years ago). The fear of being found out as a failure in front of everyone was a huge incentive. ""I decided that on a certain date that I would no longer be a smoker. There was no 'try'. All ashtrays, lighters and cigs went in the bin and that was it. From 40 a day to zero.

There was no temptation, because I was no longer a smoker. I became someone with an illness called withdrawal, that goes away quicker than you think.

If you approach it with the right mind set its really not difficult. Don't tell people you're 'trying to quit' tell them you have."Just stop buying.Cold turkey worked for me. Champix. Followed the directions and that was it!I stopped buying cigarettes."I smoked for twenty years. I smoked a pack a day easily.  One day I decided I would not have a cigarette until the third time I thought about having one. So when I thought i needed a cigarette, that was one, the next time was two, and then I would have one the third time I craved it. 

At first the three cravings happened pretty quickly, then after awhile the time between cravings increased. A year later I was smoking a pack every three days. A year after that I was smoking one or two cigarettes a day. Then one day I decided I was done. 

I have not even thought about having a cigarette in five years. 

This worked for me, it may work for you. ""A guy I work with (but see seldom) quit cold turkey.  I thought ""Man, I know I've got more willpower than that guy - if he can, I sure as hell can""

So I did.  

I'm really, really, really glad I rarely see the guy, as apparently he started up again a week or two later.  I found this out... eight, nine months later.  Had I known, I likely would have totally justified to myself having a single celebratory one (and then I'd be smoking again).

So.. yeah.  Find someone who smokes who you think has less willpower than you, convince them to quit, then quit yourself and don't talk to or see them for eight months, just keep telling yourself that they aren't smoking so goddamn it, you aren't either.""I tapered off for about 6 months, then stopped unless I was drinking at the pub and switched to a tobacco pipe as it took more work to use.

Then I would not bring the pipe to the pub every other time, then every third time, etc. After another year or so I just stopped without thinking about it. 

I have not smoked in ~3 years and have no desire to do so.""I got an electronic cigarette that had some nicotine in it. I didn't like smoking it as much as real cigarettes but it would take the edge off whenever I was craving one now I'm good! Even if you smoke an ecig strictly it's way less harmful and you can even smoke it indoors in most places. 

" I was the first grandchild on my mom's side of the family and after my grandpa held me for the first time my mom told him that if he was going to live to see me grow up he had to quit.  Cold Turkey that day"I actually started to use chewing tobacco instead. A little while after starting, like 2 months, I decided to stop dipping as well. How I quit dipping? Took a nice gulp of my spitter. Nicotine free since. ""My girlfriend's mother died of brain cancer, which is exacerbated by cigarette smoking and drinking. I quit for 1 year and 3 months, because we really dove into research, and my quitting helped her grieving process a lot. 2 months ago she broke up with me and I started again, though, so i feel pretty foolish about it. When I did quit, it was cold turkey, and i had to continuously remind myself of the damage it was doing to my body. After 2 months it became very easy not to smoke, with the exception of a handful of particularly stressful days where i wanted to smoke a pack to the head (but didn't). Otherwise, i avoided drinking with smokers and hanging out in bars and smoking areas for pretty much the whole year, did a lot more exercise and smoked other substances.... Starting to drink again really messed up my progress though. In two weeks I was smoking again.

edit:
I was a smoker for 10 years before I quit...the first time.""I took chantix in the amount it was prescribed to me.  This, unfortunately, was a dose incredibly too high for me.  After a few days of insomnia and feeling terrible, I sought advice online.  I ended up reducing my dose to a quarter of what I was given.  Eventually, the cigarettes I smoked tasted terrible and did not give me any satisfaction.  After that, it was all behavioral adjustments.  I slowly reintroduced myself to environments that would trigger a craving.  It took eight weeks to trust myself that I would never smoke again.  The main motivation for this was the fact that I NEVER wanted to go through the quitting process again.  It's been three years and I still get cravings, but I am stronger than them!""You have to want to quit. I smoked for 15+ years. Tried to quit a bunch of times. Woke up one day, reached for a pack and said nope. Not today. I walked down to walgreens and bought some patches. The patches didn't do shit. It is 90% mental. Your body will be over the actual physical need to smoke in a few days. The rest is all a head game. I had to look at it as me vs them. I put half of a carton in the freezer with a lighter to prove to myself that I was stronger than they were. It worked. 12 years later, I'm still smoke free.  I still crave it from time to time, probably always will. The urges don't last long and are not strong. 

After the first few weeks it is ALL in your head. Avoid your habitual smoking spots that can trigger the urges. If you smoked in your car, go get it detailed. If you smoke in the house, get it cleaned and wash the walls. Wash all of your clothes, towels, sheets, furniture and curtains.  Tell your buddies that you are quitting and ask them not to light up around you. Try and avoid stress if possible. The smell will almost make you nautious after a while. This is a good thing. Most of all,  remember that you are stronger than they are. 

Tl;dr A majority of it is in your head. First month sucked bad. Sucks less and less as time rolls on. "whooping cough...made me never want to do anything bad to my lungs ever again"Nothing wrong with taking several attempts. Keep trying! Took me five. 

The successful quit, I went cold turkey. And it sucked! I was on my way to the store for cigarettes, and realized that I felt awful, but would feel just as bad if I smoked. I had to sit on the curb for a minute and even cry with frustration, but I didn't get to the store. 

What helped was to build myself back up after every time I had to exercise my willpower. I would survive without a smoke, but I was left broken and beaten. The next urge would get me for sure. So, every time I made it, once the immediate danger had passed, I celebrated and dwelled on how much I wanted to quit and all the good things I was going to have. I psyched myself up until I was once again happy to not be smoking.

"I went to Reddit as i always  do when we want to know how to do something the fastest and easiest way!"I realized it was controlling me, that I was essentially no different than a crackhead.

I had compulsions to smoke, in the morning, in the car, after meals, etc.  I thought I was doing it because I enjoyed it. Then I tried not smoking after a trigger, and I couldn't think about anything else.

I'm not willing to let a compulsion like that control my behaviour, no matter how much I suffer while quitting. So once I realized what was happening, it was fairly easy to quit.

It took about two weeks cold turkey until the cravings completely stopped. The habit itself was more difficult to forgo than the nicotine.  I ate hard candy (gobstoppers), which helped a bit. I sometimes drank a beer (just one) and found that actually dulled the urge, sometimes significantly. But YMMV on that.

Best advice: avoid your triggers as much as possible. If you can take an vacation (not with extended family or other sources of stress), that might work better for you.  

Also, try to add a new healthy habit to replace smoking. When you get a craving, turn to your new healthy habit - the object being to force thoughts of smoking to compete with new, healthy thoughts for expression. You may also be able to get a small buzz from deep breathing.""20 years quit, I had to REALLY.WANT.TO, quit cold turkey, but I know, 1 cigarette and I will be hooked. even 20 years later."Poverty"Skipping more and more until I was done.

Had a craving - would let myself have one, then next craving - wouldn't..  Then would start skipping two cravings. Eventually it came to a point where I was just done.

Importantly, I didn't stress myself out about it. If I felt like having one, I did - but then went right back to long periods of abstaining. Then eventually I was down to like 1 or 2 while camping in the summer. And now as of last year, I don't even feel the need to bother with those.

Fucking freedom. :)""my mother quitted smoking when she got pregnant but start to smoke again, started to smoke young  because of friends, she says it takes stress away but i had some breathing problems so she never smoked near me again""Will power. As hard as it is, I knew that continuing was just hurting me more than helping. It took a good 3 attempts but it's been about a month now. I still have cravings ones in a while, especially when I get stressed out at work, but I started finding other ways to help out with that. Fap, video games, working out, walking/hiking with my dog. These things sounded horrible (excluding fapping and video games) while I was smoking, but now it just makes me feel good overall. I get up earlier, make myself a nice breakfast, get home after work and take my dog walking. Idk, it was hard, not sayin it's not, but you won't regret it. Idk if it's permanent for me, since I love smoking socially, so maybe one day I'll be back, but it's always nice to take those breaks.""I quit on new year's day exactly last year. I quit once before, for a bout 6 months but then started again. I quit again because during those 6 months, I could breathe better, tasted things better, could smell better, didn't stink, and most of all, I didn't get one cold. As soon as I started up again, I got sick, could breathe well, couldn't smell and started to get a cough. On new year's I was sick, and I knew it was because of smoking, so on new year's day I had my last cigarette. The key is to want to quit. Sure you know you should, but you have to want it, want it like you've never wanted anything else. You know how you saved up for that new TV and you put a lot of restraint on spending frivolously, and saving every penny you could? Remember how you cleaned your house top to bottom and scrubbed and vacuumed and dusted every inch so it would be immaculate? You have to put that much dedication into NOT doing something (smoking) Coffee, breakfast, supper, snacks, driving, boredom, beers, all were triggers for smoking for me. The thing was I knew what was on the other side of not smoking, having quit for 6 months before, and it was way more beneficial to just not go for one, than actually have one. No you wont save any more money like people say, but you'll just have a feeling of overall goodness. Godspeed my friend. It's a tricky battle, but in the end, you'll know finally have that will power to just say no. "For me it was nicotine gum.Having the flu for two weeks 3 years ago.  I vomited every time I tried to smoke.  After the 2nd day I didn't like cigarettes any more.  I still occasionally smoke a cigar or puff on e-cig at work but no more cigs. I suppose you could Pavlov yourself to the same effect without actually being sick."I only smoked for a couple years but ya, cold turkey is the only way.""I bet a friend $1000 dollars on who would smoke first. Everyone was like ""what if you cheat?"" well then I would feel bad about screwing my friend over. 

$1000 is a strong motivation to avoid that next smoke.""Taking up pipe smoking did it for me. I no longer have cravings. I might smoke a few bowls of tobacco each week but the need for a nic fix is so insignificant that I often forget to smoke at all. Part of it is that pipe smoking has a learning curve. It's more of a ritual. It isn't something you could practically do when you are pressed for time. This limits the number of opportunities to smoke throughout the day, if you are a working man. Secondly, A greater majority of pipe tobaccos are not loaded down with additives which contribute to strong cravings. It really is the best of both worlds. It's a very cheap luxury compared to cigarettes and the aromatic blends can be pleasing to the sensibilities of non-smokers. When you are fatigued, a good bowl in the evening can restore some mental acuity. It may seem counter-intuitive but pipe smoking is a good way to ween yourself off cigarettes in my experience.  ""OP, there are already a lot of comments here, but I'll post anyway in case it helps. What I did was purchase the 4mg nicotine lozenges. The lozenges are, IMO, superior to patches and gum because like a cigarette, when the lozenge is dissolved, or in the case of the cigarette burnt up, the drug is gone. So psychologically when you feel like you need a hit you will know when you are getting it. 

Anyway, the use of these lozenges worked like this for me... Cigarette craving kicks in and I would pop two 4mg lozenges. This was strong and was more than enough to kill the cigarette craving. You just pop them whenever you get a craving and it will kill it. Keep this up for a few months and eventually you will lose the smoking habit, but still be addicted to the lozenges. The nice thing is that the lozenges are expensive and not all that pleasurable, so at some point you just get sick of buying them. Worked for me. Good luck, smokers.""Stratera for add, idk what it is about tobacco smoke, but just the thought of it makes me want to vomit. Chantex also works really well."I got 2 ounces of weed and rolled perfect cigarette looking joints. I just smoked them like cigarettes. "What type of E-Cigarette do you have barbie? Chances are you're using a small 'cigarette sized' e-cigarette which many find to be unreliable, or rather unsatisfying.

""Bought a big ass pouch of Levi Garrett. I told myself that if I needed a nicotine fix, that was it. Holy shitski, that stuff is gross. Had to force myself to use it to get the edge off.

""The cost of cigarettes in NY is unfathomable. $10 a pack on Long Island, about $14 in New York City. Both my husband and I were smokers and the habit was costing us about $7000 a year.

""I treated my addiction the same way Russell Brand treated his herion addiction. I still do. One day at a time. I had just come off a terrible chest cold. The kind where you can't inhale even after coughing up so much phlegm that you gag a little. I kept thinking, ""'I don't want to live my last few years breathing like this with an oxygen tank."" Then the coughing slowly subsided, and I stepped outside for a cigarette break because that's what you do when you have smoked for 17 years off and on. I hated it, but I tried my hardest to finish that cigarette even thought it felt like fiberglass in my lungs. That same day I read this. Now I say, ""If I still need it in 30 minutes or 2 hours or tomorrow, then I will have it."" I take a few long deep breaths to increase my oxygen level, and, in a few minutes, I don't need it any more. I haven't smoked in almost a full year. I almost don't miss it.

I think it was just the thing to do for a while when I was young and it felt cool to do it with other kids my age.  Then I realized I didn't have to do what the lot was doing and started weaning off.

My motivation for quitting was ""not doing so would expose me to cancer and whatnot."" That seldom works, as our present selves are so disconnected from our future selves.

What ultimately worked for me was changing the frame. I said: ""Look mate, your birthday present this year is to quit smoking. You will also find in the package: better breath, better stamina, more money, and so on."" You will hold on to the present every single day by choosing not to light that cigarette.

Master Yoda""What worked for myself was switching back to smoking marijuana instead of cigarettes. I never noticed the nicotine cravings and after several weeks I was able to quite smoking weed (a **much** easier endeavor). Haven't had a cigarette in over six months and off of pot for over four. I **AM NOT** saying that this method would work for everyone. I am saying it worked for me.

Also let me add that quitting would have been futile had I not chosen to quit and had the honest desire to be clean. The marijuana was just the method I used.""It took me seven tries, over several years, but each time I failed I followed a set of guidelines to make it more likely I'd succeed the next time:

1) Forgive yourself. This is extremely important. You don't want to associate bad feelings with quitting. Nicotine is an extremely addictive drug, and you're more likely to fail than succeed at least the first time, so roll with it, and then:

2) What did you learn? You failed for a variety of reasons. What were they? How can you address those the next time?

Over several tries, I gradually dealt with the failure points, addressing them specifically. There are only so many of them, so dealing with them in that way means that you're eventually bound to succeed, and I did. More, even though I did fail several more times, it got easier each time; and the last time felt almost effortless.

What I learned:

0) **Wait till you're ready.** It's fine to pick an arbitrary date, but don't invest any special meaning in it. Statistically, you're likely to fail, and it's important to avoid associations between failure and anything neutral or positive, such as calendar dates. If you fail after New Year's, you may form an association between failure and New Year's, for example. But if you pick an arbitrary date with no other meaning, then that's less likely to happen, and will make it easier to try again. Likewise, don't link quitting to other things such as relationships, jobs, and such. Quitting is *hard,* and you don't need that extra baggage. Let it be it's own thing. Also, don't plan to quit if you're already under acute stress, for the same reason; it just makes it harder.

1) **Nicotine is a 'resident' addictive agent.** This means that the addictive responce exists for as long as the chemical is in your system, and is proportional to how much of it there is inside you. It takes about 30 days to completely purge from your body, but it does so by geometric rather than linear curve. After just a few days, nearly half of it is gone from your system. After a week or so, about two thirds to three quarters. So if you can make it even one week, you're more than halfway to being free of the *chemical* addiction. So:

2) **Cold turkey is best, if you can do it.** Not everyone can, and I respect that. I've been there, and I know how hard it is. But you should know that things like patches and gum only extend the chemical addiction. They *do* help wean you off the smoky part, though, so that's good; but you've been conditioned to get the drug from smoking, not from chewing gum, and unless you can afford to chew that gum for a long time, it can only do so much to help you stop *smoking*. So I'm not knocking these tools, but they are costly and have their own issues, and if you're able to avoid them, I recommend that. Cold turkey is hard and unpleasant, but it's the much faster route to getting clean, and getting clean is half the battle.

3) **The real addiction is not chemical.** Nicotine is incredibly addictive, make no mistake about it. If smokers seem to behave irrationally, it's because they're hardcore addicts. Scorn them if you must, but also pity them. They're dealing with a very real chemical addiction, with everything that implies. Yet those who've quit will tell you that the chemistry is less than half of it. The real addiction is the complex system of social and physical habits and behaviours built up through years of conditioning. Smoking is very literally a *habit,* and overcoming it means overcoming the habit, not just the addiction. And the habit, it turns out, is the harder thing to overcome. The reason is that unlike the addiction, the habit is not resident. If you quit the drug, the chemical addiction leaches out at the same rate the drug does. But you can't leach out the habit as quickly or easily. Because:

4) **Habits are *literally* hardwired into your brain.** And I do mean that literally. Well-practiced habits are reflected in *physical* modifications to your brain. Musicians, martial artists, and others in fields that demand accurate but nearly instantaneous physical responce call this 'muscle memory'. It's why a guitarist must practice scales over and over, until they no longer have to think about it. It's also why you space out on your drive to work and don't remember making the trip: With repetition, your brain hardwires the necessary pathways, and you no longer have to think about it consciously, freeing your higher mind for other things. The reason a good martial artist can react so fast is that they've retrained their body to react in particular ways, nearly as quickly as that random jerk you make when someone startles you. They don't have to think about it; the body just reacts. Smoking becomes like that, and that's what makes it so bloody hard to quit.

5) **You cannot 'break' a habit.** As described above, a 'habit' is a literal physical construct within your brain. Unless you undergo brain surgery (of a kind not yet available to us) or sustain a brain *injury,* you can't 'break' a habit. And you wouldn't want to, either: Your brain is like a big box of Legos, and can be rearranged in many ways. If you actually 'broke' one of those hardwired habits, you'd *damage* your brain. What you really want is to change the arrangement, and that just takes time. As the habit was originally formed, so it must be undone.

6) **When you 'break' the habit of smoking, what you're really doing is displacing it with the *new* habit of *not* smoking.** For this reason, the psychological approach must be direct, targeted, and above all *sustained*. Your brain cannot and *will* not maintain two *contradictory* habits. If you stop reinforcing one, and start to practice a *contradictory* one, which you then *reinforce,* the new habit *will* in time displace the old one -- again, literally rewiring your brain to accommodate the new habit, and breaking down the old one in the process. This may seem to contradict the old saw about riding a bike, but not reinforcing a habit over time is not the same thing as directly challenging it. Few people actively develop the contradictory habit of *falling* off a bike. And *that's* the reason that just ceasing smoking is so often not enough by itself.

7) **Directly contradict the key elements of your habit.** What I did over time was identify the most pronounced aspects of my habit, and then challenge them directly, one at a time. For example, I noticed that I most enjoyed a cigarette right after a meal. So I made a point to *deny* myself that. Over time, that deprivation eroded my association of eating with smoking. I noticed that I also greatly enjoyed it with a drink, so I then denied it there, and that eroded my association between those two things. I was never one of them, but many people like to light up first thing in the morning; if I had been one of them, I would have made a point to deny it to myself then. In the larger view, this also erodes the more general association of smoking with being happy or being content. I also realised that there were times when I *didn't* like to smoke, and I made a point to make myself light up at those times. Though these points are much fewer, they are particularly good points to go after, because they start to build an association between smoking and *not* being happy or content. Smoking starts to seem like a vexation, something to avoid.

8) **Baby steps.** The habit is complex and has many external links, most of which you're probably not consciously aware of. But there are only so many of them, and if you train yourself to pay attention, you'll identify at least the bigger ones. Take those on *one at a time*. Each one will have its own stress, so deal with them one by one. As you overcome each one, start looking for the next one. That is, don't start looking for the next one while you're still dealing with the current one. It will take longer this way, but you're more likely to succeed this way, and success is the goal, more than speed. It does no good to quit sooner, if you just end up smoking again later on. You want to quit *for good*. So take your time, and do it right. You want your healthy new habit to stick, and gradually disassembling the old one is the surest way to do that; then you can build your healthy new habit on level ground, without the boulders of old habits making it harder.

9) **Avoid triggers.** Many things are triggers. Identify them and learn to avoid them. During the quitting process, triggers are weak points that can penetrate your resolve. Common triggers are certain places and social situations, such as meals out with friends, bars, and such. You shouldn't be a recluse (after the first week, heh), but keep low for at least the first month or so. Especially while the chemical is still in your system (30 days or so), triggers are a real risk you want to avoid.

10) **Accentuate the positive.** Do fun things, things that make you laugh and smile. Funny movies, stand-up comedy specials, whatever gets you to smile. Not because you're going through a rough time, but because you want to form an association between not smoking and being happy. It sounds stupid, but studies prove that *making yourself smile,* even when you don't feel like it, actually improves your mood. Watching or doing things that would normally encourage that physiological behaviour will make it easier for you to do that.
""11) **There will be blood.** One of smoking's effects is suppressing the action of tiny cilia in your lungs whose job is to lift foreign matter out so you can expel it. This is one of the exacerbating factors of emphysema: Your lungs reach a point where they *can't* clean themselves anymore, and never will, and then it's just waiting through your slow, agonising spiral into death, gasping all the way. Anyway, if you haven't reached that point of no return yet, your cilia will slowly start to recover starting a few weeks after you quit, and go back to work. Slowly at first, but more aggressively as they go. By a couple months in, you'll be coughing *a lot,* nearly constantly. This is the effect of your lungs cleaning themselves, and it's nasty and unpleasant, and sometimes gross. Expect off-colour sputum that may smell or taste bad or have unusual consistency. Sometimes there may be small traces of blood, too; *small* traces are fine. If you see anything truly alarming, though, get it checked out. Pulmonary haemorrhage is no joke, and can be very serious -- and can result from some kinds of strenuous coughing. It gets worst around three to four months, when the cilia start to really get in gear, and that stuff is getting moved through the open channels of your lungs. Then it starts to slowly subside, and after about six months will taper off rapidly. You'll still probably cough now and then for up to a couple years, but you're pretty much clean at six months.

12) **Refriending your triggers.** This is a critical detail that I got wrong the first few times until I realised the problem, and one that many people also overlook. Even after you've quit, those old triggers remain for a long time, because they are also part of your hardwired process. It would accelerate the process of quitting to disassemble them at the same time, but that increases the chances of recidivism and relapse -- both of which can make future attempts to quit harder -- so I don't encourage that. But if you think you're strong enough, go for it. What I recommend instead is to wait a few months before gradually reintroducing yourself to those triggers. You must learn to face them and *not* smoke, in order to erode the association. What you'll do at this point is do those old things that you formerly associated with smoking, and make a point to *enjoy* them *without* smoking. This is necessary to break down the old associations and build healthier new ones. This is a difficult thing for many people, so be sure to build in escapes in case you start to feel overwhelmed. There may be times you have to just walk away; if you reach that point, then *walk away* and try again later. Don't try to fight it head-on if it starts to get difficult. It's a gradual process, and risking failure is a poor strategy.

13) **Patience, Grasshopper.** It takes around SIX MONTHS to fully purge the habit of smoking. Coincidentally, that's about when your lungs finally finish most of the work of cleaning themselves, too. So it's at this point that you should be 'done with it' and can finally declare yourself free.

14) **Get back on the bike.** A real bike, I mean. Or an exercise bike. Or whatever gets your heart and lungs moving. Go easy at first. Start by walking, perhaps, then walking more briskly. You're still recovering from a major assault on your body's health that will take a few years to fully recover from. (And I must be honest here: Some people will never recover fully, but you should make your best effort.) It won't help to push your body beyond its limits, especially early on. You can still tear your lung tissues if you work them too hard for too long. You can still push your heart too far, too. You need to refurbish these systems *gradually*. Plan on two to three years to regain peak performance, and shoot for no more than 50% improvement in the first year after the end of the six months of quitting. This is the safest and surest way of making a full recovery.

15) **Don't forget Wheaton's Law.** One thing that happens once you're fully clean is that you finally *really see* how nasty smoking is. And there will of course be many people around who still smoke. You'll find it impossible to ignore. It will look like someone shooting up right in front of you. You'll pity them, but also feel disgust, and maybe even bewilderment that obviously intelligent people can do that. If you smoke right now, that may sound crazy and unlikely, but I assure you it's very common. If you've been clean a couple years or more, you've likely had that experience, and may find it perplexing, since you, too, used to smoke. But the reason is not hard to understand: The greater part of the habit is autonomic, like an itch you have to scratch. When you're inside that bubble, whatever you have to do to scratch the itch seems much more reasonable. It's only from completely outside it that you see how absurd and counterintuitive it really is. But the reasons are not as important as how you respond to your sense of disgust. *Don't be a dick.* Your brain has by now purged the better part of your *visceral* memories of smoking, so *even though you've been there yourself,* it's now much harder for you to understand it. You've likely also built up some degree of pathological avoidance of revisiting those old memories. If you've *recently* quit, that's *good,* because they can weaken your resolve. But if it's been a few years, then it's time for you reach back and deal with them; this is the last stage of quitting, the one they never tell you about. Years after, you have to revisit those old demons and confront them a final time and come to peace with them. And that will allow you to be *compassionate* towards those still stuck on the other side, and be ready to help them escape like you did.
""Alan Carr's book.

Seriously, read it.""Rimonabant as part of a pharmaceutical study.  They paid me to take an experimental Cannabaniod receptor inhibitor, and I haven't had a cigarette since August 15, 2003.  The first time I quit was in Air Force 
Basic Training, as I didn't have a choice, but since I wasn't committed, I started back when I left basic. Acupuncture didn't work for me, before that as I wasn't committed.  Committing to quitting is what actually works!!!
""I had been a half a pack/day smoker for over three years, and one night I went to a dive bar down the street from where I lived. I'd been there before, but never realized how much smoke was there. The next day when I smelled my jacket, I wanted to vomit. I did not want to smell like that, and had no idea that I did! I am now almost a month smoke-free! ""I tried quitting several times before I succeeded.  The difference was that by then I hated smoking.

Learning to hate smoking was a long process.  I focused on the negatives of smoking and reminded myself of them at every opportunity.  I picked a number of things I disliked - the smell on my clothes, the bad breath, the cost, the control over my schedule, the decreased lung capacity.  I intentionally drilled in hate at each opportunity.  When I felt the need for nicotine, I cursed it's control over me.  When I bought cigarettes, I cursed the money I could spend on something better.  When I walked up the stairs or ran, I cursed the fact that smoking slowed me down.

After a few months of this, I really actually hated smoking with a passion.  I used the patch to quit, which helps because you can break the habits independently of breaking the addiction.  My intense hatred for smoking helped me to not go back.  After the bonds were broken, I wanted nothing to do with it.""I thought I could never quit, but I did for 23 years now, and here's what worked for me.

1) Pick a date way in the future, 3 - 6 months in the future. This gives you lots of time to get pumped up and make a big deal out of it.

2) Constantly read those horrific lists of all the things that are bad from smoking (they're usually 2 - 3 pages long)

3) Smoke a lot between now and the quit date. Smokers who smoke less cigs often develop more of a connection between certain activities and cigarettes compared to smokers who just hack away all day. In other words, don't try to cut back and cut back. Smoke the fuck away for the next 3 - 6 months with no reservations. One friend said to me, ""Won't that be unhealthy?"". Really? Does anyone think smoking heavy for 3 more months, then quitting the rest of your life is unhealthy? If this method works, it will be the singe most healthy thing you have ever done.

4) When the big day comes, enjoy smoking that whole day. Then at midnight, take your remaining cigarettes and rip them up in your bare hands and curse very loudly at them... ""FUCK YOU YOU MOTHER FUCKERS"" ... yell so loud and curse so hard that you start mother-fucking crying really hard. It should be one of those combined angry, yet sad all at the same time cries. 

5) Disclaimer: This next step is not for everyone but it worked for me: For the first week, every time you feel like smoking, drink alcohol. At least from the late afternoon on. Over the weekend, drink alcohol a lot, every time you feel like smoking. 

 5a) Here's why this works my dear friends: If you fail, 90% of the time it's while you're drinking alcohol. You're at a bar, or a wedding, and you weaken and have ONE SMOKE, which we all know means you are done. HOWEVER, now that you have conditioned yourself to drinking without smoking, you are immune to the affects of alcohol on smoking. 

6) Understand that you must never, ever take a single puff of smoke ever again under any circumstances. You are just like a recovering heroin addict. You cannot just have a little. In fact, you must never experience nicotine in your bloodstream ever again, even if we're talking about chewing tobacco (and Skoal/Copenhagen) or whatever. You are a recovering smoke and nicotine addict and can never have that shit again, ever. 


I failed many times before I tried this, but I did this in 1990 and haven't had one single puff of smoke since then, and I really never ever feel tempted. As an unexpected bonus, I gained a certain kind of confidence from quitting smoking that I later used when I had to lose 40 lbs. I did that. Then I started hitting the gym and I kept that habit for 10 years now, am healthier than ever, and have a reasonably ripped body. It's confidence building more confidence.

Go forth and quit my friends (but not for a few more months!)

"Racing actually.  I have to be in top shape and smoking is a good way to lose sponsorship opportunities.  Sometimes I wish I could race in the 70's era for a weekend."Electronic, it was a gradual process and i did have an analog cigg here an there but now i have almost no desire. My boss who was a 2 pack a day smoker also only smokes electronic. And he smokes a lot of the juice. Co-worker also used electronic and he also doesn't smoke at all anymore. A little weed here and there also helps."One day I smoked one and it tasted disgusting. Never smoked single cig again."I quit two years ago using the patch, some cognitive adjustments and a boatload of healthy snacks. I was 42 and had smoked since I was 14. I knew I had to quit for health and financial reasons, but it was the increasing self-loathing that galvanized it. That, and losing my mum to cancer. 

Here's what worked for me:

I set a date.
That way, I could psychologically work my way up to The Last Day. (Mine was the anniversary of my mum's death.)

I stocked up on snacks.
I went out and bought a shit-ton of sunflower seeds, peanuts, fruit, and veggies. Anything that would keep my hands and my mouth busy. All day. Every day.

I kept a record.
I had a blackboard above my desk at work and every day I would come in and write how many days I hadn't had a cigarette. It was very validating and a good deterrent against picking up a smoke. Also, I posted pics of that blackboard on Facebook and got a ton of encouragement. It helped, a lot.

I changed my thinking.
I told myself to just make it through the minute. The next hour. The next day. That I'm always one drag away from buying a carton so I just had to make it through the next craving and I'll be fine.

I distanced myself from smokers.
Just for the first little while. I can resist anything but temptation. I'm totally okay being around smokers now.

That's just what worked for me. Ultimately, you have to be ready psychologically. Good luck to everyone out there trying to quit. It's worth all the discomfort. 

""Champix. Take it for a few months.  Carry on smoking for the first 2 weeks and you notice the cigarettes do nothing for you and taste horrible. 

Of course you need a bit of willpower but it's so insignificant compared to other methods. ""Have you tried the E-Go e cigarettes?  I tried the Blu cigarettes and then someone gave me a fancy e cig that was super complicated and I ended up smoking regular cigs because of the hassle.  I got the E-Go and I LOVE IT.  It doesn't leak, it's really easy to use and the pass thrus hold a good charge.  Good luck."Read Easyway by Allen Carr. Not smoked in 6 months. Just gave it up and I don't want to smoke anymore"Nicotine patches. Accept no imitation people, if you don't get the rash these will do the trick.""I'm surprised the top comment here isn't : kids. 

As a child of chain smoking parents u've never seen the attraction of it. So thanks to my parents I've never smoked. 

Seriously, white school shirts turning yellow, smelling, and a constant cough as a child is enough to resent you as a parent for life. At least, with me it is. ""There are a number of tactics I used to quit. The hard part of quitting is dealing with your cravings. One has to understand that the first three days are when your cravings will be the worst. Having the mind set that after getting past that hump quitting will get easier helped me.

Some tactics I use are...

1) Do some form of physical activity when your cravings happen. This can be difficult depending where you are. Even if you can do push up or squats they will help.
2) Try to control your breathing when a craving hits. I know it sounds weird but taking deep breaths help me control my craving.
3) Nicotine patches/gum used with electronic vapour cigarettes has also help me. This tactic helped me deal with my bodies physical addiction while satisfying the mental addiction of needing to smoke something.
4) If you know people who have died to cancer due to smoking think about them when a craving hits. Think about how all their loved ones felt losing them to something that is fixable.

Hope this helps! You have to understand the magnitude quitting smoking has on your life. Your honestly fighting for your life.  Good luck!""I had wanted to quit for a while but the thing was I couldn't do it for me...it wasn't until I found someone that I wanted to be with that I knew wouldn't want me to smoke that got me to quit.
It wasn't difficult or painful either, just a complete and total stop because I had something else to have my mind on.  I smoked for 7 years so it's not something that I wasn't invested in, just found something better...""I started when I was 13, quitting very briefly at 16 and then for 22 months when I was 25. 

I started dating someone who didn't smoke. I would apologize for going out to smoke or smelling like smoke, and he would tell me that he thinks people should do what they want to do. Welp, I fell in love with him. I wanted to be around him for a long time, and I didn't want him to have to breathe secondhand smoke. 

I was a pack-a-day smoker. I tapered off for a week and then just stopped. I have three poker chips that play with in my cigarette hand when I'm driving or generally fidgety. They are very smooth now.

My two-year mark was January 17th, and we'll have been dating for 3 years on May 4th.""Someone told me I couldn't do it, so I did. My trick was jolly ranchers.

My dad hasn't smoked in over 2 years since he heard the news.""Smoker for 5 years. I quit cold turkey. The way I stayed off the cigs was by avoiding situations I would be tempted to smoke. This means drinking, especially at a bar. I can drink now but occasionally get the urge when I'm hammered. Luckily I back to the cigs smell and taste gross frame of mind. 

It's all about self control, u are ultimately fighting ur scumbag brain.

Also looking at gross pictures of other types of cancers here on Reddit may have helped too."Supportive partner and weaning myself back slowly...and always admitting that I would love a cigarette but not letting that discourage me. I just used it as motivation that I could want something so bad, but am still able to resist and that's something to be proud of.  I'm almost at my 1 year mark now.""Two stories. 

My grandpa was a 2 pack a day guy. As a kid, I tried to get him to stop every way I could and finally one day he just got tired of coughing a lot and quit cold turkey. Came home, broke the cigs he had left and threw them away. Nobody could make him quit but him

Second is my best friends mom. She used to smoke a lot and one day she was driving around with her kids and me in the back, windows down a little to let the smoke out and it's raining. She finally realized what she was doing and how if effected us and quit slowly. ""I got down to 3 cigarettes a day and realized it was time.  

I had tried almost everything at the time and although I decreased smoking a bunch I couldn't quit. 

Then I did....

""My motivation was also a pregnant wife and not wanting to model bad behavior. And with so many failed attempts before, I tried the pill Zyban, which is essentially the anti-depressant wellbutrin was found in some patients to ELIMINATE THE DESIRE TO SMOKE. It totally worked for me! I lost the desire to smoke. I couldn't smoke one if I tried. But 17 days in, I had allergic reaction to it and stopped the pill. Luckily that was enough. I've never smoked or desired another cigarette since. That was 13 years ago.""I never smoked because I have severe asthma. However, all of my high school friends smoked.

Now, all of my friends no longer use tobacco and are now using electronic cigarettes. I can only recommend /r/electronic_cigarette. Stop using the ""real"" tobacco, there has to be something out there to get you to switch to vaping.""For me it was a combination of things. First I was in Atlanta for a weekend visiting some friends when I ran out of cigarettes. If you don't know they are like ten bucks a pack there and I just refused to pay that much. Second, in the middle of the next week I was going to get my wisdom teeth out and knew I wasn't going to be able to smoke for a couple of days after. So I just decided to keep on not smoking and it pretty much worked. "Smoked in my teenage years and by my early twenties I was smoking 60 a day. I would be lighting my next cigarette from the one I was finishing. I was spending more on smoking then I was on rent.

So half way there."I had a boss once who quit after it occurred to him that, ""rich tobacco company CEOs are getting richer by killing my children's father.""""I started smoking because at my job, too, only smokers got a break. You couldn't even be standing out there with them, you had to be smoking.Fifteen years later I was broke and managed to get an e-cig. It was cheaper, but eventually it was food or replacement cartridges. I basically quit cold turkey, I guess. Sometimes I miss the physical motions and oral fixation, but don't miss the taste or the smell.""I quit cold turkey after 15 years of smoking after college.  At first I started drinking 2x more, than I got into to running.  Between whiskey and drinking so much I never thought much of smoking after that."I was lucky to get an ear infection that made me feel so sick for 5 days I couldn't smoke.

The only ""trick"" is to WANT to quit.  Not 'know i should' or 'i really should...' - you have to make your mind up and follow through.

All the things that make you even come up with the idea TO quit, keep them fresh - set a daily reminder on your phone to remind yourself.  I strongly recommend QuitNow (for android, not sure ios).

Its really just a decision .... and then a test of willpower.  Are you weak? no? ..... then prove it.... youre only letting yourself down.

For me, I used to think ""wtf am I even doing this for? a headache? to stink? to waste money?"" and then id get mad at myself for being weak.  Before I knew it... 2 weeks have passed (how long it takes for your body to be off the physical addiction of nicotine) and after that its just a brain game.   

So reverting or 'failing' is just a weakness.  Make the decision.

Be Sure you tell your friends that still smoke to not offer you any and to respect the fact that you want to quit

""The electronic cigarette didn't work for me for the first couple of months. I had to make a game of it.

Go as long as you can stand using only the e-cig. When you feel like you're going to die, smoke the cigarette, then repeat the process. Eventually, the cigarettes will be too much nicotine as compared with a hit from the e-cig; you'll start to get nauseous, like you did when you first started smoking.

Then, one pack, when you're almost entirely down to vaping, make the conscious decision that *this will be your last pack*.

Save the very last cigarette for a clear, starry night. Brew yourself a cup of your favorite hot beverage (I like black coffee). Wrap yourself in a comfy fleece blanket, sit under the stars, really *savor* your last cigarette. You're saying goodbye to a close friend; this is like breaking up with a lover you really don't want to leave, but you know it's for the best. Enjoy the last of your time together.

And then upgrade your e-cig to something that'll last you a while. I like the Kanger EVOD. Find a juice you really like, not just whatever the company that made your device is putting in their cartridges. Embrace your new nicotine delivery system; this is what's enabling you to quit smoking without giving up your chemical vice, and it is your new friend.

Enjoy the freedom the e-cig provides. Don't be a dick; don't be that guy vaping in the checkout line at the grocery store. *Do* enjoy your ability to vape while browsing, vape while gaming, vape while watching television.

If you're like me, it's not the cigarettes you'll miss. It's the commercial breaks from real life. For years and years, anytime a stressful situation arises, we've been going to commercial. We indulge our chemical habit, it helps us handle the stressful situation, and then we return and deal with things. Suddenly you don't have that, so start looking for other ways to do it. If you have a smartphone, browsing a subreddit that makes you smile is a good way to go."Just keep quitting. "1. Repetition - I had to 'quit' about 9-10 times (counting each pause of at least 3 weeks or more). The first few times I quit, when I would relapse, I would go back to smoking a lot almost overnight. That was a mistake. So for 2-3 years, I kept trying to quit and failed many more times. BUT every time I started smoking again, I would make sure that it was a little less than I was smoking before. (Pack a day, quit, pack and a half a day, quit, little over a half a pack, quit, repeat, etc.). I couldn't find a good study to support this, but I do remember studying anti-smoking campaigns in graduate school. I may be pulling this number out of my ass, but I believe it takes 9-12 quit attempts for most people so you being at 5 is totally normal.

2. Support -- getting people around you who will discourage from smoking while not disparaging you for slipping-up is important. Too much can be quite irritating and (ironically) drive you to smoke. So finding someone who understands that its tough but will still lay-off if you slip is key.

3. I'm not sure about E-cigs -- I see a lot of people I know try them to quit but end-up becoming more addicted to nicotine because their intake actually increases. E-cigs are better for you but if becomes a compliment to and not a substitute for cigarettes, it may be counterproductive.

Have some other thoughts but gotta go to work."It was my diminishing health that caused me to quit after 9 years. "I wanted to stop but quitting cold turkey was just too hard. So I told myself I will only smoke on the weekend. So after a few weekends of smoking, I eventually lost interest in having it as my ""reward"". It just phased itself out of my weekends, and out of my life. 

Another bonus to not smoking anymore is that hangovers aren't nearly as bad either. ""Not sure what kind if ecig you have, but try a nice 

e-go twist with a protank 2. Go to a vape shop and get a good flavor. Wake n vape, capachino, French vanilla, ect. Do not keep cigarettes. The first few days go outside and vape like you would normally smoke. Just realize that's your new cig. That's how in 5 months without a puff. Smoked 25 years 1.5 packs a day. Don't bother with Blu and the other cheap ecigs. Go online or to a vape shop and get a real set up and at vape shops you can text different flavors."Nicotine Nasal Spray. It blew my head off."Personally I knew it was also my time. I had only been smoking for two years but I could see the toll it was taking on me. I could no longer hike as much as I had previously liked too and I just smelled shitty all the time. Eventually I got fed up with myself enough and one day while buying a pack of butts I simply refused to pay. (It's just about $10 a pack where I'm from) With a little support from my wonderful girlfriend I just gave it up.




I also smoked a ton of weed and that helped. Kinda just forgot about em after a while and I haven't smoked a cigarette in over two months!  Everyday is a little success, you just have to get through the first three and you'll be golden. NO NICOTINE AT ALL, NOT EVEN THE ELECTRIC CIGS!!!    And don't cave when you feel the urge to smoke...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE"Tobacco companies HATE him."It's a personal philosophy of mine that you can only quit when you are ready to quit. For about a week I kept talking about not being ready to give them up, but then I realized I didn't enjoy smoking them anymore and decided that when my tobacco pouch ran out that I would quit, little did I know that my filters and rizla would run out at the same time. If that isn't a sign to quit smoking, I dont know what is.""I started a new job, and no one at the new place smoked. My husband had quit completely a few years before, and I was at that point smoking no more than 2 cigarettes in any given day, often going entire days without. But it was knowing I'd be the only smoker in an office of 60 people that was the real impetus for me quitting 100%. Haven't had a single cigarette since that day. It will have been 3 years on Valentine's Day. ""I had been smoking for 4 years & about a pack a day. I had tried to quit about 4 times with no luck. At the time I was dating someone who's goal was to get me to quit, so it just turned into me not smoking around him. Eventually we went to go live in Costa Rica together & I would smoke when he wasn't around & around him when I was drunk. On my 22nd birthday we were at a strip club & I grabbed a cigarette from my friend & he completely freaked out. We got into a huge fight on my birthday. Normally I am a very down to earth, no selfish person, but when it's my mother fucking birthday, I can do whatever the hell I want. So, anyway, the next day I went to Nicaragua with some friends & left him behind. While I was there, I smoked my ass off. When I got back a couple days later, I decided I was done smoking. So far it's been 2 & a half years and I haven't smoke at all. I think it just got to the point where I was ready to quit & stay committed. ""I started using vapor taste better no smell and still look cool ;)
""My dad ate those cinnamon fireball candies every time he wanted a cigarette, apparently that worked pretty well for him."Well if you drink you definitely have to stop drinking for a while because every time you have a drink you will want a cig ten times as much. Quitting with other people also really helps. Lots of chewing gum too. Got pregnant.. "The first time I was actually able to smell how terrible smoking makes you smell, I was done smoking for good.  I quit because I got sick and had a sore throat, well a couple of weeks went by and I started to be able to smell things better and the first time I realized, ""Wow, that's how I used to smell after taking a smoke break"". I was done.""1.4 pack a day smoker, electonic cigarettes have had me clean for quite some time now. 

/r/elecontic_cigarette ""I went cold turkey. Started on a three day weekend to avoid work stress at the start. Didn't go to the bar like I would on a weekend, no alcohol at home either. By the time I was back at work the next week I had three good days to build on.

Probably biggest key for me was a calendar I printed and carried in my pocket. Each day I would mark off another day of not smoking. When I got the urge I took the calendar out and looked it over and reflected on how much time I had already spent quitting. And it gave me something to do with my hands."well i was going to get some troubles in a favela and a bad guy with a gun said me..why do you smoke cigarettes? youå«re gonna die...i quit in 10 seconds..."I smoked about a half pack a day from age 16 - 22. 

When I quit, I grouped it in with a bunch of changes I made in my life. Just finished college and I moved back in with my parents for a bit. I decided I didn't want to smoke anymore. It helped that I added a bit of physical exercise and had totally different surroundings. 

Now, 2.5 years later, I still smoke socially (usually while drinking with smoker friends), but it's very rare and I don't enjoy it like I use to. Cigarette smoke still smells heavenly and I crave and romanticize the feeling of conversations over a smoke, or having an excuse for a break, or just the feeling of lighting one up and taking that first drag. 
"I stopped smoking in the house... During Winter...... And refused to wear a coat... as it got colder.. the faster I put out the cig... the less I smoked... the less I went outside... Went from 2 packs a day to 2 cigs.. Then I just said WTF is the point in 2.... Been a NONsmoker for 7 years"Partially because my girlfriend hates it,  and I felt stupid trying to subtly disappear from her kids when I wanted to smoke. 

I did it by not quitting. I kept 2 cigarettes and a lighter on me ask the time I'd stopped.  That way,  it wasn't that id given anything up,  I could smoke anytime I wanted..  I just chose not to for that moment in time.  ""Check out the ecigs subreddit.  All kinds of help there.  I've been smoke free, off of a pack a day since March 2013.  Electronic Cigarettes are what I have to thank.  It's become more of a hobby than a habit at this point, it's fun!  Rebuilding the atomizer coils, checking out all the new technology!""I got married, and the wife hated it, and I hated it, so I bought an e-cig, and after a year of that I started working out again. I found that even the e-cig made it hard to breathe. Several years smoke-free now with no desire to go back. I've made working out a central point in my life and anything that impedes my ability to breathe just isn't worth it to me now.""Smoker for 18 years here. I used the e-cig. Try Njoy...they look the closest to a real cig and feel similar in your hand and when you hit it. They're pretty expensive, but the money Is well worth it since nothing else worked for me. 

I needed something that felt EXACTLY like smoking my menthol 100s. Just make sure you have plenty on hand because those fuckers die quickly.

Keep going outside and treat your ecig like it's real - take that smoke break! ""I tried several times - in the end - I had to convince myself I didn't like the taste.

Been cigarette free for nearly 5 years now."Look up a book called Change Anything. A friend of mine said the strategy he was able to put together through this book was very helpful."I'm sure this will be buried. After attempting to quit multiple times, and succeeded for a few months, what actually worked was changing my mindset. Instead of quitting because it's bad or I was nearing 30, I saw it as leaving a toxic relationship. The problem with the other times I quit was that I loved smoking. So, like trying to leave someone you're still in love with, I always went back and missed it when I didn't have it. When I finally quit I had the talk ""We had a great time together, but you just don't fit into my life anymore. It's not what I want"". I mourned it like you'd mourn a heartbreak. Somehow the ""we loved but it's over"" mentality helped me get over it. ""Chantix - it really works.  Partial Agonist for the receptors that nicotine would use.  Blocks them so smoking is not reinforced, stops cravings, but doens't reinforce its own use.   You smoke while you take it and by the end you are thinking ""Man these taste like crap, and I'd rather go back inside""  Its actually a relief to stop smoking.


DOWNSIDE: Crazy dreams,  disphoria, and emerging evidence of depression and suicidal thoughts (and maybe more than thoughts) are all common side effects. Not all insurance plans cover it, and it might not be on  the market too much longer.""Was donating plasma for a while and caught a cold.  it nearly killed me. Quit while in recovery and haven't looked back.
I still have nightmares sometimes where I'm smoking."I got really really bad acid reflux for a few nights towards the end of my smoking and that's what made me just quit.  Couldn't justify smoking any more with those immediate effects."I honestly just got tired of smoking and the money I was wasting on it. I tried the lozenges and they really did help, once I got used to the clean nicotine feeling I hated the taste of cigarettes and their smell was atrocious so I basically turned myself off of cigarettes at first but I didn't quit nicotine. I also had an e-cig which I really didn't use all that much.

Other people I know used the patch its the same concept as the lozenges. 

Anyway once I no longer had a desire to smoke I basically just weaned my self off the nicotine supplements and I have been smoke free for over a year now. :)"E-cigs c/w nicotine."It was just time. I had always figured I would quit when I started having kids, and I never had kids. I had moved, and all of my new friends in my new town were non-smokers. I always figured the hardest part of quitting before was being around people who smoke all the time. I basically locked myself up for three days until the worst of the cravings had passed, drunkenly playing video games and burning a hell of a lot of incense. It made sense to me at the time. 
""Some advice, though may seem silly:
-Change your phone background to something that will remind you that you are quitting.
-DO NOT GO INTO CONVENIENCE STORES
-Ask your partner, if you have one, to support you and to understand if you are emotionally harsh during the quitting process.
-Each time you desire a smoke, remind yourself that you have done that in life and try to do something new, that you have not done. 
-FAP your desires away""I never was a heavy smoker, so I'm not the best to give advice or have the experience, but I did smoke almost regularly

It started as a fun ""cool"" habit... you know... standing on a balcony dragging on a cigarette while watching people in the street and running thoughts and comments in my head, that kind of stuff. I also liked how the packets looked cool (I didn't smoke a lot, so the expensive top shelf ones were affordable). Exams increased the smoking

Anyway, I signed up for a gym membership and went daily. One day I woke up and I just stopped smoking because I wanted my full performance (I do a lot of cardio, so every bit of air your lungs can manage matter)

For me it was the knowledge that cigarette addiction is mainly psychological (they say the cigarette is the biggest placebo there is) we make it what we want. If we drag to relax we do, for pleasure, after meals or sex... etc. The nicotine's effect only goes so far, and after a short bit the body develops tolerance, so that stuff isn't really acting the same way it was

Many of my friends gave up smoking for their first born and never gone back. One man I know had an on/off relation with smoking, giving it up for years then going back again for some more years... until he discovered he had bladder cancer he stopped

Also, childhood exposure to smoking greatly increases the chances of the kid becoming a smoker (I mean the habit, not just plain smoke). Besides the health damage the child gets, the sight of a role model smoking leaves an imprint in his mind that's difficult to remove

My advice to you is to treat it like AA treats alcohol. Seriously. Don't be around cigarettes or smoke, don't be in situations where there is smoking... avoid it at all costs, and inform people around you of it. Unlike alcohol, smokers would totally understand if you want to quit (unless you have really asshole friends), because they themselves want to get out but are lazy or don't have the will

It might be more difficult than alcohol, smoking isn't the same taboo as alcoholism, and isn't as confined too (people smoke on the streets and in offices, but don't usually drink in public like that)

Read on the benefits. I didn't find that reading on the damage helps much (your brain will always justify it like ""it's rare"" or ""not me"" etc), but our brains pick up more on the positive (everyone wants better teeth, breath, appetite etc). 

Have a strong will brother =]""http://amzn.com/0615482155 this worked after 13 yrs of smoking more than one pack a day

didn't even wanted to quit when i started reading it

threw my pack away by the middle of the book

been smoke free for 2 years, not gained weight""I quite cold turkey.  I would post the number of days since my last smoke on my gmail status bar (after I made is a couple weeks).  It sounds pretty lame, but my friends gave me some encouragement.  The aspect that really worked, though, wasn't the encouragement, but the social control that my posting injected into the situation.  I would have felt like a giant asshole if I had publicly sought the encouragement and support of my friends and peers then turned around and started smoking again.  

One of my friends even came up with an incentive system.  After 20 days she got me gum, 30 was coffee, 60 was beer, and after 100 days she was supposed to take me to a strip club and buy me a lap dance.  She didn't pay up on the last one, but I was pretty much in the clear quitting wise which is much better than two and a half minutes of sexual frustration anyway.  

Another thing to note is that after you quite for a while you will start to think that you aren't addicted anymore and you can have just one cigarette when you are out drinking or super stressed.  This is an illusion.  It will seem that way, but the time between each of these isolated events will get shorter and shorter until you finally buy a pack.  The day you wake up with a pack of cigs and smoke that first one of the day on the porch it is on and you are a smoker again.  You pretty much can never have one again.  

I still enjoy a cigar from time to time, but I find it funny that I can't finish one anymore without feeling light headed and nauseous.  I guess my body is back to recognizing nicotine as poison rather than a delicious ticket to flavor town. ""First, don't beat yourself up after each ""failed"" attempt, you just get back on the horse. Consider it a slight relapse. Guilt and shame aren't going to help. Good job on noticing your trigger. Try and replace those triggers with something else or avoid them if possible.

I beat smoking on my 7th quitting attempt. The one that stuck for me was the patch. I think the main reason is that it gives you a chance to change your routines (social aspect) and *then* it removes the nicotine dependency (physical aspect). You don't try to do them both at once. It's a way of gradually reducing the nicotine in your body so you don't have that ""day 4 hump"" where you would trade your unborn child for a cigarette. While on the patch, your are not supposed to smoke cigarettes. This rule was easy for me to abide by because having a cigarette would mean taking off a patch, which was enough of a barrier for my will power to kick in. By the time I was done the patch, my routines had already been replaced by new ones so I had something different to do after dinner, on break etc.

But remember, quitting is a process. You have to attempt many ways, reflect on why it failed, when it failed and try again with the new knowledge. Each time you try and quit, you get better at it. Seriously."Sinus infection. True story. Watching my dad slowly dying from COPD and thinking I didn't want that for my kids. Quit cold turkey. Go for Champix - honestly the best thing i ever did. Really worked wonders for me"Get a vapor. Smoke smart, don't smoke stupid. Also, the best money you'll ever spend. I smoked for 3 years straight pack a day smoker... I haven't touched a cigarette in 6 months due to vapors. So yeah... Smoke smart not dumb. I could go on and on.....""Honestly, I don't know what it was that triggered my decision to quit.  I simply woke up one morning after a decent date night with the girl I was seeing at the time and realized that I didn't want to smoke anymore.  I didn't have the urge, no cravings, nothing.  Went out with friends who smoked two weeks later and took a drag off of one of their smokes as a test.  It tasted like absolute shit.

So where I see it, while there is definitely a physical addiction portion to it, there's also a psychological portion to it.  Thinking that you want to quit is one thing, but having something there where you KNOW you want to quit is something else.  I guess the only advice I can offer is to keep to it and find that reason as to why you KNOW you're quitting.

Best of luck to you."A prescription for Wellbutrin. And a vehement anti-smoking boyfriend. For reals."I use a e-cig now. If you go to specialty shops, you buy the juice in a variety of flavors. I started out with 12mcg of nicotine in my solution, and I slowly widdled down to where I don't have any nicotine in my solution. I found that I was smoking when I was sitting for a while and needed something to do, or when I was at a bar. So now I just bring my nicotine-less e-cig along for the ride and it has helped me for the past 5 months.""I don't like the focus on HOW you stop smoking. What matters is THAT you stop smoking, because all strategies suck, but after enough time passes without smoking it becomes the most disgusting, repulsive thing to you. I smoked over a pack a day and now I gag when I even smell secondhand smoke. "Chantix + new non-smoking girlfriend within 1 week of each other.My freind started smoking weed. Got healtier and never smoked cigs again."I made the choice. As others have said, it has to be your choice, for you. I thought when my wife got pregnant, I'd be able to easily quit. Three pregnancies and nope, nope, and nope. Can't do it for her, can't do it for my kids. Sure, they can be motivating factors, but I have. to. want. to.

I was 41 years old. A computer programmer (so very sedentary). I ate poorly. I wasn't obese, but I was not in good shape. Saw a photo of myself that had been taken recently, and decided to get into shape. Or to get closer to it.

I started using the Wii Fit. I know that's not really ""working out"", but for me, it was better than nothing. And believe me, I felt it. About 4 days into this exercise regimen (along with changing my diet), I just... decided to quit smoking. 

Quitting smoking wasn't something I was going for at that time. I just wanted to drop some weight. I don't know if it was the fact that now I was ""exercising"" (or at least, moving), so i was feeling the effects more. I mean, let's face it. Sitting in front of a computer 18 hours a day, one doesn't really feel the effects of smoking.

But add a little bit of exercise/movement daily, and you feel it. You know it. And that was it. I threw away the cigarettes. And that was it.

I did go on the nicotine gum tho. And as ashamed as I am to say it, I was on the nicotine gum for 2 years. Kept rationalizing that it wasn't as detrimental as smoking. And while that may be true, I've been off of the gum for 2 years. It's incredibly rewarding/liberating to be free of the need for nicotine in any form. No more panicking when I leave the house, worrying whether or not I brought the gum, or enough of the gum. 

Anyway...

Talk to some ex heroin addicts or ex meth addicts. Their stories will humble you (I bet you never sucked someone off for a smoke).

Just tell everyone you know you are quitting, you will have lots of accountability and a licence to be a raging prick for a month and have people support you and congratulate you in your pricky-ness.

My tongue instantly started to swell up, making it difficult to breath - a condition called angioedema. I threw the cigarette out the window and never smoked again. I'm not sure if the cigarette was the cause, but it scared me enough that I had no trouble quitting and never looked back. The fear of suffocating on your own tongue is a pretty strong motivator, I guess.""http://whyquit.com/

No lies, no patches, no gum, no bullshit.""I smoked for 10 years. Got up to a pack and a half a day. Smoked American Spirits because fuck additives. Went to the doc for a cyst on my armpit when I was 26. Turned out to be Hodgkin's lymphoma. Started chemo 3 weeks later. Didn't wanna quit but the Bleomycin fucks your lungs up. So had to quit. Doc gave me Chantix. I took it for a week but stomach and sleep problems made me quit that quick. Been cancer and smoke free for almost 6 years. So yeah, just get cancer.

But the ABVD chemo treatment definitely helped me quit.)""Smoked only when I drank alcohol, nights.  Quit drinking alcohol but started smoking anytime.  Asked acquaintances if they used to smoke and how quitting occurred for them.  One day it occurred to me that I might not have to smoke that day.  Around 11pm I had a cigarette and felt loss and sad - I couldn't even go a day without smoking.  A new voice came to the stage.  "" 23 hours is really good"" and the feeling changed returned to 'maybe this can occur.'  When another day came of the possible feeling of power to quit occurred I used one of the quitting strategies given by my interviews - to stay in bed for a week only I changed it to a month.  One would be years ahead by making this one change.  Smoking felt like hell to me but I still did it.

I tried making it as much of a pain in the ass as possible so that when it was time to quit, I just stopped going out of my way.

I still smoke hookah once a month as a social thing, though. Not sure if that is hypocritical or not""This will probably not do you too much good, but I moved to a new state. I'd established all manner of places in Virginia where I would light up to the point where I would get my cravings as soon as I walked in the door. Moving to New York meant I had no place I associated with smoking, so it was easier to gradually wean myself off and ultimately quit.  This was back in 2001; I fell off the wagon for a couple months in the wake of 9/11 and a couple other personal upheavals, but managed to stop again when I'd gotten my shit back together.  I have had exactly eight cigarettes since then, all on the anniversary of my second time quitting for good (a little ritual I started when I was teetering on the verge of falling off the wagon again during another rough patch) and two puffs on a friend's e-cig just to see what it was like. I discovered that tobacco is effing amazing when you're having it because you *want* it, not because you're feeding the monkey.""One simple rule.  Stop buying them.

Wouldn't you rather live an extra 20 years?  Food tastes better, spring smells better, you don't stink, you don't taste awful, your car doesn't stink, you don't have nasty teeth, you age better, you don't have to buy them or stop to buy them, no social pressure, no sneaking out to grab a smoke all the time... you get the idea.  There are a million reasons to quit, and only one to continue, because you can't handle a couple of weeks of mild discomfort.""Not smoking (except while shitfaced drunk, it doesn't work if you set unreasonable expectations because once you break it just once it's easily over) worked for me, after a while I found the smoke disgusting enough not to smoke while shitfaced drunk."The patch."This is not a joke. It really worked. I was a 1/2 a pack a day guy unless I was drinking then it was a pack and 1/2. I used to smoke a small amount of pot and I simply decided to switch one for the other. I smoked more weed for awhile, but within a year I was back to occasionally smoking weed and not smoking cigs at all. It's been 12 years and I've never gone back to cigs. If I feel a craving, I smoke a J.....I simply can't smoke that much herb, so it solves the craving!""I did it for myself.

Find a reason to quit that's not external. Don't quit because your girlfriend/boyfriend wants you to, don't quit because you need to for your kids. I just wanted a lifestyle change. So i gradually slowed down, from almost a pack a day down to 5, then down to 1, then down to social gathering...etc. Instead of making myself quit completely at one particular moment, i actually let myself have one once in awhile for a year or 2, then eventually i just lost the habit cause it's gross to pick up smoking again everytime. I also picked up some sports (running, basketball, cycling) to keep my mind off of smoking, and the increase in performance and cardio over time was a really good motivation.

It worked for me, hopefully it works for somebody else. Do it for yourself!

Without the will it cannot be done.""There is no gimmick, no miracle drug, or an epic process.  You have to WANT to stop smoking.  Its an addiction, the addiction lasts 3 days (Nicotene takes 3 days to leave the body - Give or take a day), but the HABIT of smoking lasts for a long time.  I quit years ago, and the reason why I quit was because I no longer enjoyed it.  There comes a time when you realize smoking is not working for you, and that is the perfect time to quit.

I tried the patches, the gum, and LOTS of chewing gum.  If your mind is not set on quiting, you'll always go back.  The other problem lies where you associate a specific task with smoking - For instance - After dinner, or completing a task, having a beer, job well done victory smoke.  They all have to be replaced with something else.  I came to this realization when I was a week into quiting and doing my cars brakes.  After I finished one side, I started to look for my pack of smokes... Sure enough at that point I realized I didn't have any because I quit.  That's when I had to change EVERY habit I had that related to smoking.

Like I said, you have to be ready to quit.  A life changing moment helps - eg: A child imitating your smoking.  Heartbreaking I know, but it does spark your need to stop.

Good luck!

Smoke Free a couple of years.  Don't both tracking anymore because its not worth your time.""Hating it enough to stop, denying yourself the good ones (like after dinner or first in the morning) stop smoking inside and rewarding myself with something awesome for going a more than a few weeks without it. Avoiding liquor and other smokers for the first 5 months was essential for me. When it became less fun and no one socialised with me, it was so much easier. It's been 2 years and I only miss it when I'm really pissed off, upset or drinking too much. ""For the sake of all these redditors' health,
lets all wish that we don't find out in 10 years,
that the chemicals in eCigs are just as carcinogenic."You need to find out what is causing your necessity to smoke first of all. If you attempted more then twice and failed then it means you have more of a dependency on another aspect of smoking aside from the nicotine. If you do it because of a oral fixation then you need to supplement with a different oral fixation such as a sucker or hard candy. If its because of stress you need to find something else to stop the stress. The best way to stop smoking is to supplement it with a new sensation that is healthier.Wellbutrin."CHANTIX. so many reviews says it makes you crazy, but that's only a small number of people. it's worked great for me."I decided mentally I would quit and did. Used an ecig a first bit choosing to stop was it. I just did it. No try. "Necessity. I realized that my friends and family were not going to take the cash out of their pockets to support my habit any longer. So I quit cold turkey. Kinda helped that I had all the pot I could smoke though, anytime I had a craving, I would light up a joint and puff on that instead of a cancer stick. Worked amazing for me, haven't touched a cigarette in 3 years, but I've been smoking weed a lot more.. lol. I'm honestly OK with that."Embrace the pain and stop.  This is the only way. "The breakdown of what happens is as follows:

1 - You will have to occupy your mouth with either gum or E cigs

2 - When you go 3 solid days without smoke or second hand smoke you will breathe noticeably better.

3 - THE FIRST THREE WEEKS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT. If you can make it to that amount of time the rest will be smoother.

4 - Do not use Nicotine gums or inhalers, there's no point you will still want nicotine. 

AAANNND 5 - Understand that  you may still feel like smoking cigs any time while you are no longer addicted. That's how you know its not the smoke your body craved but the nicotine drug itself."Just stop. Make the decision and sack up. It gets easier with each passing day."On my 3rd attempt I read somewhere that a smoker takes on average 5 tries to finally succeed on quitting, that kind of took the pressure off of me. I thought, ""well if I fail, that's just part of it."" Also, nicotine patches helped me a lot, I tried the nicotine gum, but that thing was horrible. ""Electronic cigarette. Seriously, it made the process much easier than I anticipated. I also quit when I came down with a cold. I never liked smoking when I was sick but would do it a little anyways due to my being addicted and whatnot. Caught a cold and thought it would be the perfect time. Why not quit when you won't even want to smoke for the first three days anyway? That and I got some great advice. 1: You never NEED a cigarette. You have a choice. 2:When an urge to smoke comes on, whether you do or whether you don't indulge, that feeling will go away."Also BUY A GOOD ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE. They seem expensive but it's still less than smoking. Anything you find in a gas station is underwhelming. Head over to the electronic cigarette subreddit. It's a very active community with a wealth of information. Good luck. "I used a technique of mindfulness and neuropatheic conditioning. It was important ot be away of any sensation taking place in my mind, body, feelings or thoughts, as in Buddhism. To detect these feeling as pleasant, non-pleasant or neutral and the fact they are part of a craving is the first key. When I identified the feeling or thought or bodily twinge of a craving, I engaged on a ""reflection"" of why smoking was bad. That sounds simple, but instead of getting on the ""craving train"" I got on the other one and reflected on things like the cost, my health, my emotions, being mentally and emotionally shackled to it, untiil this process became natural and when a craving arose, I unconsciously did this and eventually the association stuck. It took a day to kick any craving and there were no problems as soon as I did it there after.""Started dipping instead. It's not better, but at least my lungs are getting a break. ""Learning to differentiate the wants and needs of my conscious mind from chemical dependencies and craving triggers.

Also, willpower. It's been 661 days since I have had a cigarette, and I still find myself reaching for one, or craving one after that morning cup of coffee or a meal.  Once you start smoking, you're a smoker for life.  You just have to be strong enough to resist."Willpower."Willpower.  I was in college, and broke, and I decided I needed to stop spending money on something so controlling and stupid.  I just quit cold turkey.""E cig did it for me :) still get nicotine, but at least I'm not inhaling so many toxic carcinogens. ""Started smoking in 1998 (18yo)

Stopped for a year and a half in 2001, because I was in love with a girl (patches for 2 weeks, almost cold turkey). The moment I left her I bought cigs. So, first reason for me was falling in love.

Then, in 2003, I fell in love again. This time however, I didn't stop, even if the relationship was much much stronger. I tried stopping a few times, using patches again. Ended up being so angry, agressive, dispiteful that I smoked behind her back for two years. She went far away at that moment (complicated). We were still together but I was living alone. Thus I smoked for 3 more years. She came back, and, after a few monthes, she left me. Never smoked so many cigs than at this time.

Since couple last monthes. I tried taking champix and it worked. I haven't smoked since a month. I was at 20 cigs a day, started champix and dropped to 3/d, then stopped completely both champix and cigs.

What I can tell you, it's all in your head. There will NEVER be a morning when you'll think ""ok i'm done"". **This wont happen**. You have to tell yourself that you're stronger than those cancerettes. To be honest, it's not worth the cost and you really don't need to smoke. Try imagining yourself not smoking, all the time.

I was smoking A LOT while I was playing Left 4 dead 2 (FPS, but as infected you have 30 free secs everytime you die. I used to smoke all the time, like 4~5 cigs each campaign [~45mins]). Imagining myself not smoking during games was hard.

Oh and, I shouldn't say that because it's not legal but a real hard trip made me realize how much of a waste I was smoking. That made me start champix treatment :)"Don't buy cigarettes and stay away from other people who smoke. Same as any other drug addict."I was smoking a pack of Black n' Milds a day. 5 Black n' Milds. 

I told myself how expensive my habit was, what I was going to do with the money, and avoided using smoking as a social excuse. My health wasn't even the primary motivation. 

If your workplace has more smokers than nonsmoker's, you might need a new job.""In my opinion its all about timing and mindset. I tried quitting many times before succeeding (at least 5-6 serious attempts). The first couple of times I was not 100% committed to stopping and therefore it only lasted for a couple of weeks. My mind kept putting cigarettes on a pedestal and I felt like I was missing out - therefore I couldn't stop. 

Then one day I came back from a trip to Europe and didn't really feel like smoking anyone. I my mind I finally realized that cigarettes are not good and by not smoking I am not missing out on anything. I don't know exactly what triggered the change in mindset - but I think I maybe just grew up and matured. 

After stopping I still had cravings and really wanted to smoke at times, but I was convinced that I wanted to stop. I think the change in mindset helped so I could satisfy my cravings with electronic cigarettes instead of real cigarettes. I used electronic cigarettes for 2-3 weeks before stopping completely. 

Now almost 1.5 years later I still have cravings sometimes. If they are really bad I will use one of my electronic cigarettes, but most of the time I just try thinking about something else and the craving is gone in a minute or two. 

Anyway I really encourage you to keep trying - being an ex-smoker is great!!! You will have so much more energy - and your breath and clothes doesn't smell... 

Best of luck on your next attempt!"Remind myself that I smell disgusting after a smoke."A pack a day here is $3670 USD annually. Unfortunately knowing this SHOULD be enough for me, as I can't even afford the habit. But nah. Not enough.  "Cold Turkey. You gotta wanna quit too."honestly.  My girlfriend.  I smoked and didnt care about it.  I wasnt like a chain smoker, but id go through a couple of packs a week.  Once we started dating, she expressed that she didnt love the smell.  I didnt really either.  And it just made me stop.  I will still have an occasional cig, but in the past 6 months I dont think ive had a whole cig.  "I caught a cold which turned into severe bronchitis and was sick for about a month during which time I had no desire to smoke. I never went back and that was 25 years ago.. "I moved to Flagstaff from Lake Havasu in the winter (it's hotter than hell there - I say that almost literally) and all the snow and below freezing temperatures at night had me smoking inside. Then I started having some mild asthma symptoms and ... gonna be honest, I've only ever smoked between 1 and 3 cigarettes a day (or a whole pack when I'm drinking, you know the drill) and as few as I smoke I just oughta quit. I took a benadryl every night to sleep for a week, and it wasn't too bad. ""I know this will be buried.....I stopped when I found out my youngest child had to be rushed to the hospital cause his grandfather (who smokes) had him jump into his lap, he sucked in the 2nd hand and it triggered his asthma and he stopped breathing. I was deployed when I found out and quit on the spot. Been clean for > 3 years. Its tough, I still think I want a cigarette..until I smell a smoker. ""Smoked for 6 years, often more than a pack a day.  Decided I wanted to change negative habits I had smoking was on the short list, read, ""the easy way"" by Allan Carr  helped reaffirm will power and stopped smoking.  Went out and got drunk that night, didn't smoke any cigarettes haven't really since.  My dad gave me this advice, "" when you stop worrying about how long it's been since your last one then you truly quit, if you're recounting how long it's been since you've had one, you still want one.""  Have some willpower you are a strong person you can do anything you want. ""I've tried quitting so many times but the thing that has worked for reals this time is being in another country where cigarettes are crazy expensive. I know this is very FWP of me but being on a tight budget in another country made me realize what a waste of money it is. Plus, none of my fancy new international friends smoke so being the only smoker in the group just felt weird. It's just put the wastefulness of smoking in perspective. I am basically telling you to travel internationally to quit smoking...um, hope that helps?""I may be a bit late to this conversation but I'll share my story nonetheless.  After years of smoking almost a pack a day and failing to quit several times I decided to try the laser treatment, whether it's  scientifically proven or just a placebo affect it worked for me. To control the habit side of things I would always have a bag of carrots/celery or gum with me,  whenever I would get irritated I would mix magnesium with some warm water to calm my nerves. February 16 will be 2 years since I had a cigarette and I am incredibly proud of myself. If I can do it anyone can."I bought a house and really couldn't afford to continue to smoke and live at the same level. I ate a metric ton of cinnamon candy and that helped."Try breathing though coffee straws, you will then realize what it would be like to have emphysema. Or become pregnant. ""Here my dads story: he started smoking around 18 and although wasn't really a heavy smoker he smoked quite a lot. One day at work, a customer came up to him and said ""you should stop smoking"" and just like that, something clicked and he stopped. He said that after stopping, food tasted so much better and you get a lot more flavors now."Vape pens and sunflower seeds. When ever I'm stressed I buy a bag of seeds and get my vape. Then I just drive somewhere quiet."I read the book, The Easy Way to quit smoking. I would read it every time I stepped outside for a cig. By the time I was at the end of the book I had to force myself to smoke the cig. After I read the last page I put out my cig and never felt the need to smoke after. I'm not saying this book will work for everyone. It just happened to be the thing that got through to me. It helped me debrainwash myself. What's most important is that you don't give up. If one method doesn't work. Move on to the next and the next until you have beat it. Good luck friend. ""I was a ""pack-a-day"" smoker. I went through a very stressful divorce, and found myself smoking a lot more than I normally would. I realized this one night while going through some old things that included wedding pictures, and photos of us together with our kids. Started to well up and then I reached for my smokes... It was at that exact moment when I told myself ""NO, do NOT let this woman get you down like this!"" So it was then that I made the decision to quit. I stopped cold turkey in spite of my ex-wife. I took the negative feelings and animosity, turned them around on her to prove that she was not going to control my feelings anymore... I use that as advice to other smokers in my family... Take the stress and negativity that CAUSES you to wanna smoke, and quite in spite of it!""my boyfriend called me his baby-carrying-machine, and that he wouldnt have it.

Yes i know that is terrible but after my cigarette carvings ceased i slowed down on the pop and i am now down to a soda occasionally.you need to NOT WANT TO smokeQuitting adderall"My father-in-law is a 30+ year AA, so my in-laws have copies of The Grapevine (the AA magazine) in the bathroom. I picked up a lot of the AA stuff from that, and when I decided to quit smoking (after 16 years, and for the ump-teenth time) I started using some of the stuff from AA.

1) Personal responsibility. **Nobody** can force you to smoke. You have complete control over your hands' actions. You're not choosing to *not* smoke, you're making a conscious effort *to* smoke every time you pick up a cigarette.


2) One-whatever-at-a-time. For me at first it was one break at a time (at work), one meal at a time (at home), and one car drive at a time. ""I'm not going to have a cigarette *right now*."" Later on it was one day at a time, then eventually I just stopped thinking about the time. I could never see myself as a non-smoker, and I always wigged out whenever I tried to think about going through life with no cigs. But you can get through ten minutes. And if you can get through ten minutes, you can get through ten *more* minutes. But **DON'T** think about the twenty minutes! Just the next ten minutes.

You *can* do it. I have very little self-discipline generally. I smoked for 16 years, and I'm coming up on my sixth smoke-free anniversary in a couple of months now. You are motivated enough to ask for help from strangers. You can do it. :D"e-cigs make quitting FUN."I thought about it for a long time. I think I had decided I didn't like smoking probably at least a year before I actually quit. Then one day I was smoking at a baseball game, generally being disgusted with the cost and the habit itself, and decided I'd smoke the 4 or 5 cigarettes I had left then never buy em again. That was two and a half years ago. I still occasionally take a few drags off my friends' smokes (doesn't help that you can still smoke in bars here) but I never have the desire to smoke a whole cigarette. Even if I did I imagine my throat/lungs would tell me how bad of an idea it was in short order.""I quit cold turkey almost 8 years ago. 2 years ago I had a very traumatic incident occur in my life and I started again for a month and then stopped again. I find cold turkey works the best for me, replacing the oral fixation with dum-dums or other low calorie candy like Tic-Tacs also helped me. You just have to find what works for you. My dad had a heart attack from smoking too much and it was a few years after that, that I decided it wasn't worth risking my health anymore.""I just made the conscious choice to quit.  I actually kept going on smoke breaks with co-workers so that I could breathe the second-hand smoke.  I would go outside and breathe deeply to simulate everything about a smoke break but the smoke.  After about 2 weeks of doing that I felt like an idiot and I stopped doing it.  Cravings suck but they stop being intense after a week or so (I was never a super heavy user but enough that I still feel the pull on occasion).

I still have a cigarette once every two weeks or so.  I've been maintaining that for years now.""Woke up one day and thought to myself, you know what ? fuck it you're better of without them, never regretted that decision"An E-Cig will work for anyone who tries it and gives it a fair chance. And not a shitty ecig like a BLU or something you buy in a gas station either. I'm talking like an eGo or a lavatube or something similar. I've been vaping for like 4 years now and I love it. I haven't touched tobacco since. Willpower. No pill or patch will make you *want* to quit. If you can't tell yourself you will never smoke a cigarette again you won't be successful. "I started jogging regularly since I was out of shape and hated every second of it, quitting was easier (not easy by any stretch). I knew that Every cigarette I didn't have made jogging just a little easier each time.   

There was also an underlying notion that I wasn't quitting, I just didn't want a cigarette. I think it was getting used to legitimately not wanting a cigarette (due to aerobic health for jogging) that really helped. ""You just gotta want it.

NYE 2010-11 I had worked myself down to a cigarette maybe once a day or 2. Making it through the party without a smoke showed me I could make it.

3 Months later, and super drunk. I took 3 drags, never felt worse in my life, every time I smelled a cigarette lead to nausea...there was the nail in the coffin. 

Finally, the price got me to stop BUYING the damn things. In Chicago, the prices and taxes keep going up. Hell, I remember growing up in Ohio, $5 could get you a pack of Marlboro Reds and a bottle of coke and you were good to go! In Chicago, be ready to drop $10 on the cigarettes alone.

Of course, i was bumming them left and right, then guilty conscience kicks in and you buy a pack for a night out and give them out to friends who helped you out. Not exactly a great formula to quit, but it helps ease off it.""I watched a friend run a marathon and set the goal to run with her the following year. Once my mileage started to increase, I wasn't able to keep smoking and running. So I quit smoking. The coffee cup filling phlegm ball I hacked out one day helped my resolve as well.

Then I sold it!Getting violently ill with pneumonia not once but twice and being completely unable to breath. Pneumonia. "I simply calculated how much smoking cost me per year.
My advice is to smoke, smoke until you find your reason to stop! Once you find YOUR reason to stop will it be relative easy. Do not step down, buy patches or so, simply stop! Stepping down, using remedies will only result in you thinking about smoking ALL the time, and will eventually make you fail, instead simply stop, and when a though about smoking pops into your mind, just push it away with ""I don't do that anymore"", and get on with your daily day.
Lastly, do not change your habits right away, if you used to go out with your friends smoking, keep doing that, just donÛªt smoke!
I used to smoke 20 a day, 40 when I went out drinking, I stopped cold turkey, and I have not smoked once in 5 years now.
Be prepared to take 1 or 2 days off sick, after day 2 of being smokeless, but after that will you be fine. That habit and craving of smoking disappeared for me around month 6, and was completely gone after about 1 year. Trust me if you can make it the first week, then can you make it in the long run!

Just stay with it, seek support, and talk to your doctor if you think you need medication to help you quit. "The ecigs did very little to help me quit. They actually disrupt the quitting process. What I did was buy snus no spit tobacco pouches and used them when I simply couldn't take not having nicotine. And I'd buy a pack of herbal cigarettes to help me. I would try cutting your cigarette intake in half over a month then graduate to only one smoke a day. Then after awhile stop completely. I stopped smoking that way and I didn't even want a cigarette even when I was drinking and people around me were smoking. The key is never pick up a cigarette again after that!! It only takes one (even though after awhile of not smoking it will taste nasty and maybe give you a headache) to ruin the whole process. "Slowly isolating parts of my life as ""smoke-free,"" and then moving in with my girlfriend. 

I never smoked around family, to hide it. Then I stopped smoking in graduate school because of how I wanted to be perceived. Once I moved in with my girlfriend (who hated that I smoked), I eliminated 95% percent of the places that I was regularly smoking, considering them off-limits. 

Two factors, then - cordoning off areas of my life that I associated with not-smoking, and the support of a loved one. ""One of the first times I was hanging out with this girl I really liked, she mentioned she wasn't really a fan of smoking. At the time, she didn't know I smoked. I decided I liked her a lot more than smoking and quit. And now we're married, so I think it was a wise choice. ""I pulled a calculator and totaled my cigarette expenses for a year. Once I saw how much it was costing me, I quit cold turkey. That was over 10 years ago. Haven't smoked since then.""I quit cold turkey, personally I think that is the only way to do it really. I also had VERY strong motivation (another vital ingredient in the recipe for success). Went from smoking compulsively, usually 2 packs a day. I removed myself from all of the smokers in my life, and found things to distract myself with. The first 5 months I'd say were truly the most challenging because you still have that physical urge to smoke; to reach up to your mouth and take a drag, to slowly exhale. Once you overcome  the purely physical aspect, you have to be really on top of your game to not allow yourself to justify smoking again, even just one (or a cigar or whatever) because if you compromise once, your conviction to quit gets weaker and weaker. Coming up on 4 years without a single puff, and that's something I am proud of. My mother is a 45 year smoker and she got throat cancer two years ago. Still hasn't quit. I know I will see her in an early grave because of it.""health-care worker here too. (paramedic) my partners would always smoke and that eventually got me to smoke unfortunately. after about 2.5 years and many failed attempts, the only thing that helped me quit was cold-turkey, and extra motivation from the GF. she didnt like it, but put up with it. I wanted to make her happy, so that desire put me over the edge to keep cleen cold turkey."Ex gf told me I wasn't getting any more bjs from her if I didn't quit. Pretty much went cold turkey right there. "Ex corn cob pipe smoker here. Willpower, just willpower. Some people have it, some people don't""Very short jogs.  Every evening, I would jog until my lungs hurt.  This usually took 15-20 minutes.  But, when I wanted a cigarette during the day, I would remind myself about how much unpleasant my jog would be that night, and that was enough to get me through 80% of cravings.  The other 20%, the ones I gave in on, I didn't beat myself up, I just jogged longer.  ""Patches worked just fine for me. Plus, awesome dreams. ""Cold Turkey.  I had the flu and was so sick I couldn't even get out of bed for a smoke.  When I recovered from the flu, I thought ""well, I went a week without smoking, time to grow up and kick the habit"".  To this day, the smell of tobacco grosses me out.  ""A combination of things - I wanted to quit. I didn't want to have that ""heavy chest"" feeling in the morning. I left India to move back to the US and promised myself that the moment I would board that flight I would never smoke again, and it worked.

But the thing that i think did the trick was getting away from the company of people who smoke. All of my friends smoke and they don't really buy into the notion that ""Hey X is trying to quit lets not smoke around him"". They instead expect X not to be around the when they smoke. 

Long story short - it's boring to smoke alone so I quit. Now I just don't have the urge to smoke at all, even in the presence of other smokers. Had no withdrawal even though I had smoked for around 8 years.""using an e cigarette....I don't smoke cigs anymore I save money and feel healthier.  still waiting to find out what the negative side effects of vaping are but until then I will enjoy doing it.

He had to go in for a few different surgeries (unrelated to smoking), and it took a toll on him. He realized he needs to quit smoking and get in better shape. So to help him out, I decided to make a deal with him and quit as well. The will power of two, is better than one. Best of luck!""Non smoker here. My wife was a smoker for 14 years. She was able to finally quit once SHE wanted to quit. I tried to get her to quit for years, but she wasn't ready. She needed to be ready to do it herself. Once she was ready, she used the patches and hasn't turned back since."I got serious about getting fit. Having a high intensity workout like a Crossfit WOD absolutely destroy me was all the motivation I needed to leave smoking behind. Worked for my wife too about a year later. It wasn't just about quitting smoking. It was about choosing a lifestyle that was incompatible with another. "For me - a combo of:

*Genuinely wanting to quit
*slowly decreasing by having my first cig later and later in the day
*not making a big deal and deadlines and rules, just naturally organically choosing to not have another cig

Especially that last one!"I moved to Denver. The combo of walking upstairs/a small hill making me out of breath and being able to smoke a teeny bit of weed every time I wanted a cig helpedme get it done!"My Dad went cold turkey and hasn't touched one since (probably 8 years since quitting). He wanted to do it and learnt how to vent his stress somehow. He can't stand the smell of someone smoking now, we refer to them as cancer sticks.

My stepmother told me that he would smoke without even being aware of it. He would even smoke in the shower according to her. He quit cold when I was about six, sixteen now. I had always been telling him to stop, since I understood it was bad for him. 
To give him credit, he never smoked in doors or around me as far as I have been told. But I only spent every second week end with him.
So one day, he looked in his pack and realized he only had one left. So he went for a walk, smoked it, and never smoked again. Whenever I 
think about it I feel proud.

However, I am planning on moving to e-cigs and giving them a shot, I'm trying to get in shape and be healthier in my life, I've changed a lot of bad habits recently and whilst I don't want to quit entirely, removing tobacco from my life would be a step in the right direction.""Do yourself a favor, and visit /r/electronic_cigarette - I am 3+ months smoke free, with the proper hardware, you will NEVER go back.""I see a lot of ""you have to want it"" style posts in this thread.

Start of last year i made the new years resolution to quit. I ate some mushrooms, went to a concert with the old lady, and after my trip ended I didnt have any cravings. I could drink, and do some other things that used to trigger the habit, but after the trip and going in with the mindset I had.. it all just worked out. As of January 1st 2014 I had gone a whole year without a cigarette. 

Though when i go to beer tastings in the summer, I do enjoy having a nice large cigar as i walk around and sample different brews.""Hi, I'm 20 years old, I was a smoker for three years. I started in highschool when I was working as a waiter, and when I wen to college and started drinking more and living on my own my smoking habit increased to the point where I would smoke a pack and a half a day But I was never physically addicted, I would just smoke when I was bored to kill time. What worked for me was just not buying cigarettes. I haven't had a cigarette in two months. I suggest just not buying cigarettes, not having a pack with you really makes you forget about the urges to smoke, and eventually you don't want them at all. "Is your name Chris Simpson?"Wife got pregnant, and we had a kid. Time for both of us to quit after that."POVERTY.A friend of mine used hypnotherapy. He didn't believe in that kind of thing and yet it worked.My mother quit smoking after one session of hypnosis. My father quit smoking after taking Chantix for a couple weeks. No bad side effects for him thankfully.The best advice is that you have to *keep on quiting*. It takes practice at quiting. You've failed before but you're probably getting better at it. Each time I quit I learned something else."I made the firm decision within myself that I would never even so much as take another drag, and not accept any excuses for doing so. It was a rough month or so but that attitude combined with regular exercise got the job done.""I was 24 and smoking a pack a day and had started smoking when I was 13.  I had been trying to quit for 3 years; I succeeded quitting for 4 months, fell off the wagon, 6 months, fell off.  Always, I fell off after a great meal and a drink, every time.

Taking a summer Biology class at Uni (3 hours for each day of class) our prof was working on his PhD; he knew his shit cold.  My brain would hurt after class because he would speak quickly and coherently and hold our interest throughout each class all through the class.  He would see a good size contingency of us smoking at the mid-class break and one day he explained that he was going to devote 1/2 the class to describing in perfect detail and with crystal clarity the effects of smoking on the body (vasoconstrictor, carcinogens, tar is like Saran wrap on the capillary-dense alveoli thus starving all the cells in the body of crucial oxygen, etc).   

After that, each time I would light up I couldn't help but visualize everything our prof had described.  Over the course of a week I went from not really being able to enjoy my smoke to putting them out half way through to just not smoking one that day.  2 weeks later I tried smoking after a big meal and a few drinks and I was shocked to find that it caused me revulsion.  It was easy.  I simply no longer wanted to smoke.

tl;dr: I learned to visualize the adverse effects of smoking and quit smoking without even trying.  The real struggle would have been continuing to smoke."Meeting my wife. On our first date we went hiking and by the time we got back to the car I was so out of breath I could barely walk. I decided right then and there to quit. There was something about the fact that I couldn't even enjoy a walk in the woods that made it click in my mind that I couldn't keep doing this. I quit cold turkey and I've been smoke free for 9 years. "Ecigs, last March I made the switch and found /r/electronic_cigarette and I have not looked back since."I recently quit 2 months ago cold turkey. Something just clicked and I really have no need or want anymore. (Smoker for 6 years...I quit once before for a year but hopped back on the bandwagon in 2011 when I went to england) "I tried the patch the first time I quit. I stayed quit for 4 years. The next time I was so frustrated, I said, I've got to do something so outrageous that it will be like an investment of ego and a reminder as to why I quit. It sounds crazy, but I shaved my head! Prior, I'd always had long hair. That was about 30 years ago, I've never smoked again. I'd been a smoker for about 20 years and was at 2 packs per day! BTW, still have the bald head. I actually ended up liking it!
""Chantix. Plus, thinking about how much money I was wasting on killing myself. It helps that packs are now two dollars even more expensive than when I quit. Never again."Start running."Naww man, don't let these sissys get to you. You just keep on smoking, its good for you, and just think, if you keep it up long enough you can join the order of non breathers like me. You think its tough to quit now? Shit, it's a breeze when you cant breathe. And just think how this improves your sex life, when you go down on your old lady with a cannula in your face and have to deal with hoses and and all the cold bursts of air into delicate warm places its not meant to be. But maybe you like being hitched to some machine like a dog on a leash. FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE! You think cigs cost you, wait till you have to pay to breathe. You say you work in healthcare, go visit somebody on a respirator in the hospital, and get to see the trapped rabbit look in their eyes, their hands tied to keep them from damaging themselves. Thats your future. Aw never mind I'm just pissing into the wind here because there ain't no magic genie. Its all up to you.""Getting pregnant. I figure I've gone 9 months without, I can just keep going!"Marriage. I got married. My wife told me to stop. I stopped. Whipped."I was never a heavy smoker, but smoked probably a pack a day. I lost my dad to a heart attack at age 46 and a good family friend to cancer, both were smokers. This all happened in high school for me and yet I still smoked in college. I am blessed to have some truly awesome friends that I meet in college, most are more intelligent than me and they were primarily not smokers.

One day after college still rooming with one of my best friends, I noticed he ordered a sonic care toothbrush, he probably is one of my smartest friends, but also terribly lazy. I took it upon myself to give him some crap about how he was to lazy to brush his teeth to which he replied ""No, I just want to have my teeth for majority of my life"". That statement got me to thinking first I need to get a sonic care toothbrush and by smoking I am shorting my life expectancy. I wasn't really worried about cancer or a heart attack, but still acknowledging that my non-smoking friends will out live me and I would hate to miss out on years of my friends. Also my mom rightfully so is majorly against smoking.

I quit cold turkey. it sucked. You have to want it for yourself and not from someone else. Quitting should be a selfish act.

Edit: I had nightmares after quitting about casually picking up a cigarette and starting smoking again."Asthma. Switched to chew for a while. Didn't like it. Tobacco free (including blunts) for eight years. Getting sick really helps change your mind. After dealing with a crappy throat infection i never really found the urge to smoke after."You just have to decide that you already quit.  Quitting isn't a process, you either quit being a smoker or you didn't. 



No tricks, medications or alternatives will work if you still identify yourself as a smoker or someone who is quitting smoking.  



It takes about 18 days for something to become a routine, you just have to grin and bare it for 18 days and then not taking smoke breaks will be natural to you. 



Work is also my trigger for smoking, but we have to admit it's a pretty lame excuse for smoking.  Get up walk around, get a glass of water, use the bathroom, wash your hands; just don't go outside for a smoke because you already quit that shit. 

""So after over 8,000 comments, this is getting buried but I wanted to share what my husband told me. I had told him before we started dating that I didn't want to date a smoker and he had actually managed to keep it hidden from me for the first 4 months that we were dating. He lived in a house with 3 other smokers so it was easy to hide. He quit smoking right before we got engaged because he didn't want to be getting married and still be smoking. He says that he managed to quit smoking because when he bought his last pack, he *knew* it was his last so he enjoyed it. And when he got to the last cigarette, he told himself that it was the last and he just sat back and enjoyed it. And once it was done, he told himself, okay, that's it, I'm done. He hasn't smoked in nearly 4 years. ""I actually wanted to stop rather than just pretending that I did. E-Cigs help the urges, and bum cigarettes when you have the urge rather than buying a brand new pack, it makes you feel scummy for bumming and that turns the smoking experience into a negative thing.""I had smoked for almost 15 years when I decided to quit. Didn't even try anything else, went to a doctor and got a prescription for [Zyban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion). It worked like a charm until a couple of years later under some stress I found co-worker's cigarettes and decided to try one. 

About a year later and another Zyban prescription later I quit and haven't smoked since. It's been four and a half years. 

My girlfriend quit four years ago by reading this book: [The Easy Way to Stop Smoking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Easy_Way_to_Stop_Smoking) by Allen Carr.  It seemed quite easy for her, but I guess the experience is different for everyone.

EDIT: My girlfriend knew she had to quit when our daughter came to the balcony with her and took a drag on her marker. I quit because I felt my lungs were about to cave in. 

If I were you, I'd try the book first. It doesn't cost much and you get to smoke while reading it. (You get to feel good about making the decision to quit but still smoke for the duration of the book. Win-win!)""Laziness, it was easier and cheaper to stay at home than it is to get off my ass, go over to the store, and buy a pack. Rinse and repeat for long enough and you'll have quit cold turkey without even knowing it.""This is the best advice available to a smoker trying to quit. It's a proven fact that what I'm about to tell you has the highest odds of success when it comes to quitting smoking. I called the quit smoking hotline and the info that was given to me worked. What is the info?! SET A DATE! Setting a date to quit smoking increases your odds by 75%. Nothing gives you a better chance. Took me 2 dates, but it worked. In March 2010 I told myself I was going to quit May 1, 2010. I used the patches for 2 weeks and the losanges for in between 60-90 days. April 30, 2010 was the last time I smoked a cigarette. GOD BLESS YOU ALL!""E-cig and quarantine. Make sure you can't get cigarettes, and eventually the habit will evolve, I even like my e-cig better now.
Just remember: you're getting the nicotine.... you're getting the nicotine

""First, you have to want to quit. Don't fool yourself into thinking you'll be able to quit if it's only a half-hearted thought. 

Second, use an E-Cig. I know you said you had one, but you end up smoking real cigs anyway. Just keep it and have it and pull it out when you have the urge. It's definitely not the same as smoking a real cigarette, but I think it's more about the oral fixation and the nicotine fix than actually burning one down.

Third, Replace it with something else, at least temporarily. I started working out really hard when I quit and firstly, it felt amazing because I realized how smoking was really holding me back physically, and second, it gave me a place to burn that energy (for lack of a better word) that I used to put into smoking.

Fourth, and this may be unique to me, I quit at a time when my schedule was completely changing (when I started graduate school). It was, superficially, a dumb time to quit because it was the most stressful period of my life, but on the other hand, having a new schedule makes it easier because you don't have those ingrained ""smoke break"" times. So I got used to going to class, and never going outside to smoke, and eventually I just stopped thinking about it at all.

Fifth, if you have all the other factors lined up and you still can't really quit, take advantage of getting sick at any point...I caught pneumonia and physically could not smoke for two weeks -- that brought me through the hardest part because smoking simply was not an option. Then I just never picked it up again.

OH, AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY -- Again, this may be unique to me, but I have never told myself that I can never have another cigarette again. I knew that if I completely disallowed myself even the thought of smoking another cigarette, I'd obsess about it more. So I tell myself that if I'm out with friends and I decide I want a cigarette, I can have it, and I won't beat myself up about it. It's like a treat. And I've only done it twice in two years -- it clearly didn't bring back the addiction. And I usually felt sick after I smoked them (physically ill, not mad at myself) so that killed the desire pretty quickly.

Take your time. Do it when you're ready. You won't be able to quit if you don't really, really want to. ""switching to weed
""I quit while i was on vacation. Two weeks away from all of my friends and the smokey bars worked really well. 
Also you have to really want it. ""My last cigarette was while I watched Tom Waits perform. If I smoke again, I can't say that."I did a double strategy of e-cigs and nicotine patches. Now I'm just down to the e-cigs but will be phasing them out soon (the new boyfriend doesn't like that I puff them). I quit in October 2012."I owed my best friend money. She said she'd call off the debt if I quit smoking. If I ever smoke any tobacco product again, I immediately owe her the money back plus my DSLR camera. So, I'd be out over a thousand dollars if I ever smoked again.  

April 15th will mark my 6th year of being a non-smoker. ""I was tired of having to stop doing things for a habit. Cigarettes did nothing for me, so one day on my way to the ski slope, I tossed a 3/4 full pack out the window. On the way home I stopped to look for em and I realized I was digging in the snow alongside a road looking for cigarettes. Pretty shallow feeling. I quit cold turkey and never looked back. ""Quit smoking when you don't have routine ahead.
I quoted when I got married. We had our honey moon at WDW, so it were 2 weeks without routine ahead, and without smoking areas at every corner :).
Also, our rings are engraved with the wedding date, so I have the date I quit smoking on it. I don't want to get another ring with the new date.

Of course, after those 2 weeks I came back to work and it became difficult, but the ring thing helped me keep with it. Also, the hardest part (first two weeks) was over.

Yes, I replaced it with a lot of coffee, [mate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(beverage)), and food.. but I haven't smoked since, and now I'm starting to lose weigh again.

PS: sorry for my english""chantix, I didn't follow the directions.  I stop smoking on the first pill.  The 5th month, 2 months after you stop taking medicine, it was easy to be around others that smoked.  It actually made me gag a few times being around it.""Nothing really worked for me until I wanted to quit, at which point, I quit cold turkey.""1 year with an e-cig.

I slooooowly weaned myself off of nicotine using lower strength liquid.  Eventually, I got sick of buying the supplies (which were way cheaper than smoking) and gave it up too.""My friend says, ""I wanted to for a while because of my health and the money.  But once I got really sick with pneumonia, I realized that -- you know, that was the clencher.  It actually scared me enough so that I knew I had to stay away from it for a while, because when I was coughing I was in a lot of pain.  There were times I could barely get up from the bed without going into a coughing spasm.  So I actually was kind of scared into it.  But I also had the will and desire just for common sense reasons, as well.  A lot of people end up quitting because they're scared into it.

""The patch definitely helped.  As far as actually dealing and managing the cravings, I doubt I would have been able to do it without some kind of nicotine something or other in my system.  I did cold turkey once but it didn't work in the end.  And I think part of it is that it's just too tough on you when you do it without any kind of substitution or nicotine.  You can go for a while but eventually it'll catch up with you.  It's too tough.  The patch at least makes it bearable, because a lot of the reason why people smoke is because they get stressed out.  So if they're just building more and more stress, that ain't good either.  I got the script from a doctor so it was free from my health insurance.""
"I quit 25 years ago by stopping coffee with caffeine.  I used the American Lung Assn suggestion to shower an scrub often and drink lots of water.

Seriously though, when I quit the last time it was because I was sick of them. A lot of times before i tried gradually cutting them down, but going cold turkey was easy when I finally did it for good. Been off them for over five years now."What worked? My good friend got throat cancer. His brother passed weeks before for the same reason. I had to quit cold turkey. Been going strong since."The first few days and weeks are the hardest and then it gets progressively easier. So keep that in mind.

I was a chain smoker and it was very hard for me to quit. After a couple of cold turkey moments that failed, I got serious about planning. 

This was back it the earliest days of the internet, so I found pamphlets, books, meditations, etc focused on quitting smoking. Copied  lists of tips to quit smoking and made a whole file of them. This would be pretty easy today with all the resources on the internet. Created a bag of tricks (a literal bag) to carry around with me that included lollipops, carrot sticks, straws cut to the length of a cigarette, chewing gum, Niccorette and my file of tips that I printed out.

For the first few days, I went to the beach with my mom. She had always hated my smoking plus I knew she could tolerate me if I was grumpy.  It got me out of my regular routine and she was a great support.  I was still a total bitch to her.  She is an angel.  If I felt like smoking, I would get out my bag of tricks and start doing things from the bag until the urge passed. I used the Nicorette as my trick of last resort.  I also would just go to sleep if it got really bad.  

The worst times for me were driving and after dinner. So I usually had a lollipop while driving and would get up and do something else after dinner.

It was very hard. Temporarily.   


Within a few weeks, the intense cravings started to pass.  They would occasionally come up and surprise me, but it wasn't constant.

After a while they got less and fewer and farther between.

I haven't smoked in about 20 years.  I don't take the first puff. I don't hold a cigarette. I don't do the ""I'll just have one game.""  Everyone I know who has done that ends up smoking.

I still have the occasional passing thought that a cigarette would be nice. But I really don't miss the smell, the extra cleaning or the expense.  

Unlike some other addictions,  smoking  is one that will leave you alone if you leave it alone.  So the withdrawal is TEMPORARY.

I tried the e-cigs that resemble real cigarettes and i failed with those too, but after moving to the more expensive personal vaporizers that use the juice, i was able to quit with ease :)""I used the ego-T brand with the nicotine liquid inside.  I started with a strong nicotine at first and dropped to medium after a week, then low the next etc. They really do work and I'd recommend them to anyone who wated to quit.""I quit after thanksgiving 2012. I had just moved to California and decided that my coughing was so bad I needed to pick one, cigarettes or cannabis. I chose cannabis.

I stopped cigarettes cold turkey. When I had a really bad craving, I would smoke a joint instead.

1. I started taking Welbutrin for an unrelated medical condition, which helps get rid of nicotine cravings. I was still smoking while taking it for the first month or two without the intention of ever really quitting but then...

2. I was already cutting back but one of the managers at my work bet me I couldn't go three months without a single cigarette. He said he'd throw a party for everyone if I made it. If I smoke now I'll feel like a huge dickhead for letting everyone down. ""I'm an athiest today, but oddly enough prayer helped me.

I realized I had an addiction to smoking but I didn't have an addiction to buying them. So I stopped buying, and I changed my habits like needing to have a cigarette after every meal , drink of lemonade , etc.

I'm now 33 years old and no relapse as of yet. ""I stopped after 8 years, I was sitting outside of the coffee shop my girlfriend was working at talking to her on her break. I lit up my last cig and told her it would be my last. She didn't care that I smoked, I just made up my mind then and there. It's all will-power. I'm a stubborn person when I know I am right, and I know quitting was the right thing to do. I never physically felt like I ""needed"" a cigarette, but I wanted one really bad for the first couple of weeks. It's just  a simple decision you have to make and stick to. ""I went to the hospital to have surgery.  The surgery was a double bypass from my aorta to the femoral arteries.  The morning I showed up for the surgery about 5 am I sat in the parking lot smoking for about a half hour before I went in.  I knew this was a relatively dangerous procedure and I was concerned.  I had the surgery and while in the recovery room I had a heart attack.  The cardiologist said it was a ""righteous"" heart attack.  One week later, the night before I was supposed to go home, the nurse discovered an infection in the wound.  It turned out I had an mrsa infection and the surgeon told my wife ""this is a life and death situation"".  He opened up the wound and took a layer of skin from my left thigh and wrapped the plastic tube used for the bypass to try and help kill the infection.  I was in and out of a coma for 5-6 weeks in intensive care.  In the end the fix worked and I went home.  Had a nurse come in almost every day for several days giving me intravenous antibiotics for several months.  This wiped out the infection eventually.  Even though one of the nurses in the hospital showed me where the smoking area was, I didn't ask her,  I quit smoking quite easily.  Been 13 years and hardly a twinge of desire to start again.  Although when I find myself close to the end I plan to start up again.  Good luck.
Edit Add TL;DR. Went to hospital for surgery, had heart attack, got infection, mrsa cured six months later, no more smoking.

 ""I woke up for the Nth time in the middle of the night, coughing my lungs out with some nasty asthma attack and decided ""That's it, I need to quit""

Went to the doctor to ask for help, told him I had tried patches, gums, cold turkey to no avail and he put me on champix.

By week two, I couldn't even finish a smoke. By week 3, when I decided to stop completely, I had zero need to smoke even with my partner still smoking around me.

Now there are some side effects and you should make an informed choice, but talk to your GP about getting help quitting, it's worth it in my opinion.

Good luck!""I was a smoker for 9 years! Ugh I can't believe I ever started in the first place, the money we save alone on not smoking is astounding. I quit for two 3 reasons, 1. I did not want my daughter to remember her parents being smokers, nor did I want her around it in anyway. 2. My overall health. 3. Save money. I set a ""quit"" date in my mind about a month before so I could mentally prepare for it, mine was June 20, 2013 I also used a Blu electronic cigarette for that month with their PiÌ±a Colada flavor and chewing gum. For me it was surprisingly easy to quit, because after you get over having a real cigarette and having the flavored Blu it just made it so easy for me. I also firmly believe by setting my quit date in my mind and telling myself I was done forever made all the difference by preparing for it. I never had an urge to go smoke after that and still do not. The smell of someone else smoking now disgusts me, it just smells awful and I can't believe I ever subjected anyone else to it! I hope that helps you and good luck on quitting! ª´""13 years given up. Woke up and decided I hated smoking and was going to give up. Note not felt I had to give up but wanted to give up. Didn't tell anyone , didn't go out to the pub for 3 weeks. Went out and got drunk and didn't smoke and cracked it.

Tell yourself two facts to give up 

1) fibre glass in the filter makes your lungs bleed

2) smoking destroys collagen in your skin and ages you and gives you that 20 year older smoker look

Repeat those facts and you'll want to give up.

Go cold turkey and just avoid for 3-4 weeks. ""I am 5 years cigarette free, I used chantix. it worked great for me. I went from smoking 2 to 2-1/2 packs a day to nothing in 10 days. I haven't had one since. I did use peppermint tic tac's for a substitute (i read that peppermint is good for nicotine cravings) for the first 8 months after that I just stopped carrying them. ""I got pregnant,  29 weeks later still not had a cigarette the and don't intend to once my baby is born :)""When I was starting to think about quitting, I tested the waters by cutting down my cigarette intake. For example, I quit smoking while driving. Once I had re-learned how to drive without a cigarette, I began cutting cigarettes out of other daily activities. I know many people aren't able to do this, but it helped me a lot. One of the hardest parts about quitting smoking is re-learning how to do daily activities without a cigarette.  
  
Once I had cut down my intake to a couple of cigarettes a day, I quit smoking all together. It was hard at first, but I PROMISE it gets easier as time goes on! Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. You will still think about them on occasion, but it really gets a lot easier when you stick it out.  
  
I have tried Chantex too, though it made me feel weird both mentally and physically. My boyfriend had a bad reaction to Chantex and actually began to feel suicidal. I don't recommend that route at all. Though some people have success with it, I didn't like it.
  
Good luck!""I managed the first week by catching a pretty serious cold. From then on, it was just not wanting to let the ""head start"" i'd achieved slip away... 
There are some NLP techniques that I found very useful. Like phrasing your plan as ""I don't want to smoke anymore"" rather than ""i'm quitting smoking"". Silly as it sounds, I attribute my success to this kind of attitude shift.  I also set an alarm in my phone to go off every ten days to congratulate me on another ten days smoke free.  It took the weight off of knowing ""every monday,  it's been another week since I've had a smoke"". There may be slight stigma to walking outside and not lighting up, but I encourage you to take the break smoke free and have a walk around the block, listen to some music or something.  Keeping those breaks intact helps reduce stress that can make it harder to quit."Take all the money you would have spent on cigarettes and add that to your beer and snack budget. Worked for me. "The flu, seriously.  I didn't want to eat or drink anything much less smoke a cigarette for 4 days.  When I realized I hadn't had a cig for the longest time in ten years I decided to try and see how long I could go without one.  Coming up on my 5 year anniversary to quitting, one of the best decisions of my life. ""For me, it was something I knew I had to do. I was starting to feel negative effects from it to my lungs, and I just grew tired of them. I slowly smoked less and less until I got to a point where I said I didn't need them anymore and prevented myself from buying another pack. This was after 4 ""attempts"" of quitting. Quitting is all mental, and you have to truly want to stop for your own reasons."Allen Carrs Easy way worked for me    I used a prescribed tablet called Champix I think but took it back up again because I never bothered to change my habits. You really have to work on replacing your bad habits or making yourself realise your in one of those situations and to be mindful and show some willpower "I've quit 5 times for periods over 2 years. I've patched, subliminal tapes, hypnotism, and cold turkey. They all worked. They all failed. I'm smoke free 10 year now after cold turkey. Understand it's going to be tough and remember why you want to quit. Then use/ don't use something and quit. It's the best thing I ever did. ""My boyfriend quit using the nicotine patch. He had a really hard time with cravings and withdrawal symptoms, so he started the patch and it worked a lot better than cold turkey for him. He said that it made him feel like after smoking a cig, but all the time, so no bad symptoms. It takes 2 weeks for every step, but it's well worth it. He hasn't been smoking for a few weeks now and feels no withdrawal symptoms at all.""I bought a mountain bike, and the first time I rode I couldn't go 5 minutes without stopping. I quit that day and haven't had one since, it was over 3 years ago. Now I can ride for hours..."Come over to /r/electronic_cigarette! You wont *ever* want to pick up another cigarette after making the switch (with decent equipment) and finding what setup works for you"I tried cold turkey, gum, patches, nothing worked.  Then I switched over to an electronic cig (one of the expensive ones, I recommend [Totally Wicked](http://www.totallywicked-eliquid.com/ ).  After that, I could smoke anywhere because there is no smell, no second-hand smoke, and no possible danger or annoyance to anyone around me.

Then they passed new laws and the first time some self-righteous idiot told me I couldn't smoke my e-cig, I killed 14 people with my bare hands before I was taken down by a swat team.

Now I'm serving three consecutive life sentences in a federal prison, and it's extremely difficult to get a hold of cigarettes here - so I've been clean for a full 4 months!""I quit by using Cinnamon chewing sticks.  Sounds stupid, but it worked.

I was a smoke for more than half of the years I was alive.  

Now I'm left w/ a nail biting and chewing stick habit.""My dad and uncle quit a few years ago by making a $1000 bet with each other, the next one to smoke loses. The fear of admitting defeat to your own brother is a powerful thing, and neither of them have smoked in 8 years.""I had been quitting once a year for 14 years. In my current profession smoking is extremely common, high stress + frequent downtime make
s smoking easy, and quitting hard. Until I met a co worker who smokes 6 packs a day, no exageration. I told myself ""nope. not goin out like this guy"" and quit the next day ""Put the cigarettes down, burn/give away what you have left, and don't buy anymore. Best way is to not keep small bills in your wallet. You'll be less tempted to break a $10+ on em. You could do that for anything really.

I couldn't smoke then and when I got out of traction...I was cured.  Try it, it works.
"I figured it's up to me and nothing or nobody else. Just quit. Don't touch a sigaret ever again. Get rid of these silly mindfucks that make you find excuses for starting to smoke again. It's not that hard. It's your brain that's fooling you!"Probably not going to be very helpful but, I crushed my last pack of cigarettes. Then, I avoid friends who smoked and the places that I most often smoked for a few months. After about a year of not smoking I bummed one from a friend, because I kept being tempted and well I missed. Then I had that one and it was fucking awful. It hurt, it tasted bad, and made me feel lightheaded, admittedly I was drunk at the time and it was menthol. Since then I haven't had a desire to smoke. "Does overdosing on exercise help?"Every cigarette you smoke, you are choosing to spend one less day/hour/whatever on this earth with the people who love you. Basically you are telling your loved ones you don't give a shit about them.""One time when I wanted to quit smoking I asked my younger brother how he did it. At the ripe old age of 20 he told me, ""If you want to quit smoking....don't smoke."" I was like, ""Huh?"" He basically said all you have to do is not smoke cigarettes one at a time. Every time you want one you have to make the conscious effort to not smoke that very cigarette. If you do that, you can not fail. 

It worked for me the very first time...for about 6 months. Nine years later my girlfriend(now wife) got prego and had to quit. So did I. I couldn't imagine my future child seeing their (hopefully) hero smoking and thinking it was a good thing to do. ""This is hilarious in hindsight but I quit when I started working at a hospital and naively believed everyone in health care would judge me. 

Losing a close friend at 25 to cancer about 6 months later sealed the deal. Free and clear over 3 years now.""Cold turkey. It's the only way. Just have some self-control and do it. They smell like shit, taste like shit, make you look like shit, don't really do anything at all, etc. Just remember that you actually want to stop when you think about the need to light up. Just remember that your self-control is more powerful than the urge to do something you obviously don't even like. Every hour you don't smoke by simply not doing it is one hour closer to being free of it. After a week you'll hardly even think about it. After a month you'll totally forget about it.""I am convinced that it will only work if **you** really want it. All the magic cures in the world won't help you if deep inside you are not fully determined to kick the habit. 

The rest is I think a bit more personal and changes from person to person. What did it for me (I was in college) I started to row competitively, training every day. The big thing there was that it removed me from my usual pattern and environment, i.e. going to bars and drinking, where I was used to smoking. I also moved to a ""rowing"" house. Now, probably, changing your surroundings this radically is not an option for everyone but it made quitting ""extremely easy"" for me."Cold Turkey and force of will. just had to tell myself how much i wanted to not be dead by 30 or have to deal with lung cancer or emphysema "Willpower. Nothing else.

I have heard that Wellbutrin, an anti-depressant, is often prescribed for people who are trying to quit because it makes cigs taste like absolute shit.""I remember a long period of frustration with trying to quit because I knew no matter how much resolve I had by day 3 or later the resolve would always crumble. I started feeling very negative about the process of quitting, why I was a smoker, what was wrong with me and the anti-smoking stigma started to get me. I finally realized that I had the kind of attitude that left me vulnerable to failing because I didn't believe in myself. So switched my thinking completely, I praised myself for trying to quit and didn't take it personally if I failed. I reminded myself that it was ok to fail as long as I tried again. I even went so far as to acknowledge how much I loved smoking. I would think about why I liked smoking and appreciate the feeling of doing it, and just be more mindful as I smoked - instead of beating myself up over it. In the end I realized that when I went back and had that first cigarette after trying to quit, that first one never tasted as good as I remembered - it was kind of gross. For whatever reason becoming aware of the fact that that first cigarette wouldn't satisfy was what ultimately allowed me to quit - when I saw that being clean for two days of was worth more to me, it was a better feeling than that first cigarette. I treat cigarettes like an ex-girl friend. ""I quit cold turkey for 3 months, went crazy, got a NICE electronic cigarette ( almost 100 dollar investment, worth every fucking penny) and started vaping my brains out. You just have to not smoke. Period. Hate yourself for it, kick yourself. Just...don't smoke. Going strong so far for me at 7+ months""I did the ""ramp down"" method.  I smoked about a pack a day, so I started at 20 cigarettes a day, and then took one away from the daily total every week (So 20/day for the first week, 19/day the second week, etc).  At first, you don't even notice it.  What's one cigarette gone out of 20?

Around the 10-12 point, you start having to plan your day a little bit to make sure you don't run out before the end of the day. By that point it wasn't that tough to pull off.  The low single digits is when it got hard for me, so instead of smoking, say, 4 regular cigarettes a day, I bought the ""half sized"" cigarettes and doubled the number to 8, and resumed the countdown.

Once I hit the ""one half-sized cigarette per day"" point, I gave my wife a random number of them (something like 8-10 or so) and had her parcel out my one cigarette every day.  This way, I didn't know exactly what day it would be when I would finally run out, so I didn't dread it at all.  When the day came, she said ""there isn't any more"", and I was okay with it.  

After years of unsuccessfully trying the ""cold turkey"" thing over and over, this worked quite well.  I think it was the slow, systematic ramp down combined with the hidden drop-dead date.  Whatever you decide to try next, good luck to you!  Quitting smoking was one of the hardest things I've ever done."I got tonsillitis and smoking hurt. After a week or so the cigarettes just tasted like ash. Now I'm a member of Dippit so yeah. Get really sick. "This may sound horrible, but possibly volunteering on a oncology ward or chemo center may help closely see the end result of extended smoking while helping people that could use some help. Not everybody's speed I suppose. 

My father died when I was little of lung cancer. It took my mom getting sick and dying (lung cancer) before my cigarette show ended. Perhaps the volunteering is an easier way than the emotional trauma of watching a parent or loved one die. 

Know that you can do it. I tried for years and kept going back. Never give up trying, seriously you can do it. You'll love yourself even more and you are worth it. I'm a stranger and I believe this.

Non smoker for 7 yrs now"I began a strict diet the day I stopped smoking. I've had zero nic fits, and I'm cigarette free for 3 months now. I was a pack and a half a day smoker. I found that the craving for food was much stronger than the craving for a cigarette, and thus I quit and haven't looked back. My mind was consumed with thinking about what I could and couldn't eat for the remainder of the day.

Unpleasant way to stop smoking? Absolutely. It was torment (still is to an extent). However, I chose to begin smoking...I must deal with whatever I must to quit. Fact is, you can't expect it to be easy. No matter what route you take, it's gonna be a bitch.""The combination of working out and acid reflex. I have always been the type of guy that has been in and out of the gym for some time now, and never had a problem with smoking and working out while I was in my early 20's, but once I got to my mid 20's (which I am now) and started to run more. I realized that the smoking had to go. That and scaring myself with pictures of smokers lungs. I developed acid reflex, and I don't really care what else could come with the other terrible habits that I have. Now if I can drop drinking Monsters, and slow down on alcohol consumption then I'll be fine. ""I tried to quit numerous times, but I kept coming back to cigarettes, especially when I was around coffee and beer. 

I was working at a company literally across the street from a sports club that featured a 250 meter track, and one of my colleagues had started doing some jogging/walking over there. One day, I decided to see if I could run 250 meters without stopping. And I could do it! From there, I started running more and and smoking less.

I still hadn't officially quit at this point, but there was one day when I got drunk and had a few cigarettes at night. The next day I went for a little jog and felt like crap. Haven't had a cigarette since then. That was in 2011.

The first couple months after that were tough at times, especially when I was out for beer with my buddies who smoked. During those times, I found that this [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.EAGINsoftware.dejaloYa) helped me get through some tough cravings.

Best of luck. You'll get there.""Anosmia.  I got it as a side effect after I caught the flu once and it lasted for about two weeks.  I just didn't find cigarettes satisfying without being able to taste them, so I quit.  It'll be 8 years this March.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosmia""I got a real bad virus, my smokers cough kept waking me up. I realized I didn't want to deal with this every-time I got sick. Not sleeping makes being sick so much worse physically but even more so mentally for me. At least if I called in sick I could always curl up and sleep as a kid. I stopped while I was sick and never started again."I set a quit date and told it to everyone I know- my ego is a great motivator and it kept me accountable. I also did the FULL nicotine patch course to help with physical withdrawal. Almost 3 years now without a cig!For later reading. "I started for the exact same reason. Boss one day caught me out on a break, not smoking, so I started up for my breaks. Doesn't get much dumber than that. 8 years later I finally kicked it, after a few failed attempts. For me I kept thinking, is this the cigarette that will kill me? Every drag I took, I kept thinking whether that was the one that would do me in. Not so enjoyable after that. 

I haven't had a smoke I think now in 4 or 5 years and I still get the urge to, intermixed with being completely disgusted by the smell of them at times as well. "Vaping "Alan Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking.

Basically we create every moment for ourselves, if you don't want to smoke, the only thing stopping you is yourself.  You just gotta say to yourself that no one is going to be your master but yourself.  It is all mental.  It is about having respect for yourself, the little boy or girl you once were, looking at yourself from your younger eyes, and asking quite simply, why? Why am I poisoning my body that was once so pure and full of youthful promise?  Smoking is something I may have done yesterday, or even the past 10 years, but I can only quit once I realize that it is not part of my identity any longer, and that it is something I truly do not want for myself, or for those around me. Quit so that you may experience freedom.  Quitting is an exercise in self-mastery."I read Allan Carr's book twice and quit for only 24 hours after each reading. This fear then sets in once I wake up on a new day after quitting. This huge horrible fear that I can't explain. I then light up and have a sob about how weak and pathetic I am. "It took me 13 tries before I finally quit, and the only way to go is cold turkey. I had just grown tired of my lungs hurting all the time, so that was my motivation. Yeah, it's gonna suck for a while. You'll have cravings for a while, and it'll take months, maybe longer, for your lungs to heal. But eventually when you smell a cigarette or see someone smoking you'll have no desire to join them. Hell, I can barely stand the smell anymore.""When I was trying to quit, I would just want one cigarette. But, not wanting to waste anything I would smoke the whole pack in a day or two and soon need to buy more. The last pack I bought i gave to a friend who lived on the other side of town. If I really wanted a smoke, I would have to get my butt all the way over to her and explain why i needed a cigarette. I maybe had two or three from the whole pack and have never had another smoke in ten years. This, was just one element of my process, but it was so great to have a friend who was willing to help me and I'm so thankful for her.""I found that Sunflower seeds help tremendously, whenever I craved a cig, I just popped sunflower seeds in my mouth and the craving was no longer there."Replaced it with dip."My FIL, who was a terrific chain several-pack-daily smoker like-a-steam-locomotive since his teens, quit this way... 

He was whisked into the hospital due to heaviness in breathing. By the time he was placed on the emergency room bed, he was suddenly NOT ABLE TO BREATH. This bout lasted for around several minutes while he's already in the hospital. He thought at that time that it was his end. 
The good thing is there were badass doctors there, and luckily they did not have to revive someone who has just lost his ability to breath. 

Some few weeks after he left the hospital, one day I saw him drag a cig -- a big change since he used to smoke a pack per hour before. Days past by and all I saw is that he'll ask for a share-drag from his still smoking friends. Eventually, he totally quit smoking. 

Well most smokers cannot even achieve control, especially the chain smokers. My chain-smoking FIL managed to quit totally, after a brush with death.""Go to r/electronic_cigarette and really get to know mods and juice. understand the flavors and mixes and ratios.

I visited the doctor and asked for access to a public quit program, and it was all full up for the month, which pissed me off, so I just stopped buying them, finished the few I had, and stopped.  I had stopped before, but would go back, sometimes after years away.  Never used quitting aids.  Always just quit.  And I am told that those who quit cold turkey are more likely to stay quit than those who use quitting aids - or it was that way when I quit.

Best of luck to you, whatever you try, but the main thing is not to smoke the next cigarette.  The physical habit leaves you in a week or two at most, but the little manual habits of reaching for them at certain times takes at least 3 months to break.  Since 80% of people can't quit for a full 6 months, when you get that far, you can give yourself an A in this course!

""The main thing was that I was committed to the idea.  I started a couple months ahead of time, not by cutting down or whatever, but by picking a concrete date.  I committed to quitting on that date, and I told all my friends about it.  I knew that I wanted to quit for good, so I rehearsed the date like a mantra, so that it would assume the importance of a real, immutable Thing.

Another thing that helped was having some skin in the game.  I was a starving grad student at the time, but I bought a 50-pack of Nicorette which wasn't super cheap.  

In the end, it was pretty uneventful.  The day came, and I quit.  No looking back.  I think I ate a total of three pieces of the Nicorette gum.  Later that summer I gave the rest to a friend of mine who was quitting.    

Someone told me that the stages of quitting smoking go in threes: three days, three weeks, three months.  I found that to be a pretty good rule of thumb. The pangs went away after the first weekend, the low-level irritation went away after three weeks, and around three months was first time I realized that I had gone a whole day and hadn't even thought about smoking.  The next major milestone was going to a bar and not smoking.

I would always start out my workdays buying a fresh pack of cigarettes, I had an hour drive to work.. so plenty of time to smoke. One Monday, I just decided... ""You know what... I'm going to just not buy cigarettes today""... it was a half-assed attempt to quit smoking that I knew would never stick.
By the time I got to work I was really feeling anxious and kind on edge, if I had the pack then I probably would have lit up then and there, but I didn't. That feeling lasted for about 45minutes or so until I decided I needed to just find stuff to do at work to keep my mind busy and not thinking about the cigarette problem. I found that keeping busy, with a little bit of willpower the urge was kicked 100% in a month.

They had higher premiums when I smoked, so they offered me the difference they'd have to pay over a year or two period of time which came out to around $1000 to quit.  The qualifications for the deal were a)I had to be honest, if they found out I was being dishonest, even once, I would have to pay them back.  b)if I started again, I'd have to pay them back.  c)I was allowed 5 cigarettes a year.  This way one moment of weakness wouldn't blow the whole deal.  The first month after I quit I had 2 cigarettes when out drinking a couple nights.  In the next six months I had another one.  The next year I had 1.  I haven't had a cigarette since(it's now been over 5 years).  It was so much easier to quit when I could look at a cigarette and say 'it just isn't worth $1000'.  ""I used nicotine gum to quit.  I only ever chewed one full piece.  After that, I cut the gum into halves, quarters, then one-eighth and finally one-sixteenth.  In my experience, it is fundamentally important to only use the gum to make the withdrawal manageable.  Using the gum to make the physical symptoms of quitting go away isn't the objective so much as make the experience not as bad as it could be.  I would suggest you need to use a pharmaceutical product designed to help you stop.  I proceeded to dream about cigarettes for about 2 or 3 years after but eventually that stopped too.  I haven't smoked in the 13 years since.  The only thing I would do differently is talk to a doctor first, but all is well that ends well."Smoker for 20 years. Quit for 1 year about 15 years ago after a hypnosis seminar. Just quit again 5 months ago cold turkey after reading The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. Was on my phone before so I kept it brief. Any time I was not home was a trigger. I hid it from my wife and kids for a long time. I lied to get out of the house to have a cigarette. Work was the only place I smoked openly. It was pretty bad and pathetic really. One day the dog got into my work bag and I had a pack in there which my wife found. Not fun. That day I decided to stop lying to myself and my family and decided I was quitting for good. Found Carr's book and it opened my eyes. I quit the day I finished the book and have been smoke free since Sept '13.  Get the ebook on your phone. Read bits of it when you go out for a smoke at work. You'll finish it in a week and hopefully have your last cigarette at the same time. Good luck. "I got hypnotized but I can see how it doesn't really work and is really just an expensive conversation. Since I paid so much money for the session I decide that I would at least quit for the weekend, I never really thought it would work long term. I just took it one day at a time and tried not to think to far ahead. It really over whelming whelming when you start to think in terms ""forever"". I've come to the understanding that I will never be a non smoker but I am a NOT smoker. The same way that I choose not smoke, others choose to smoke. This helps me in social situations,  to be around it and not have to abandon all my friends. As long as it nt 10 people all smoking around me I'm fine.  I even let people occasionally smoke in my car on long trips. I smoked 1-2 packs a day for 13 years and quit almost 8 years ago. I have never once cheated because I don't know if I have it in me to quit again, although I do smoke pot. ""Smoke to get high not to die!!"" Keep your hands busy, berries are great anti oxidants and  Oranges are a great snack that keep your hands busy and acts like aroma therapy. Good luck to anyone quitting. It's truly the hardest thing I have EVER done. But it can be done if you want it badly enough. ""I smoked for about 20 years. About 2 years ago I decided I wanted to quit, so I quit. I just stopped buying them and toughed it out.""I watched as my fiancee's grandfather died of lung cancer, gave me the push I needed to be able to quit cold turkey after many failed attempts.""I think it was a confluence of different things, really, and I've mentioned them before and each time I think back I find this other thing. Anyway, it was when I found people who I considered totally uncool smoking. Suddenly, it was weird. That, combined with a whole bunch of other stuff, made me quit. Never again. Fucking shit smells."My way sucked but I stopped because I went to jail for some drug charges and was locked up for 2 months. After I got out I did not want to start cigarettes again and don't smoke."I quit 4 or 5 times (anywhere from couple of months to 2 whole years) and relapsed before final quit that stuck (18 years so far...)

I think every time you try, you learn a little more about what your challenges are, and you learn a little bit more about how to successfully meet your specific challenges.

My successful quit, I did a ""quit smoking"" program at Kaiser.  (I wanted to try the patch, and with my health plan, if I did their program, I paid my plan prescription price, instead of $120...)

1st week of the program was ""don't stop smoking, don't cut back, DO write down everything about *when* you want a cig, you're documenting your triggers...)

2nd week was ""Here's your patch, now don't smoke"".  In that week, I found that I wanted to smoke.  Somehow, this showed me that smoking was NOT exclusively about nicotine for me, and somehow, that broke the spell.

At least part of what contributed to being able to stick with it was that my kid had been asking me ""When are you going to die [from smoking] mom?""  Highly motivating...

Another help to me was that by that time I'd quit drinking...


Edit:  So, in the spirit of brainstorming your identified trigger:

* How long are your shifts?  
* Do you get ANY breaks?
* What's the rational (how does management put it) for ""people who need a smoke can have one, everyone else, get back to work!""
* Is there anything else specific you can add about that whole situation?

Perhaps one of us could come up with an idea or two you could try out to deal with the ""I really need a break!"" part of the equation!
"A lack of money did it for me"Honestly? I put joints of shitty mexican weed in my cig box and i just cut down. To the point where i was smoking 2 real cigs a day and like 10 quick joints just for the habit of smoking. The one day i had just smoked like 4 joints that day was super busy. I went to lay down and remembered that i hadnt smoked a cigarette all day. Jumped out of bed,ran outside and lit one up. It was freezing and i remember thinking ""Damn i didnt really even need this!"" Put it out after one drag and went to bed fine. 

Next day my buddy ( who hated me smoking) came by and on his way out i told him a quit smoking. He locates my pack of stogs and acts like hes going to crush them and throw them away. I said "" go for it, i dont need them"" . I asked ""really"" like 3 times then he threw them out. So that helped. I felt better that he was so stoked about it. Next week i started a new job and that was the hardest part. Smoke breaks where i just sat there instead of go outside with the smokers. Car rides were a bitch too. But its all stuff you just have to grind out. The nic withdrawal isnt shit, its just the habit of actually smoking that sucks. 


P.S. After 7 years of no cigs i did pick up vaping last week. i vape 0-6 mg nic. It might actually help you to try that. Get a Kanger Blister pack and some 18mg-30mg ejuice and just vape all day. $25 bucks and it will last you all month maybe 2 months. If you dont mind having a vice but just dont want to be all smelly and gross from cigs try that. lol. E Juice has no tobacco and vaping produces no smoke. Thousands and yummy flavors too. Just dont get those shitty ones that look like cigs. Get the pen ones. Blueberry cheesecake e juice is my fave. "Chantix - don't do it!!! Works though"I'm in the process of quitting right now actually, and I've been forcing myself to be as busy and productive as possible. I've been a perfectionist over school projects and asked for extra hours at work so that I have as little down time as possible. Its that down time when my brain starts getting upset and tries to convince me to break down and buy a pack. Early mornings and late nights are the worst, I've cut down on the money I carry to win the 'go buy cigarettes now' argument, that way I can counter with ""If I buy cigarettes now I won't have lunch or an energy drink tomorrow, and I need both of those, so I really can't afford it"""The patch. Buy the largest one and cut it to your needed intermediate size. Do this carefully. Stay on it a long time if needed."My father smoked for a long time and up until I was like 17. Then he got prescribed Chantix. Within i'd say 2-3 months he was completely off cigs and he never smoked again. He said they began to taste stale and then he no longer craved them. He also said while he was on the medication his dreams got weird. I think its best to quit naturally, if you can. But for those who need will power in pill form, Chantix seemed to do the trick."What really worked for me was never starting. Thanks D.A.R.E i guess. The lung they brought in that was all black compared to the normal lung was enough to convince me. Any method that works for you. But add exercise. Lots of it.I couldn't give the cigarettes power. I had tried to quit several times and failed until I stopped counting the days it had been since I had a cigarette. I quit a few months ago... yeah 3... maybe 5 months ago. There is still a half pack sitting in a drawer somewhere in my living room."Decided I finally really hated it and went cold turkey.  I joined an online support site that helped celebrate goals and that was quite encouraging.  In the past I had tried patches, acupuncture, lasers, etc.  But I found I just had to really want it and face the reality that the first two weeks would be hell.  But I did it, and so can anyone else who really wants to!"Electronic cigarettes are not shown to help stop smoking. So far I have just used straight willpower."It really came down to willpower and changing my mindset. Yeah, that's not an easy thing to do, but you can do it. Even though I am an emotional person, I also operate a lot based on logic. I wrote down my arguments for smoking (stress-relief was the biggest reason) and then I researched and rebutted each argument. Once I had it in front of me, crystal clear, that my reasoning was bullshit, there was no turning back. 

I didn't use any gum, medication or anything. I relapsed once. I realized how badly I wanted to quit when my reaction to relapsing was essentially breaking down emotionally. Been smoke free for like... 9-10 months now, I don't even remember. ""It wasn't just one thing that allowed me to stop. It was the combination of alot of things that allowed me to quit.
1) Higher Prices
2) I told my girl that I quit so I had to keep hiding it. Eventually, I just ran out of opportunities to sneak in a smoke. Next thing you know, months have passed without a cig.
3) I was on a health binge. I would jog regularly, probably 5 times a week. I thought it was stupid that I would go for a 3 mile jog, and then reward myself with a cig after finishing the jog. It was counter productive to try to run longer and faster and have my progress hampered by smoking."One day I just stopped buying cigarettes.  Every time I thought I wanted another I then thought if I still want it in a half an hour maybe I'll have one then.  Usually I was distracted in way less than a half an hour."Two things; my girlfriend demanded I quit and e-cigs. 

My girlfriend had been trying for months to get me to quit and it was hurting our relationship and I loved her too much. I had tried to quit cold turkey a few times but it just wasn't working. I saw people around campus with e-cigs and decided to give it a try. I started out at 24mg and gradually slopped down the nicotine over time. Towards the end, once I got down to 8mg and 0 mg, the flavoring of the e-cig even began to taste bad. So then I finally just stopped that. I'm about 4 months clean now. ""Was really trashed on beer and chain smoking while playing Madden online, before I realized it two hours later I finished a full pack of smokes. Got so sick the next morning, I couldn't smoke or look at a cigarette Again. ""Zyban. After 20 Years up to 2 packs a day. I needed to get off them. So I asked my doctor about Champix. At the time it had just been approved in Australia and she said that she would not prescribe it as she was a bit nervous about it.

She then suggested the ""other one"" Zyban. I had never heard of it. So I jumped at it. 7 years with out a smoke now. Worked so well my SO tried it and it work for her too. "my dad quit when he wound up in the hospital with pneumonia... he hasn't smoked since its getting close to 15 years now... shit time flies bro'sBuying packs of cigs that I hate the taste. I bought a pack of American Spirits 2 month ago and they are just sitting on my desk half full because every time I decide to smoke one I instantly regret it once I take the first few puffs."My ex gf offered me a bj for every day I went without smoking, she eventually got tired of it and moved it to a week but it still worked for me! God bless that woman :)""Started experiencing throat tightness all the time. Freaked me out so I quit. Smoked 6 years without symptoms. Before the tightness I was beginning to really feel out of breath as well. Year and a half later I feel like I did before I smoked.  
  
I slowly weened off until I got to about two cigs a day then quit cold turkey. Made it easier.""I just kept quitting.  Over and over again   Eventually the nonsmoking periods got longer.  Finally, one day I realized that I didn't smoke anymore.  It took many years.  It was awful sometimes, one of the hardest things I've ever done.  But it was the only approach that worked for me.  It's totally worth it, but I hope your solution is easier.""I was a pack a day smoker for about 10 years. I started to dip Copenhagen to stop smoking (I know, pretty dumb...) and after 4 months of only dipping I decided that I couldn't keep such a filthy habit going. I've been nicotine free for over a year now, but every now and then I get a mega huge craving to start smoking again. ""I took a half empty pack of smokes, stood on my bed and taped it to the ceiling under about 50 pieces of clear packing tape... directly above where I sleep. 

Reasoning: I knew that if I ever relapsed, I would have to stand on my bed and claw through tape like a fucking animal. That thought reminded me that I'm better than that."Getting pregnant"I quit cold turkey after reading Allen Carr's ""The Easy Way"". A loving friend sent it to me in an email as a pdf attachment one day, and I read it in an hour or so. I, too, basically immediately started saying ""I don't smoke anymore"" and immediately considered myself a ""non-smoker"" as I KNEW I was never going to smoke again. Honestly, it wasn't nearly as hard as I thought. I also told all my friends that I quit for good, which made me feel empowered and in control of the situation. Being around smokers actually made me feel better, because I felt even more in control and empowered over the situation. Good luck! A lot of it is a mental game. The physical addiction of nicotine isn't nearly as hard to kick as many other drugs...if you read that book you will see what I am saying! :) "Keep trying and trying. 5 times falling off the wagon isn't unusual."I've quit for 6 months now after trying to quit about 4 times. I think this time it is going to stick. 

People who have never smoked don't understand how much smoking can be a part of your identity. For me anyway, smoking was like an old friend, someone who was always there for me, something I could do to get out of awkward social situations, or have it as a sort of bonding experience with friends at a party or bar. I had to sit down and think long and hard about all the times I chose to smoke, and identify replacements for those activities. What was I going to do when I was driving, or drank coffee, drank some beer, boredom? I really had to make a plan of attack BEFORE those habitual situations arised, because once I was in that moment, the cravings would be near impossible to subdue.

Anyway, I chose replacements such as drinking a lot of hot tea. That is my new ritual. I also have an e-cig if I am drinking and I really want a cig. Just try to keep your mind occupied, and really be honest with yourself. Why do you ""need"" to smoke? 

Sorry for the rambling and not making much sense. This is just a topic with I have wrestled with for many years. I wish the best of luck to you.      "I purchased a Blu disposable E-Cig when i was fed up. after it ran out the cravings were bearable until much later. "bought an ounce of weed and rolled a ton of joints, plus nicotine patches.  Also got a tattoo.  As the tattoo healed I visualized myself getting over the buildup of toxins. Whenever i would normally smoke a cigarette, I smoked a joint. Haven't had a cigarette since.  ""My best friend had quit smoking several weeks before I did, I was sick so i couldn't smoke, decided it was finally time. Bought the 4 mg gum, stepped down to 2 mg, have never smoked again, it's been over 2 years now, i had smoked for 10""i have no experience personally, but my dad smoked for 30 years.  One day he caught a bad cold that wouldn't go away for 2 weeks.  His throat hurt so badly during that cold that he thought he might have throat cancer.  He made a promise to himself and god that if he didn't have cancer he'd quit smoking.  He didn't have cancer, so he stopped smoking cold turkey.  Lots of bitter korean mints helped him stay off.""Vaping. I am now a vaper and once I got myself a mechanical mod, I couldn't stand smoking cigarettes anymore. I then dropped down from 6mg Nic to 0mg nicotine and i feel great! ""I stopped purchasing and putting cigarettes in my mouth, setting them on fire, and sucking on them""I quit cold turkey about 9 years ago.  My now-husband and I had just started dating and he hated it.  He refused to kiss me unless itÛªd been at least 10 minutes since my last smoke, but at that time I was practically chain smoking so it was rarely 10 minutes from one to the next.  It might sound weird but I kept 1 cigarette in the box in the center console of my car.  I just didnÛªt smoke it because then IÛªd want to buy a new pack and if I bought a new pack IÛªd inevitably smoke the whole thing.  ""Personal vape/electronic cigarette worked for me.

But you need to buy a decent quality 'mod' (I use the itaste mvp) and good juice for it to be satisfying enough to help quit in my experience.""I just picked up dipping tobacco. ""Rock the gums, save the lungs."" I know i'm stupid for it, but it honestly wasn't intentional. I did both, and i found this amazing girl.. yada yada.. skip through time.. we're engaged. Well turns out she can't stand smoking, so, I just take on dipping full time.

I have a very addictive personality. Everything I do I become addicted. (gaming, food, reddit). But i think if faced with an ultimatum I could quit, I just like it too much right now.""It was relatively easy. After a certain point I just didn't smoke any more cigarettes. 

And i used nicorette for like two months" 2 packs a day was me. My advice. Cold turkey. Just say fuck it and dont smoke. Dont set goals for yourself to slowdown. Dont fucking say next pack. Or im too stressed. Just do it. Ive been off them for two years now :) just say no. Put them down. And dont go back."Moved in with my grandma after college to take care of her (and also needed a place to live). She had emphysema and had to be attached to an oxygen hose at all times. The oxygen hose had a 60 foot reach and was constantly being fed from a machine in the central dining room. She was one hell of a tough woman, but still couldn't do too much as she was still very limited to what she could muster before getting winded. That was the best way I quit smoking. Too bad I took it up again.""After smoking for ten years, I quit cold turkey using Easy Way by Allan Carr. It really broke through to me and made me realize that smoking didn't relieve my stress it caused it. "Smoking more pot."Chewing tobacco. It absolutely disgusts me, but it gave me relief from the cig urge. It was super easy to give up because it grossed me out so bad."I used to swallow the tobacco when I was done is that good?"It's been 3 years for me. My main trick was chocolate. 

More than anything it was fucking Toblerone bars.  You need to replace the nicotine craving with something else you love. You get that sugar rush, and it is crunchy and chewy too. And it is something that can feel like it's a little bit of a vice too. 

It's ridiculous that at a health care job you only get a break if you're giving yourself cancer! If I were you I would tell them you're going for a smoke break, excuse yourself, and then go eat a chocolate bar. You'll gain a couple pounds but it'll be worth it in the long run. 

Another thing I can say is to cut down before you go cold turkey. Get it down to one or two cigs a day, then only half a cig, then just a couple drags. 

Then, when you finally do cut out that last one, here is my other piece of advice that I wish someone had told me: It gets better after a month. I'm sure it varies based on how heavy a smoker you are, but for me, after exactly a month, it stopped being the only thing on my mind. I noticed that the constant cravings stopped. "Not smoking. I got a cold and didn't leave the house for 2-3 days and didn't smoke a cig that entire time so I decided to see how long it would go. Hardest part was getting in my car and not lighting one up or after having a few drinks the want for a cig was greater. It's been a little over a year now and I still get cravings every once in a while "You need a reason to counteract the moment to moment decision to stop. For me it is my girlfriend, others kids. Some people make something up or make a deal with themselves or someone else like, if I smoke a cigarette, I have to go to a shopping mall with a hitler mustache on for 1 hr."Probably not a great solution but I got a vaporizer and it helped me ween off of smoking. "Cold Turkey worked for me. After trying everything under the sun, one day I put a cigarette out 3/4 of the way done. I wrote the date on the butt and walked away. That was 14 years ago. I was smoking 2 packs a day at the time. I had nightmares for close to 5 years after I quit. I would dream I had started smoking again and I was so mad at myself. I've long since lost any temptation to smoke but I know if I ever start again, I'll likely die a smoker. That's enough reason for me to stay clear. "This probably won't be very helpful to you but what stopped me was getting angry with rising prices.  I finally decided I had better uses for that money and quit cold turkey. "Replace smoking with another habit. Like alcoholism or over eating! 

But seriously, try chewing gum. Im a medic and I work with a lot of old retired military and cop types, chewing gum worked like a charm for one of the old fucks, now he chews like 2 packs of cinnamon trident a day. ""Collect all your cigarette butts, wet them and put them in a ziplock bag. After a week open the bag and take a whiff. You'll never wanna see a cig a again. Had a few friends quit that way""My boyfriend said he'd break up with me if I started smoking again. I don't think he would but i get how important is to him and I respect that. I had gone 3 months without them when we met. 

Also ask your doctor about Welbutril/Bupropion. It inhibits the acetocholine receptors in your brain, so even if you smoked, you wouldn't feel the calming effect. Eventually you just stop trying and develop some sort of other oral fixation. ""I am currently enlisted with the military. During the time I started smoking, I was not generally affected by it since I was training rigorously everyday. Since I left school and had my own time and PT was a personal accountability; smoking became a habit that slowly started eating me up. I began slowing down on my run time from 10 minute mile and a half to 14 minutes. That's when I realized that it's affecting more than just myself, it's also affecting my whole career. That's when I had to stop, but I used e cigs and it helped me for a bit.

Also a girlfriend bitching at me to quit aided in my success. 


""My son being born was more than enough for me to say, fuck this cancer shit, I want to live to watch him grow up. ""This is gonna be buried, but whatever. I quit cold turkey 8 years ago, it was my millionth quit attempt, but only my 2nd serious quit attempt (my first lasted 28 days, when I decided I could have just one drag at a bar. Stupid).

My key to success was always having my iPod at hand. A physical craving lasts only two-three minutes, then it passes. When I would get a craving, I'd listen to a four-minute song. Make it through the song, and then back to what you're doing. YMMV, but this is what worked for me.""when i did my stint in the navy some fifteen years ago, i quickly learned the only way i was ever going to get any kind of break during the workday was to smoke with everyone else, and so i smoked lucky strike filter less; about a half pack a day everyday for four years. and the day i stopped smoking was the day i got my discharge, it was like a switch was flipped in my mind it was like ""well no reason for me to keep on smoking for breaks now"" I'm not sure why i was able to put down the habit so easily but i haven't smoked in ten years.""Quitting drinking. The two went hand in hand for me. Once I stopped the drinking, I had the willpower to stop smoking also.""I'm about 8 months off smoking. Not gonna lie, my massive trigger is when i drink and i've slipped up a few times, but i don't berate myself or give myself a hard time, i just start again. I kept slipping up when drinking so this year i have acknowledged that if i don't cut down/stop drinking, that i will most likely start again, so i haven't had a drink in a month so far.

One of the first times i quit, i would only let myself have a cigarette after a certain time of the day, and eventually i just kept making that time later and later until i only smoked on weekends.

Basically it doesn't matter what you do, just don't beat yourself up about slip ups and don't quit at quitting""I quit by making it difficult to smoke in the first place.  For example, I always smoked in my car, always. I started throwing my cigarettes into the back seat along with my lighter.  If I wanted to smoke, I had to hope for a red light and then search for them.  I eventually stopped altogether. 

I can't keep them in the car.  I have a pack in my nightstand from a while back, but I haven't touched them or felt the need to, so there's that.  I still avoid being in situations where I smoked a lot though, it just drives me nuts knowing I don't or can't smoke. "It's about being mentally prepared and truly wanting to quit. You have to commit to a lifestyle change and break the actual act/habit of smoking. What kept me going was meeting my now husband who is a nonsmoker. I just hit 4 years smoke free!You have to want to actually quit. The ecig saved my life. "Willpower, a need to quit, and a want to quit.  The need to quit isn't as important, but it helps.  I went cold turkey four weeks ago.  I haven't looked back.  I had the want to quit spending money for no good reason and was tired of having to leave hanging out with people to go have a smoke.  The final straw was finding out my wife was pregnant.  There is no way I'm raising my child in a smokers home.""It has to be cold turkey. To help with the cravings, the next time the urge arises to smoke, pantomime smoking a cigarette. Remember how it feels and smells to you. Then take deep breaths and imagine that you're actually feeling these things with each breath. I've been smoke free for four years now. As for your trigger, you may want to consider a transfer to another location."Started doing sports mor regularly and I felt the effects of smoking. Go out of the door run 10 miles and then realize how much pain it causes you just because your lungs aren't working full time.My girlfriend and I use to smoke until she told me she had asthma. At that moment I took our packs of cigarettes and said that's enough! We haven't had a cigarette since. :)"I wanted to be able to say ""I quit smoking when I turned 30.""  The only way to say this, without dishonesty, was to quit. After 14 years of smoking and several failed attempts to quit I knew it would require serious effort. So, I told EVERYONE I know that I was quitting and if they ever saw me smoking again it was because I had failed. I got my family of smokers on board and even got them to try quitting themselves, for a short time. Their support, along with the accountability of telling everyone helped a great deal. During the first 3 weeks I used nicotine patches to curb the worst of the cravings and regular check ins with my family and friends.  It's been 8 months and I have no desire whatsoever to smoke another cig. 
Also, thinking about the $16k I spent on cigarettes helped. 

Good Luck friend! 
"Failed dozens of times over decades.  That changed the day I started a journal and wrote in it every time I wanted a smoke.  I simply recorded how I felt during that urge.  The urges always passed and the journal entries became repetitive and educational.   Stopped taking notes a few weeks later and it has been 10 years without a smoke."There's so many good reasons to quit or let's rather say there's practically no good reason to smoke.
However, what helped me quit after being a chainsmoker for years was three things: 

- I fell in love with a girl who found smoking disgusting. (BUT I didn't really quit FOR HER because I knew that doesn't work... come the first quarrel would I have lit one up, I'm sure)

- I reeeeally wanted to quit. My whole youth I never had any money for ANYTHING because it all went into smokes. Even when I didn't have any money, my mom would lend it to me because she felt bad about having been a bad example (smoking all the time, everywhere in the house). 
Also, I woke up every morning and spat something the size of a hazelnut out of my throat into the sink and the whole taste and feel in my mouth every morning was just absolutely disgusting. 
Some more good reasons I didn't even think of or realize back then, for example, I didn't believe people when they told me my clothes or my skin were smelling of smoke. Today I can't even walk behind a person outside that has smoked minutes ago without smelling it O_O
So, yeah, you cannot quit if you don't really want to.

- And this one is a bit more practical: Don't try smoking a little less and a little less or shit like that, you need to realize that you've got one of the most addicting drugs in your system and you need to get that shit out! So, I would even say forget about nicotin patches or nicotin chewing gum (that stuff even made me extremely sick!), here's what helped me: Herb Cigarettes. No, I'm not talking weed or anything. It's just some kind of cigarettes that you can get in the pharmacy (at least in Germany) and ok, they smell like burnt leaves and you do feel that there's no nicotin in there, but that's the important part: Your addiction urges you to smoke a cigarette, and doing that eases that urge, mostly so even when there's no nicotin at all in it. So you can kind of cheat your addiction for some time until that shit is out of your system, which is about a week I guess (for me, it was actually the forth day that I felt something had changed in me). I'm not saying you won't have any withdrawal symptoms, but you can live through them and there is this one thing you can do to ease your urge to grab a cigarette: grab an herb cigarette. I only needed them for one week.

One more thing is very important because so many people manage to quit but then get back to it: You need to swear to yourself to never ever even take one drag from a cigarette. Don't ever get the stupid idea that when you're not addicted anymore you can have a smoke now and then with no problem. Your brain will always have ""scars"", ""changes"" made by that addiction and you are absolutely prone to fall back into that addiction. If you want to understand this (and many other interesting things about addictions, pleasure, depression, etc., I recommend the book ""Pleasure"" by David J. Linden).

Good luck :)

"After many attempts and different methods cold turkey is what worked for me... and having a very helpful and supportive girlfriend lol... havent smoked in abt 8 months... longest streak in 8 years"I smoked a pack a day for many years, an electronic cigarette worked so amazing for me, it's not easy but it's healthy alternative and I bought 1 pack over the course of the following year and haven't been buying cigs for 2 years now saved my life!""I had this year where my lung kept collapsing, god. so a few chest tubes later and a surgery weren't enough, apparently. but when faced with having a surgery to pull off my lung skin and roll a razorblade ball around the inside of my chest cavity so that the outside of my skinless lung would heal itself to the inside of my lacerated, with the razorblade ball, chest cavity, preventing the possibility of future collapses. buy what happens if I ever get in an accident where my lung gets punctured? what if I need heart surgery? these are issues that are created. so when faced with that, I was like fine. fine then, have it your way, see if I care. where did I put that champix prescription? this was years ago. but lately I've been rolling grape prime time in my joints. it's bad, but it's so good and they burn so much better. but it worries me and I should just cut it out before I'm hooked again, if I'm not already.""The first thing I did was admit to myself that I am an addict. That sounds obvious doesn't it? Well, to me, it wasn't obvious. Sure I know it was addiction to nicotine that made me want to keep smoking but I never considered that I was an addict. Perhaps it's because the idea of addict brings pictures into your mind of people with oily bad skin, horrible greasy hair, and unkempt clothes. 

However, admitting to myself that I am an addict was really a milestone and I then understood that, as an addict, I will always crave nicotine and I have to accept this fact in order to quit smoking. I think people who quit and start again simply fail to recognise this fact. You're an addict. Addicts always crave their vice. Sure, it waxed and wanes, but it never actually ever goes away. My uncle gave up 30 years ago and says he still gets a craving for a cigarette now and again. The difference is he is confident that craving will pass. No need to give in to it. It will subside and the rest of the world will distract you.

The other key was actually really wanting to give up. When I've tried in the past some part of me didn't actually want to stop. This time, however, my mindset was different. I fully acknowledged that smoking really has ZERO redeeming features. There is absolutely nothing about it that gives you any benefit whatsoever.

Some people claim it helps them cope with stress but I think that is BS. The only stress it relieves is addiction stress. Smoking really is like putting on tight shoes to feel the relief of taking them off (to borrow from Alan Carr).

So, to sum up.

1) I'm an addict and I have accepted that, and all that comes with it.
2) I really wanted to stop.

I'm now at two years and just under a month.

In that time I have smoked two cigarettes. One when I was very drunk. I didn't beat myself up about it. I just said ""OK, don't do that again. You're not back to square one. Just ignore it as a drunken slip"".

The other time I just felt like smoking a cigarette to see how it felt. This was about a month or so ago. It reminded me of precisely why I stopped. No need to remind myself again.

If you've just stopped smoking just remind yourself that you're an addict and treat yourself accordingly. It helped me for sure."I quit in 2007 before all this E-Cig hype.  I had good motivation but was still struggling to kick the habit.  I bought nicotine patches right before I was going out of town to visit relatives for a week.

By using willpower you are fighting the habit with your conscious mind, constantly trying to use your conscious mind to quit against your superior subconscious is a losing battle.

How to do this depends on the individual but what works for most people is to not think about it and distract your mind away by doing other things.""Cold turkey... more or less.

Smoked for over 25 years and my early years I smoked the most, eventually getting to a carton a week on Camel non filters at 14. Over time I changed cigarettes and frequency over the years and went from regulars to lights to ultra lights to menthol ultra lights, smoking less than a pack every few days at this point. Then one day I just hated the way they started to taste, something was missing from that toasty flavor I was use to all these years. It's been a couple of years since I smoked regularly, I've had one or two here and there and in fact I tried to have one a couple of weeks ago, took a few drags off of it and tossed it.

I do know for a large majority of the people that I know that smoke, they have gone to the e-cig (the e-go twist being the choice of preference) and for most part have quit smoking all together. However some have said they use the e-cig more frequently now.


""For me it was a slow process and every now and then I'll still have a smoke with friends while out at a bar etc. It's pretty rare though. I actually saw a commercial on TV about approaching quitting differently (I forget what website it was for). I really thought about that and considered what triggers would cause me to want to smoke. Slowly one by one I over came these different triggers. The big ones were driving to and from work, after eating a meal, and breaks at work or during long gaming sessions. I just tried to cut out one activity at a time. The first was driving, I had recently gotten a new car so it made that choice a lot easier because I didn't want that smell in my brand new vehicle. The biggest hurdle was the smoking while drinking alcohol. That one took me the longest and like I said, once in a blue moon I'll cheat. I quit without the aide of patches or nicotine gum as well. I just went a modified/slower version of cold turkey. It's been maybe a little over a year now without buying a pack of smokes. ""I broke little habits first. For me, smoking was very much tied to certain activities. I always lit a cigarette when I got in the car, after eating, after smoking weed, etc. So, first I quit smoking in my car, then I quit smoking right after meals , and so on. Gum. I chewed a lot of gum. Not the nicotine kind. 

Also, I had recently started dating someone who didn't smoke and he was very concerned about the impact on my health, so he encouraged me and helped me to quit. 

Also, attitude. Slipping and smoking one cigarette does not mean you failed and are a smoker again.  That mindset is setting yourself up for failure. Don't think you have to buy a whole pack or revert completely back to your old habits just because you slipped up once. You smoked, it happens, now go back to not smoking.""YMMV, but for me, a severe anxiety attack. I woke up the following day and the urge was just gone.""I counted the number of empty packs I had on the floor of my car. It was about $100 worth within a month. Being poor is a good reason to quit when you think about how much you're spending on cigs. Also, drinking is a trigger for me so not drinking saves me money on cigs as well as boose. ""I tried to quit many times before. I am a couple of years smoke free today. My trigger was the bars with friends. Everyone I know smokes when drinking. I used e-cig as a crutch, along with high intensity running/exercise. 

I can say honestly that I am no longer tempted, and the smell of smoke is unpleasant to me. Cigarette smoke, of course..""After smoking on and off for 16 years, quitting countless times and always going back what made me stop was the birth of my daughter. My last puff was 1-27-10.. the day before she was born. All I could think about was what it would be like if she had to grow up with out a father, and what her wedding would be like if I had died of cancer years before. I have not touched any tobacco since and I probable won't, until there is some kind of dooms day coming or zombie apocalypse. At that point... fuck it.""The electronic cigarettes coupled with nicotine mints helped me stop after 12 years of smoking.

The mints are so vile, they made me feel ill, but they did stop the overall craving for a small while (few hours). The electronic cigarette helped with the habbit and sucking on something (insert joke) as well as the nicotine.

I started on 36mg of nicotine in the e-cig, after a couple of months, went down to 24, then 16, then mixed 8mg with 16mg, then down to 8. Then started mixing 0 with 8. And finally down to 0mg.

I stopped using the mints when I was on 16mg, because I had got so used to the e-cigs and I literally forced myself to stop with tobacco.

I still was using (and still am socially) 0mg e-cig liquid. But I've been smoke free for over a year now.

Here's the thing though... no matter what people tell you... there is *nothing* out there that will magically make you stop.

You absolutely have to force yourself to stop smoking while you are trying to quit. 

In my case it helped because I had no money at the time, and literally couldn't afford tobacco. So not having any in the house, and not being around smokers really helped.

Yeah I got cravings, and yeah... I still do! But it's a lot easier to manage now.

You'll still get cravings after you stop, but you will find that once you no longer become dependent, you can easily just turn away from it.

But what most people have to remember is that as I wrote, there is no magical cure available to people. (apart from another addiction).

You have to want to stop... and by wanting, you have to force yourself to go through a lot of shit, feel like shit, act like shit, and you will treat other people like shit while you are giving up. It's simple withdrawal.

But remember you are doing it for a better cause.

After quitting myself, I have encouraged a few others to use E-Cigs. 2 of which have also quit smoking now thanks to them. (One of them smoked cigars for decades). 

Just don't give up on them. The E-Cigs really do help. Just make sure you get a good one, with high amount of nicotine value at first (for that throat hit). And gradually work down when you feel comfortable.

If you feel that lower nicotine value is not helping, then mix the lower value with higher value ones. Until eventually you get to 0.

It can take months (took me around 8 months in total to get to 0mg) even years, but force yourself to not buy any tobacco.

*edit* will also add that having someone there to support you is a massive benefit. In my case, my wife helped me stop. She put up with the almost childish behaviour from me during my withdrawal periods... I ended up drinking more (luckily I'm just a forgetful person when I'm drinking) but she understood everything and knew it was for the best""I went inpatient for a four level spinal fusion last March. I was told beforehand that I should stop smoking as it would aid in the fusing. I am now working towards a year smoke free. 

So, in the end, for me, it took massive amounts of time released morphine combined with percocets, muscle relaxers, and nerve suppression pills.""The Buddy system, and by that I mean all my friends that smoke wanted to quit to, its a lot easier cause you have some support, and since they are quitting you won't be around other smokers while you try to quit""I vaped. Still do, but I don't need to. The method of quitting doesn't matter. It's the mindset involved. You have to want to quit. You have to tell yourself that you're no longer a smoker. Don't buy them, don't bum them, don't light any up, don't even think about them. It's that simple. ""I had tried 3 times somewhat (or not) successfully with the patches. Each time I resumed smoking 2-4 months after I had ""quit"". On the 4th attempt, I was only a week into using the strongest patch, and I got deathly ill with the flu. I had the flu for 2 weeks after the first week with the patch totaling 3 weeks with no cigs. I used the smaller patch on and off for a week or so, but I already knew it was over. Somehow the flu helped me quit smoking. "Smoked for 14 years. I started quitting with an electronic cigarette. Finally said I've had it and put off real cigarettes altogether in June of 2012. The biggest push to quit was the fact that I bought a mountainbike. Go out and ride. I used the E-cig as an emergency but slowly eliminated that as well. Nicotine free entirely since about July of '12. Ripping through the trails makes you not want a cigarette. "Quit a couple years ago, and I had to finally try to quit cold turkey because it just wasn't working any other way. I tried weening myself off and that just ended up going from trying to smoke a few a day to right back to the usual. So one day I just quit, started chewing a lot of sugar free gum and wanted to scratch my own eyes out for a few weeks but after that it was a lot easier. After a few months the cravings were gone. It's just one of those things were you have to force yourself to suffer for a bit and get through that initial rough patch, and it does get easier after that."I stopped buying them. Worked well for me.Getting acute pneumonia twice in a month. When you can't breathe and your job involves manuel labor and travel you're in a hell.

I know it wasn't right of her employer, but I'm happy she finally stopped.""I personally just went cold Turkey, boom stopped. 
The hardest part is actually just not to buy them anymore for me anyway, if you can convince yourself to not buy any then it gets easier. ""I quit a few thousand times before it stuck, it has been six years now.  For me the big thing was to get out of my milieu.  I was lucky enough to have a four week period where I was traveling. Smoking was part of all my habits, smoke first thing in the morning in the same place, after every meal day in day out.  Being out of that routine helped me initially and then I just kinda kept on.  I also quit drinking for a few years because I associated it so strongly with smoking.

Now I don't smoke or drink, and I have no idea what to do with my hands in social situations.  ""I was smoking for 14 years when my wife and I decided to try electronic cigarettes. After my last pack of smokes I started using the Ecigarette. Using it while driving and after meals was the main step.

You will smoke less. Don't buy more cigarettes. It will take a week before your urges go away. Also, don't drink. A couple beers puts me in the mood for a smoke. A couple more beers makes me carelessly ambitious enough to buy some.""My uncle quit cold turkey the day after Thanksgiving.  He was new to the family and we forgot he smoked.  One moment during Thanksgiving dinner included my sisters and I (all in our 20's) discussing how disgusting and horrible frequent smoking is.  He told us two years later that our statements caused him to quit.
In other words, people are able to quit smoking when they feel shitty enough about smoking to do so.""This is gonna sound stupid but honestly, discipline and willpower. The believe that I can do what I say isn't enough, its actively choosing to follow through with that decision that's key. You feel like a smoke? NO! I've made my decision I'm not going, NO. Just kept telling myself that until the cravings passed. For me it was 3 day, 2 week and one month humps where the intervals of cravings really started to decrease. The first 3 days was rough. Up to two weeks it was a lot less but still there. That last stretch to the month mark was more like, well shit i feel a lot better health wise maybe i can have one type pressure less so than actual cravings but again, willpower and discipline.""I tried to quit five or six times with varying success. A year ago (Feb 1) I gave myself one calendar year to get completely nicotine free. If I failed I said I'd kill myself. 

Since I don't want to die I immediately got serious about it. For a couple months I was doing the lozenges and smoking a couple times a week. That became more like a few times a day. 

That was basically where I was until November minus the lozenges. At about that point I kept thinking about the deadline at set. While I probably wouldn't kill myself it kept messing with my mind. Around Thanksgiving, one day I just woke up and said 'that's it, if I don't want a kill myself today is the day.'

Since then I've been smoke free even though most my friends and live in girlfriend continue to smoke. Also, I said if I smoke after the deadline years down the road the consequences would still be the same.

Head over to /r/electronic_cigarette for lots of info.""I should mention that my longest lasting quit attempt was by quitting cold turkey on a thanksgiving (It's true!). Was smoke free for four years. Then started again for a couple years, had a string of unsuccessful quit attempts, then found e-cigs. Good enough for me. "Honestly I stopped wanting to smoke the day I started celexa. Just tastes terrible while you're on the meds."After many (7 or 8) failed attempts...

Finally quit 6th attempt. I quit going to bars. I used nicotine lozenges. I also kept daily track of how much money I would've spent.

I had been wanting to quit for some time and decided to take a negative (the flu) and turn it into a positive. It was very hard for me for about a month or so, then I had a revelation. For the longest time I had considered smoking as part of my identity. In my mind, when someone saw me they thought, ""Hey, there's therealmnviking, and he's a smoker."" When I finally realized that I wasn't my cigarettes, it got alot easier to say no.

I moved back home to save some money and knew that if I moved back smoking it would be an every day argument with my parents about it (as they don't smoke and are very against it). It was just something I couldn't justify anymore and I wasn't as stressed so it was easier to not smoke. I personally used the nicotine spray and consistently tried to go as long as I could without it until I didn't need it anymore. I tried e-cigs but found that when I ran out of juice I was right back to smoking. I'm 8 months out now and relieved that that part of me is over. 

tl;dr - timing is key, used nicotine spray ""I stopped going to places where I usually smoke. I'd also spent my cigarette money on something ells like gum or pop. I had an e-cig for a while and it worked, but then I lost it and went right back to the cancer sticks.

Also try drinking energy drinks instead of smoking. That's how I quit.""I broke up with a girlfriend and 5 days later I realised that I had run out of tobacco days before. I'd been smoking heavily for about seven years before that, and tried seriously to quit at least twice. That was three years ago.

Fuck that. "I took Chantix and that helped me quit after 15 years.  Be very careful on the stuff though, your dreams will become insane and you'll temporarily become an asshole.  But hey... no more smoking right?""I tried at least 4 times, some attempts lasted more than 2 years and now 2 months clean. What worked for me is a mix of nicotine chewing gum and salmiak lollipops. The lollipops functions as a fake cigarette for the hand movement to and from the mouth.

First, I start breaking the sequence of smoking. I smoke cigarettes with a higher nicotine level than I am used to, but at the same time less cigarettes. 

After that I chewed gum with 2 mg of nicotine and an occasional cigarette. Later I changed, at the same sequence, to 1 mg gums combined with lollipops.  

After a few weeks I just quit eating the gum and had no troubles doing without nicotine. Like that I broke the rythm, got used to less nicotine and in the end the chewing gum gets so annoying I just stop using it. When I want a cigarette now, I use a non nicotine e-smoker or a lollipop. "Champix"Chantix. Helped SO MUCH! In a day or two, cigarettes tasted like death and taxes. ""I went out of town for three weeks to work a job where I couldn't smoke. The disruption to my routine gave me the perfect situation to quit. It helped to come back home a non smoker with three weeks success. I still had to ride my ass like a drill instructor and 'reprogram' my brain when I got back. My experience is that you have to quit ALL forms of nicotine, even one bummed cigarette is one too many.""26 before 26. I have a set deadline for myself to run a marathon.

Plus, I was only twenty at the time and had only been a pack-a-day smoker for two or three years. I realized it would be much easier to quit then, rather than five years later when the addiction would be much stronger.""I quit cold turkey two years ago.

I smoked for 18 years, 1-2 packs a day. Loved smoking, it fit my lifestyle and habits really well, didn't have any especial reason to quit.

What happened was, I was staring down at my 35th birthday and frankly didn't want to become one of those old smokers with frog voices and a fusty aura. Also, smoking had stopped being fun and was simply another necessity. For example, my mouth tasted like an ashtray in the morning and smoking first thing was the only thing that made it okay. I was smoking because I had to not because it was fun.

So, I decided to try and quit. Took no advice, did no research, changed no behaviors right away. What I did was:

(1) Instead of smoking whole cigarettes, whenever I smoked I smoked half a cigarette (you can save the other half even and smoke that later). 

and, at the same time,

(2) whenever I wanted a cigarette I would delay lighting up briefly. I started with a 2 minute delay, found that easy and moved right up to a 5 minute delay, then after a week or 2, to a 10 minute delay and so forth. By the end I was smoking half a cigarette once a week (I really looked forward to it for awhile, too). Once I got to 2 weeks I just said fuck it and stopped altogether.

What I found was, gradually, the less I smoked the more unpleasant an experience smoking became until I really didnt want to do it anymore. Never wanted to start again, either. 

The trick was not to push my self-control any further (farther?) than I wanted to at any given point. So if I really wanted a cigarette, I would smoke half a one; if I still wanted more, I would wait however long until I smoked another half, etc. Even when I first started this and during times of supreme stress, I found it easy to wait 2 minutes to light up. Once that habit kicked in, it just got easier and easier not to bother. I gradually developed other habits (like walking around while I waited   for a cigarette, for example) that displaced smoking. I always smoked in lieu of being physically active (I hate sitting still but my family used to hate me fidgeting and running around all the time, plus I had to sit still to work), so since I quit I've become quite the devoted athlete. Exercise endorphins do for me now what nicotine did when I was younger.

At least try this out if you can because it totally worked for me, did not interfere with my life or my good disposition and to be honest, I barely even thought about it. I just started with the the half cigarettes, then added in the 2 minute delay and never honestly spent much time thinking about it. I started in February and stopped in time for my 35th birthday at the end of July. I think I got down to half a pack really fast but then hung out for a while at 1 cigarette morning, noon and night for a while and then at every other day and then at every 2 days, then twice a week for quite awhile. I reallly looked forward to those cigarettes, and even the once a weeker (Sunday after brunch), for a long time, so it was worth not trying to go cold turkey too quickly.

Best of luck, and remember that every half cigarette you don't smoke right away immediately benefits your health, your wallet and your escape from nicotine. Eventually you really will quit and you wont feel like you're missing out on anything.
"Fap each time you want to smoke one.When my father learned my mother was pregnant with me he quit immediatly. Cold turkey."I quit for 10 years by developing my own 2 month program.

First, I identified triggers. Finishing a meal, watching tv/movies, playing video games, talking on the phone, stress, driving--I associated all these things with smoking. For 30 days, I could smoke, but I could *only* smoke. Meaning, I went to my kitchen, lit a cigarette, and smoked. No books, no radio, no tv, no phone, no texting, no other people, no outside stimulus. I was *just* smoking. I also did not smoke within 20 minutes of any of my trigger activities.

The night before my quit date, I threw out all my ashtrays, lighters, remaining cigarettes, and cleaned my entire house. I also washed my clothes.

For two weeks I did the patch. When the urge to smoke would come over me, I would use the 4D technique--delay, do something else, drink water, deep breathe.

Then I dumped the patch. 2 weeks later I was a free woman.

I did start again, 10 years later, during a suicide attempt. Two years later I'm still smoking. I intend to use the same plan I used before.""How I quit:

1. Don't smoke for as long as possible (I was a pack a day smoker and I made it almost two weeks without a cigarette)
- Get really stressed at work
- Bum American Spirit cigarette from coworker (has to be AS, since they take longer to smoke)
- Smoke entire cigarette down to butt as fast as you can
- Spend several hours at your desk choking back vomit and drenched in cold sweat
- Now I can't even smell cigarettes without feeling vaguely nauseous.
- ???
- Profit.

Quit a 12 year pack a day habit over two years ago. Last cigarette I smoked was in July when a friend committed suicide, and it made me feel so ill that I can honestly say I'll never touch one again. I also smoke a metric shit ton of weed, which probably helped me quit cigs.""I started going out with a girl that I was absolutely crazy about and she didn't smoke so I instantly dropped the habit cold turkey so I didn't have to subject her to the smell or the smoke

When you have something like that to strive for I find it makes it significantly easier.""Chantix.  I knew I needed to quit for health reasons a girl I was dating at the time was bothered by it. I tired patch, gum etc but usually only lasted a few days.  Took about 2 months dosage of Chantix versus the 3 months but was able to quit within 1 week of starting. And justified the high cost since it was close to the carton a week I was smoking. ""My father was in the hospital multiple times and has serious health problems to this day, that honestly was enough motivation for me to quit. I quit cold turkey and it honestly isn't so bad after the first week.""Every time I had a craving I just ate fruit instead, an apple or orange and I drank lots of water and worked out in the gym, I had a small gym where I worked during my breaks I would go in there I would walk on a treadmill some light workout stuff, if not the gym I would just take a walk outside around the building. I kicked the habit quickly replaced the smoking part with something to eat that was healthy something with some fiber to make you feel a little satisfied, train your brain to do something else in place of the smoking, the nicotine withdrawal only lasted like 2 days max, that dizzy feeling after that it was just a matter of replacing the habit with something good and healthy slamming it with excersize and water and fruit or veggie. The trick to kick it for good with me was to do all these things and not hang out with the folks that were smoking until about 2 weeks  in and then I was able to go outside smell it and not feel like I needed it. I'm sure some people can just kick a habit like that simply by doing it, but I had to retrain my brain and do something totally different in place of it. every time I felt like I need a cigarette I would drink even more water and eat an extra apple, to get that full feeling or some kind of satisfaction going, that's the part you have to really focus on doing and stick with it.""You just gotta grow a set and stop. Don't look for excuses they're for pussies. If you want to quit, and you should, then quit. I smoked a pack a day for 5 years and then I just stopped, because I grew up and realized it was stupid.""I stopped smoking in my car first and would only smoke before or after the ride. Then I stopped smoking at my home and then the only place I smoked was work. I just stopped going outside and decided to have chips and a soda in the break room. I haven't smoked in 1 and a half years.... I've gained 15 pounds, but I haven't smoked! Lol""I'd try a different kind of ecigarette. I had a couple generic starter kits of blu, and others, but the real deals are the ones you can basically create your own and make clouds of vapor! Not to mention there is a HUGE variety of flavor, even pretty good tobacco flavors. Thanks to /r/electronic_cigarette, I was able to kick the habit within a few months. ""My one year anniversary is at the end of February and I have zero urges. I used an ecig but I bought the expensive type that you have to fill. I also joined a gym. Working out and exercising helped get the nicotine out of my system quickly and I became addicted to being fit. I now appreciate breathing which I didn't really do as a pack a day smoker. I am amazed how nice it is to walk through the world and not be winded. 
As a recovering drinker must go one day at a time recovering smokers must exist second by second. When you are hit with an urge to light up sit back, breath. That second will pass and so will the urge. You can do this! You got this!!!"Got diagnosed with a hernia at a young age (23'ish) - made me realize how important my health was.  Threw out my pack of smokes in the parking lot on my way to my doctors appointment and never smoked again (23 years ago)."I quit when my 14 year old step daughter moved in and started stealing my smokes.

His 34th birthday was on Sunday, so I said how about for your birthday we quit and make this pack our last? He agreed, so we did. But his birthday wasn't the only motivator. We're living paycheck to paycheck putting our kids through private school because our towns school district is falling apart. I got sick of checking our credit card statements to find which ones aren't maxed out so that we could buy a pack of smokes. $7 bucks a day...that's over $200 a month, and we're living paycheck to paycheck? What a ridiculous decision to decide NOT to quit. Also we hid smoking from our kids so it was getting tiring to sneak a cigeratte outside while they were occupied and then make sure they couldnt smell it on us after. Its been hard, I still think of smoking daily, and I can't say that my husbands birthday was great as we were both withdrawling. But I know that future birthdays will be better because of it. Best of luck to you! If you weigh the options and keep reminding yourself why you're quitting, you will get through it.""Medical student here. No one can tell you to stop smoking. I smoked for 5 years and randomly quit one day, cold turkey. That's the only way.""Willpower, mostly, although I was never a heavy smoker. For about 15 years, a pack would usually last me three or four days, and rarely did I smoke a pack in fewer than three days. During a bout with Rocky Mountain spotted fever in 1982, I was laid up for the better part of a month. During that time, I did not smoke, did not even want a cigarette. When I recovered, I decided I might as well quit. There were a few antsy moments, but I did it. Haven't smoked since. Are cigarettes habit-forming? Yes. Are they addictive? Not in my case. Basically, I think you have to want to quit more than you want to smoke. It's not easy, but it can be done.""I used a one hitter and marijuana. Everytime I wanted a cigarette I just hit the one hitter. I have not smoked since. Nicotine is a hell of a drug, use any crutch you can to quit them. Good luck! Quitting was the hardest, and one of the best things I've every done.""Easy, I put a DICK in my mouth instead.""Don't give up!  I was a smoker for nearly 20 years and tried countless times to quit before finally quitting for good about 9 months ago.  Like most of us, I tried everything including the e-smoke but all of those eventually led me back to smoking because they were just similar replacements to smoking and smoking to me was always the better high.  Some lasted longer than others but eventually I always gave in and started smoking again.  People in this thread keep saying it but if you haven't ""just stopped smoking"" then you don't understand that it has to be a perception shift from smoker to non-smoker that will be the determining factor, most likely.  What worked and still works for me is to really be mind-full of a few things (listed below).  At first I removed as much temptation as possible, no drinking, no coffee, nothing that went hand in hand with smoking.  I didn't hang out with my smoker friends and didn't go anywhere that made me want to smoke.  I can now have a beer, drink coffee, go to bars and coffee shops, hang out with smokers etc. but I still get the urge every now and again.  It helps to have a great reason but it's not necessary.  Its more important to understand that its going to be difficult and at times miserable but its only temporary and just resolve to not smoke.  Politely tell your brain to shut up because you are not going to give in no matter how badly the desire to smoke and that is that.

There is no such thing as ""will power"" so don't perceive yourself as week or lacking will power because nicotine is fucking up your brain and you haven't figured out how to change that just yet.  You can quit!

Remind yourself that you are in control and you don't WANT to smoke, not one drag, not one break, no reward smoke for a tough day.  If you cheat then you have to start all over again and that sucks.  I hear you saying ""but I do want to smoke"" and that's the problem.  Nope, wrong, that's just your brain trying to trick you, you are a non-smoker and you do not WANT to smoke so why would you puff on that goddamn thing.

Keep quitting until you are free of smoking.  You realize mid smoke that you want to quit, then, put that coffin nail down and quit.  Wake up from a bender with a pack in your pocket, throw those cancer sticks in the trash.  Out for a break and a co-worker hand you a smoke, tell that bastard you are a non-smoker even if you just smoked on your last break.

Replace the habit with something like deep breathing, working out, eating candy, anything that helps and doesn't contain nicotine.

It WILL get easier but beware that there are some milestones and being prepared for them is helpful.  First is detox that's the first 72 hours when you still have the chemical in your body.  Detox leads to physical withdrawal symptoms. The withdrawl symptoms can be serious and severe and can last for weeks after detox but they will pass.  Next is the quickly passing craving part of it, you get frequent cravings but can easily distract yourself and make them go away.  This can last for several weeks into months. You already deal with these cravings by having a smoke so just deal with them differently. Then is the less frequent but longer lasting cravings, don't worry they pass too but they can last all day or several days on end.  I made it to this point several times before and went back to smoking because I thought, fuck it, if I am going to crave smoking for the rest of my life Id rather smoke than be miserable. That, of course, is a trap and I can report I'm not miserable now and am glad I gave up smoking.  Then you have the ""why not"" phase where you say sure I can have a smoke while I'm camping because it sounds great and I already beat that whole addiction thing.  This is SOOOO important, don't ever fool yourself into thinking its okay to smoke ever again no matter the reason or circumstance or you will just have to start the whole process over again.

"Willpower."I used a e-cigarette for a little bit about four years ago. What caused me to quit was the realization that I wasn't actually enjoying smoking with the e-cigarette.  I went from perfectly cooked prime rib to an Arby's roast beef sandwich. Yeah, it stopped me from being hungry, but it didn't satisfy me in nearly the same way. The thought that I had resorted to the Arby's of smoking had disgusted me enough to quit smoking completely.""What helped me most after smoking 20 years was truly wanting to be a non smoker.

May sounds extreme but I found that I had so much invested in being a non smoker,  especially getting rid of the smell,  That I just couldn't fail. It does take will power.

First of all, my ex smoked a lot. More than anyone I had ever been close to. It was shocking to me. He HAD to smoke a cigarette more than once an hour. He was two years older than I and I realized that if I continued smoking that I would end up like him and it really grossed me out. We broke up and I decided I would stop smoking.

A few stressful events unrelated to the break up happened in my life afterwards which I unfortunately coped with by smoking. 

New Years Eve this year, I had quite a bit to drink and went outside to smoke a cigarette. I ended up slipping on some ice and hitting my face directly into some concrete. I broke my nose. I decided cigarettes and alcohol were the cause and that this was my wake up call to quit both.

About two weeks after that, I went to the doctor for a check up and he told me I needed emergency surgery the next morning because something had gone wrong with my nose. I freaked out. I had never had surgery before and have a prominent irrational fear of anything doctor related.  I bought a pack that night and smoked three cigarettes.

My surgery happened and I wasn't allowed to really get up and move much so I didn't smoke. Then one day I went over to my new boyfriend's house and the subject of smoking came up. I learned that everyone in his family smoked except for him and he absolutely despises it. I mentioned that I was an occasional smoker at this point and his younger brother was shocked that my boyfriend would date someone who smoked. Then my boyfriend replied in the most disgusted way, ""well she doesn't do it around me.."" and in that moment I decided I would never smoke again."My parents found out and grounded me.

Driving and got stuck in traffic, open the window and celery. 2 weeks of that and I was off. That was 7 years ago. ""I smoked consistently for two years plus and just successfully quit a month and a half ago after countless failed attempts. First essential characteristic is will power or motivation. I was tired of spending so much money on cigarettes I noticed it was taking a toll on my lungs and thus I became determined to quit. The second very important thing that helped me quit was starting to go to the gym everyday. I started focusing on eating healthier and working out. The next thing I did because I almost quit cold turkey was to smoke American spirit cigarettes. Now I didn't actually buy the pack ( never for any reason buy a new pack when you're quitting because you simply won't quit) I bummed an occasional one off of my friend. However this worked for me because I never really liked that brand ( and I hated menthols). So I smoked half a cigarette that I didn't like about twice a week. This helped me associate a negative experience with cigarettes. The next crucial step that actually pushed me over the top and made me quit was an e-cig. Now this wasn't an ordinary 20 dollar e-cig, it was a 250 dollar fully modded e-cig. The ones where you can change the flavor and blow huge clouds of smoke. This had 12 MG of nicotine (half that of a cigarette). You can buy a very nice e-cig for about 100 dollars and I just used it whenever I was hanging out with my friend. (Usually 5 times a week). I did that for 3 weeks and then stopped. Using the e-cig with nicotine then turned my addiction away from cigarettes and more focused on the nicotine from the e-cig. From there it's easy choose a flavor of the e-cig you don't like very much and use it. It will still give you the nicotine you need to quit but will help so you don't create a dependency on the e-cig. After that ditch the e-cig or get a flavor with no nicotine. (Keep it around though so whenever you get the craving hit the e-cig and viola no more cravings goodbye cigarettes and start a new chapter of your cigarette free life. Also I occasionally rolled my own cigarettes using American spirit rolling tobacco. (It doesn't help much with the cravings but it does a little). Also before I go there are different types of addictions to cigarettes. People can be addicted to smoking the cigarette, pulling it out and lighting it, or the act of smoking. I realized I wasn't addicted necessarily to the cigarette but I loved pulling one out after class or after a meal lighting up and just chilling out for five minutes. I enjoyed the act of smoking it more than the actual substance of it. Anyways stay determined it is a struggle even after you quit because you can easily go back to smoking. I hope this helps and I hope my comment gets seen since I didn't see much advice in the comments so far. Sorry for any errors in spelling I'm on my phone. I'll try to edit in a link the the e-cig vaporizer I'm talking about right after I submit this. Oh last piece of advice use people around you that you are close to for support. 
Here's a link to some information just from a question I found on yahoo answers. The e-cig vaporizers I'm talking about are complex and takes a bit of researching and learning along with a sharp mind. It's a hobby to a lot of people modding their vapes to hit better and blow bigger clouds. Anyways this guy gives some good information and hopefully this will open the door for you. All you have to do is walk in and explore.

It was never a question of ""do I want to quit."" It was the question of ""do I want to smoke"". Well, that day I realized that, no, I do not. And then, I was no longer a smoker.

All the cravings for cigarettes was no longer relevant, because I did not want to smoke any more.

I know this might not work for all of you, but that little change of view made all the difference for me."I quit using nicotine nose spray. It was actually a fun process."Man the fuck up and quit, power through the first 2 weeks and you're good"I got dropped on my head by a colleague...honestly."I think just willpower and quitting cold turkey (like others have said).

It's not easy ;) But as Obama-san says, the best things in life are worth the effort.""Alan Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking! It's a book that totally worked for me. Some of the shit in there is dumb, but it's a good way to start thinking differently about it. Also, spending lots of time in a place you wouldn't normally smoke (might be hard if you're working full time though)""I tried the simple e-cigs you can buy at a convenience store and they never had enough umph to get me off of cigarettes, but I really wanted to stop smoking, and continued to look around. Finally I bought an e-cig/ vapor unit available at a dedicated store/online store. It worked!! it gave me the nicotine that I wanted, and none of the other crap that smoking gives you. It has been 6 mos, and I've never needed a regular cigarette.  ""I'm not sure if my way would actually work to get anyone to quit since it was the perfect storm....

But I smoked for about ten years, cigarettes just went up to $11 in NYC, and my drum rolling tobacco went from $5 to $9. I also simultaneously had low grade pneumonia and joined a beer league hockey team. I played my first game and thought I was going to die, unable to catch my breath on the bench. That did it for me!

""Personally not one piece of negative evidence ever work, I was too stubborn ever to stop doing something I enjoyed, I finally had a breakthrough when my SO used that stubbornness against me, she bet me å£100 I couldn't last a full year without a cig, it's now been over 18 months and I'm lucky I quit when I did as it turns out I had already given myself COPD over the years and it seems my childhood asthma has come back too :-(""I've quit twice the first for 1 year, now I'm going on 8 years. 
I call it the security blanket smoke. 
Smoke your last pack down to one cigarette and just keep it. I would always panic then drive to the store in the middle of the night and buy smokes, but with the security blanket I would say well I could smoke, but I'm not gonna.  But above all else you have to want to quit, not for anyone else but for yourself. ""I found that having a pack around 'just in case' I wanted one actually helped me quit. I would tell myself I don't really need one, but they're there if I do. No pressure ""I got a nasty case of bronchitis.  Couldn't breathe well, let alone smoke.  When I got over the illness, I just never had the urge to smoke again.  Helped that my girlfriend at the time stopped as well.""I had always said that I would quit smoking when I turned 30. That came and went and I was still smoking. I had a young son I didn't want him to even see me smoking. I my parents smoking played a role in my habit. I tried using chantix, after just two days I could no longer focus on anything. I was out driving with my family. I ran a red light and then almost crashed into another car. At that point I had my wife get us home I stopped taking the pill.  Then I quit cold turkey and have not smoked in five years. ""Marijuana, I'd only been smoking cigarettes for about a year and a half. But never when i was getting high. Then one day I smoked a cigarette after I'd just smoked some weed, and it made me so sick, and ever since then, I couldn't tolerate cigarettes.""Maths. It was the day before my 36th birthday and a friend asked what age I started smoking. I answered 18 and she pointed out that if I smoked the next day (i.e. my birthday) I would be smoking for more than half my life. Haven't had one since that day.
Also got a really simple app on my phone that keeps track of how many I would have smoked since and how much it would have cost me. Whenever I was having moments of weakness I would look at that and  tell myself that I couldn't set that back to zero. 
I stopped smoking 2 years, 43 weeks, 2 days, 10 hours, 42 minutes and 29 seconds ago and would have smoked 15,502 cigarettes which would have cost me âÂ6224.39 (if the price of cigarettes hadn't gone up in the meantime""I've tried to quit approximately 10-15 times, and tries close to everything. Then, I decided to quit new year. I want to prove to myself that I can do this, and I'm very stubborn about it. Almost a month now!! I still smoke weed though, and I have no intention of quitting that."Also I freaked out when I started seeing black and grey in my spit. "I relized how much my life was ran by this device that was killing me.  Before I went some where I made sure I had enough cigarettes.  Before the end of the day, I made sure I had enought cigerattes to get me through the night and into the morning until I had time to get more cigarettes.  If I went somwhere for vacation I made sure to have double the amount of cigarettes incase I couldn't get any where I was going.  Then I did the math on how much I spend a year on cigarettes.  At this point i relized the cigarettes were running my life.  In order to quit I used chantix.  Smoked for 15 years.  Haven't smoked in over 3 years."Using Swedish snus.

I was just honest. Quit date was 2/26/13 Neva forget"A program called Smokenders. Sadly, it doesn't exist anymore, as far as I know, probably due to its cost.
Cost, however, was certainly one factor that helped people commit to making it work. In 1986 I paid $450 as a student, I believe.
It was a six-week program that had us quitting after four, plus two weeks of support. I remember the day I quit: I waited and waited for the discomfort and cravings to hit me and they never came. It was awesome.
The program worked by creating simple little rules around when you could smoke during those first four weeks, and under what circumstances. You could smoke as many cigarettes as you wanted as long as you accepted the limitations. Those rules effectively decimated your habits around smoking and redefined the act of smoking so that you no longer made the same associations. The program kicked ass for me and I am still a non-smoker.
If you could find a one-time Smokenders trainer on Craigslist or Kijiji you might be able to get them to help you.
""I quit cold turkey almost a year and found that having distractions, like the gym, and a reward system helped. Every month i went without smoking would get me a blu ray or something as a reward. I hope this helps. Dont give up or get disheartened it took me about 5 attempts aswell, getting a little further each time. ""Good post.

I am on my second attempt.

I am doing the nicotine patch. At 14 MG per day, and get the ones from Walmart and some tape to kinda hold em.

I do chew on some Altoids when I want some mental diversion.

Staying away from people who smoke. I've noticed I'm quite acute now to the smell. Also, I do burn some MJ on occasion, so maybe the thc, etc. helps.

As for a pack a day though, I'm done. I don't even do the ecigs. Just the patch to replace the nicotine, or slowly wean myself off.

Mind you I've been doing this for 6 months, but whatever crutch you need.""I remember being with my family on holiday and the guy who owned the cottage we were staying in saw me smoking a cigar. He then continues with how bad it is for me and said I'll show you how I quit, he took the cigar from me had 2 puffs then just swallowed it! Took a few chews as I'd just lit it up and straight down the hatch it went! We were a bit stumped but forcing yourself to swallow each cig every time has gotta be a major put off for sure! ""I had to stop hanging out with people who smoked. This is the only thing that has been successful for me. I also stopped drinking as much, as alcohol is always a tobacco trigger!"Definitely my vision ego e-cig kit. Not a single cig since the new year. Best purchase of my life. I put the fuckin cigarettes down."At age 35, after several unsuccessful attempts, I met a woman who said she was interested, but could never date a smoker.  What finally ended up working for me was a combination of events.  I went on the patch on the first day of a week long vacation.  The change of surroundings and people gave me a nice head start.  It also helped that I was with this same woman on that vacation.  By the time we got back, I was 7 days into quitting and we were dating.  After that, I just didn't want to screw up the relationship and I still don't.  I am 7 1/2 years removed from being a smoker.  BTW, I married that woman.""easy, started chewing grizzly

I was diagnosed with Raynaud's disease, and my doctor told me that I might end up having to have parts of my fingers or toes cut off, if I continued smoking. 

I never even bothered to research it; but I have not smoked a cigarette since I left the doctor's office that day (3/5/2011)""I read a book that unbrainwashed me from thinking that smoking is actually a hard thing to do when in reality it's very easy.  I read Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking.

went from a pack a day smoker for 10 years to non smoker in about 3 days (time it took to read the book).""It's a bit morbid, but: every time I smoked, I imagined myself lying in a hospital bed, looking up at my family while knowing I was about to die. I would force myself to think about this every time, until eventually I was unable to smoke without thinking about it because I had created such a strong association. It turned smoking into an incredibly unpleasant experience for me, so soon quitting became very easy.""Im late to the party... but the answer is actually *wanting* to quit smoking. I knew it was time so I just stopped. I started working out almost every day ig i ever felt like i wanted one, I'd chew on ice. After week one, I just didnt care about them anymore. ""Not a smoker, but my dad was. He was able to quit because he didn't want to kiss my mom until he was completely smoke-free. It wasn't easy, not that I remember because it was obviously before they were married or had any kids, but that's what they both tell me. He hasn't smoked since.""I smoke for 4 years and I always thought i could stops whenever i wanted but i just didn't want to. Eventually i was sick of my fingers and clothes smelling like cigarets and everyone wanted me to quit smoking so i bought a shit ton of cigarets and smoked like 29 in one sitting i got super sick and threw up and felt like some shit,(side note i took the greatest dump of my life), anyway after that I was able to not smoke anymore. Having friends that are smokers makes it so much harder so you might want to not see them for a good week or two. "Both parents passed away in their 60's from heart attacks related to heart disease from smoking. I smoked since high school and since had gotten older and had a family of my own. I wouldn't smoke in the same room/car with my family around. Decide it was time to quit before it has done major damage (if not already). I'm fortunate enough to have great health insurance and went to my doctor and went on Chantix. Within 4 weeks I quit smoking. I stayed on the meds for three months. I would still have a small crave once in a blue moon especially if I was having a drink with some friends. Almost four years tobacco free and I never even think of them at all and I am so happy to have that habit removed. Didn't have any crazy side effects from Chantix that you here about. You hear about nightmares and stuff but the only thing had was more vivid dreams. Like dreaming in TechnoColor with better recall of the dream. No more standing outside in the freezing cold to smoke. No more stairs from people when you do stand outside to smoke. If you have any questions don't hesitant to ask and good luck. "I just stopped, yea I crave one but never do.  Clean since 2004.

I timed it when i had a cold, as i didnt wanna smoke for  week at that time anyway

I also started cycling to work, and I knew if i started on the fags again i'd lose my lung capacity gains""I tried to quit for thirteen years. Like andrewse, my kids were getting old enough to notice. What finally worked was making a deal with a co-worker: I helped myself to his cigarettes whenever I wanted one, and on Fridays I bought him a pack or two, making sure that I was buying more than I had taken from him. Almost immediately I went down to about half of what I was smoking when they were in my pocket, and when I got down to four or five a day I was able to give them up.""Cold turkey for me, bought a pack of Newports, pull one cigarette out, light it up and threw away the pack and lighter. That was 9 years ago.
""First semester of college, I was so happy that I could smoke freely while not having to be paranoid about my parents knowing (they lived 3 hours away). So, I enjoyed that for awhile. Then, it started getting cold and I hated having to stand out in the cold just to have a cigarette. Money was also tight. I tried cold turkey, it was really bad for me and didn't work. So then I decided to put my cigs in my car (the parking lot is a good 2 or 3 block walk from my dorm, I know it's stupid) making me not want to walk all the way to my car to have one.

After that, I limited myself to 2 cigs a day. Then after awhile it lead to 1 cig a day to 3 a week and then 2 a week. After awhile, I could feel myself slowing losing the craving of having one and the motivation to walk all the way to my car just to smoke a cancer stick. It's been a little over a year now and yes, I have had 2 cigarettes since then but I'm no longer addicted to them. In fact, the first time I had one after I quit, tasted like I was eating an ashtray so I put it out. 

The thing I thought about the most was, ""you have only been doing this 2 years, you are still young so take the chance now"". I also have many family members that smoke and I saw how it has crippled them. I knew that I had to. Smoking is is equivalent to doing heroine so it is very difficult but once you  beat it, you feel like you could overcome anything. It's also very important to have patience with people trying to quit and to be very supportive of them. Some people just don't understand how hard it is. You become super moody, can't sleep, want to eat everything, always feel on edge, your nerves are crazy, your heart is beating super fast, and you mind is racing. Unfortunately, I had friends who were constantly nagging me about how bad it is for and weren't being very considerate on what I was going through. Yes, I know it's bad. Why, the hell do you think I'm trying to quit? I started smoking when I was severely depressed because it was the only thing that calmed me down. They didn't seem to understand that. 
""I walked into work one day smoking a cig and stated that it would be the last cigarette that I would ever smoke. It was. You just have to suck it up and beat it, imo. What you go through to beat the habit is just a blink of the eye in the smoker's lifetime.""A long time ago, when you could still smoke in bars in CO, I was out with my friend ( non-smoker) and his girlfriend (smoker).  Bottles of Micky's were on special.  My friends were drinking Micky's but I wasn't because you get in bar fights when you drink Micky's.  She was bumming cigarettes from me but started to feel guilty so she started bumming them from other guys at the bar.  This made my friend jealous.  So he started yelling at her about how he hated her smoking.  She started yelling back because she was drinking Micky's.  The fight escalated until he yells ""THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE KISSING YOU WHEN YOU SMOKE!!!!"" and he grabbed a cigarette butt out of the nearest ashtray and ate it.  Since they were both drinking Micky's this didn't end the fight but escalated it.  More yelling, he eats another cigarette butt, she storms out of the bar, he follows her and I'm left there trying to gather my sences and finish my fat tire.  She kept smoking but the next morning I couldn't look a my cigarettes with out picturing the ash on the lips of my friend.  I haven't smoked a cigarette since.

I actually did it just on a lark.  Also, I wanted anti-depressants from the doc.  But I did not want to go through the hassle of seeing a psych doc for my depression.  I know Wellbutrin is used for smoking cessation.  So I went to my doc and told him I want to quit but I want help in quitting.  So he put me on Wellbutrin and told me to get patches.  I am looking at 2 weeks of not smoking at this time.  And I will say, I am glad I am doing it.  I was amazed the last couple of days of how much my taste of things has improved.  I thought I would be mad at myself and pick up smoking again.  But to be honest, I am not really missing it that much.  I just hope this time sticks for good.""There is no need for something relevant to actually hapen to make you stop smoking. I just started doing sports with trying to quit and thats what pulled me outta it. It was a fucking shame to me what I have let my body become and then recognized how much I am missing out with the decision of smoking.
Everytime I was out of breath after running for bareley half an hour, everytime I couldn't move my body further even though I wanted to, I was pissed off. Like really pissed off. About myself.
It was not really sport by itself, but the realization that came with it. As a grown man I was unable to follow a path I was willing to go, only because of lack of control over my mind and with that, my body.
Smoking is amazing, all the good times, events and emotions that you connect with it and go through with it. It just FEELS amazing to smoke.

I realized its health hazards.Told my every girlfriend and ex-fiance that I was quitting smoking for their sake. Kept a packet of cigarette with me all the time to test my determination and at the end, didn't take a single cigarette out of it. The first week was terrible.

""Cold turkey. Rid yourself of all cigs, especially that damn e-cig. Take a sick day or 2 because you are going to feel sick but push through it. You are doing this for a better future, going back to that cig is a sign of weakness and you are hurting yourself for momentary happiness and destroying your opportunity long time fulfillment. Whenever you get good news, do you want to feel like you need to smoke a cig in order to feel happy? No! Don't make yourself a slave, your stronger than that! Cut off all your access to cigs, avoid people who smoke, avoid getting a whiff of it while you walk down the street. The longer you go without smoking the better you will feel and the less you should feel yourself needing one. Fighting a physical addiction is hard but it is like pulling off a band aid, best if it is done as soon as possible to allow for vital recovery.

After the physical withdrawal, which only lasts a couple of days, it's all mental.

But I have to say, just cold turkey stopping was hard, but it was easier than anything else I had tried. I did e-cigs and stuff like that, but it never worked because I wasn't ready. I kept going back to cigarettes because it was comfort, it was home. Once I just told myself NO, I just kept going. Sure it was really hard at first, especially driving since that's when I smoked the most. Just seeing someone else smoking in their car was hard. But I just kept saying NO. After a day, then a week, then a month, I celebrated every small victory with a treat of some kind and the small wins made me feel good, like I was winning what used to feel like an uphill battle but now felt like no big deal.

The only thing that changed the last time I quit is that I never smoked another cigarette. I made a conscious decision to cut the habit and changed my thinking to where cigarettes disgusted me and I couldn't fathom putting another disease laced drag into my lungs. 

To this day, even if I drink, I am mentally conditioned to hate cigarettes. You can't flounder, it's all or nothing. 

Surprisingly, all of my good friends quit after I did using my advice and have not gone back. 

Protip: Try quitting when you are sick or have bronchitis, helps to give you a buffer when you don't even really want to smoke. "" I used champix (aka chantix) as a bit of a boost for about four weeks, then went cold turkey. I would not recommend completing the full course of champix to be perfectly honest, because it made me violently ill nearly every time I ate something which is why I stopped taking it. 

 *However*, it did condition me into feeling disgusted each time I crammed a ciggie into my mouth because I wasn't being compelled by the nicotine hit. You notice a lot of things you normally put up with when that's out of the way (flavour, smell etc), and it made quitting cold turkey that much easier. 

 My last cigarette was on 5th October, 2011 and I was a pouch a week smoker by that point. ""This is how I did it, however I'm a borderline psychopath so I'm not sure if that helped me or not.

Go without a cigarette for 3 days and see where you are. After 3 days, you can have a cigarette whenever you want but you'll be smoking again.

The important thing I took away from this was that I was allowed a cigarette whenever I wanted, there was no prohibition taking place. A little bit of the brain responds negatively to being told that it's not allowed to do something, so take that out of the equation.

Ultimately **you** have to want you to stop smoking, not your friends or your relatives or anyone else, just you. Too many people try to quit when they actually, deep-down, don't want to and it just causes resentment at feeling pressured by those around them.""The day I left the Army, I bought my last pack of cigarettes, smoked exactly one cigarette from the pack, threw the pack in the trash, and got in my uHaul with my wife and drove back home. Haven't looked back since. 

The first three or four days were hard but I powered through.

Also I started really running again (aside from the army's required 2 mile run for PT tests.) Noticing my improvements on how well I was breathing during my runs really motivated me to continue not to smoke.

Giving up any addiction is both a physical and mental process. You have to want to stop, you have to be willing to deny cravings, and you have to be able to let yourself go thru withdrawal. "Traded it for another addiction. "Not buying new packs, and asking my friends to not bum one to me even if I was drunk.""Was going to have to pay $1,800 a year extra for my insurance. Used patches and gum and successfully quit. Thing is, if you don't actually want to quit you aren't going to. ""A clear idea of what I could do with all the money I saved (which was to be able to afford to live on my own)
A supportive partner to get me through the burning desire to smoke.
A recognition that you need to take baby steps. I remember the first day I was taking it hour by hour just willing myself to make it through the first hour, then the next and the next, then it became day by day then month by month etc.""I smoked roll ups for about 15 years. I quit 2 and a half years ago by using e-cigarettes. I gradually cut down the nicotine in the e liquid until I was on 0gs, then I became pregnant and stopped completely.

Also, I moved to a different country, where my favourite tobacco isn't sold, and away from my smoking friends. I didn't really enjoy it anymore, so I think that also helped.

I still crave a lovely roll up once in a while though.""This thread has blown up... but I hope you see this and it helps you. 

Go out for a night on the town. Buy a new pack of ciggies. Get mind crushingly hammered. Smoke most, if not all, of that pack in one night. 

For me, that much alcohol and smoking, over the course of a few hours, always gives me an awful, ""I think I might be dieing"" hangover. Which allows me a nice 2-3 day head start before I even think about smoking again. 

2-3 days without a smoke can be enough to get you over the initial hump of quitting. It was for me! Smoke free for a couple years :)

Good luck!""I smoked over a pack a day for over 25 years. I haven't smoked since July 1st, 2013.  I set the date ahead of time and planned on stopping on that day. I used an e-cig for about 3 months after that date and now no longer use them. So I guess this worked for me:

1. Set a date to stop.
2. Stop on that date.
3. Use an e-cig to help with insane cravings.
4. Do not do things that you know will challenge you- i.e., go to bar, drink beer, etc.
5. After a week it gets much much easier.
6. Don't allow your thoughts to tell you its ok to smoke. Just don't."Chantix.  Swear buy it.  Once you get past the unimaginable nightmares."A combination of patches (used diligently, relentlessly and correctly) and the fact that I was absolutely fucking sick and tired of feeling sick and tired all the time. "Willpower."I used Chantix. You smoke while taking it for the first week and after that first week cigarettes tasted gross and the cravings were gone. At that point I realized it was a simple decision. Smoke, or don't. I chose not too. I kept it that simple. On January 3rd, at 10:00am EST, it had been 3 years since my last cigarette. If you want it bad enough, you can do it.

Edit: Adding info. You're supposed to take it for 3 months but I only took it for 2. ""I could afford to buy a house or to smoke. Chose the house, quit cold turkey - previous attempts to wean myself off hadn't worked. I think you need an external focus to give you a reason, it can't just be a fuzzy ""because this is bad for me"" thing. Good luck!""The vaporizer with the liquid containing nicotine you fill up. The air you inhale is warmer than ecigs, so it's more satisfying. Also, I still sometimes go outside for a smoke session just to complete the ritual, but overall I dropped the cigarettes flat out and didn't feel like I just stopped heroin cold turkey... Plus, it tastes like strawberries and pineapple, and shit like that, instead of just fire and ass. Good luck, bro.""My dad, a smoker for nearly forty years, quit to lower his life insurance payments. ""It took a heart attack, helicopter flight and a $100,000 hospital bill before I quit, but I quit THAT DAY and have never had another."My husband told me he wouldn't marry me until I quit. I was smoke-free 2 months later. I just needed a reason bigger than myself to give my force of will a boost."I quit about a month ago, and I just did it cold turkey. My girlfriend and I decided we'd quit together. I kept with it, she didn't.""I do not wish my method on anyone, but it worked for me:

Smoked for six years (16-22), decided to try the patch. Felt amazing for the first hour, then wanted a cigarette again, but only a *little.* It was a Friday and I was in a shameful phase of my life I think of as College Blackout Drunk Quest, so I got blackout drunk that night, abstaining from smoking the whole time (at some previous point during College Blackout Drunk Quest I realized that if I didn't smoke, I wouldn't start feeling ill after a lot of alcohol). Woke up the next morning feeling pretty great; realized later that day that I had been still drunk that morning, and the most unholy of all hangovers set in.  Spent the rest of the day concentrating *extremely* hard on not vomiting, with nausea totally nullifying any desire for a cigarette or another patch.  Still felt pretty gross the following day, but it was just a few hours to the magical 48-hours mark, where (may or may not be true) the physical addiction to nicotine is basically over.  From then on, I kept reminding myself that I made it through the only real hard part, and the rest was all a simple test of willpower.  It's now ten years later, and I think smoking is disgusting.  I also don't get blackout drunk anymore, so that's good.  

I guess if there's a positive spin on this, it's that if you *happen* to get super hungover, maybe transition that into quitting. But please, don't aim to get blackout drunk in hopes of quitting smoking; listen to the other advice in this thread, it's way better.

**TL;DR: Replaced cigarettes with a night of binge drinking, hangover symptoms trumped nicotine withdrawal.**"Never giving up. My girlfriend says I'm getting quite good at quitting because I do it so much. I recently gave up again. I start on a Monday and wear Step 2 patch for one week and then Step 3 patch for one week. Will be four weeks on Monday. If you relapse just try again.."I was smoking 8-12 cigarettes a day for three years. Got a girlfriend, quit cold turkey because she didn't like it (for some reason it was just easy).  Dumped her, hung out with my friend and bummed cigs off him... instantly hooked on smoking again.  Tried quitting here and there, lasting a few days, a few weeks... but always going back.  I ended up getting a ""bug"" that was going around, which cause a really bad respiratory infection.  I was so sick that I didn't even want to smoke, and it lasted about a week.  After that week when I felt like smoking again, I just decided not to start back up.  So in a sense, I didn't quit... I just never started back up.  I don't know if being sick helped me make up my mind, or if it was the reverse psychology.  I did end up smoking while drinking at parties, but I eventually decided to end that because I witnessed a few autopsies and saw first hand what real smokers lungs look like.""My father has this story about eating gummy bears every time he craved a cigarette. Soon, he realised he ate million gummy bears a day, and it completely scared him out of smoking.""In my opinion, the biggest factor that one must have is the desire to quit.  If you think some pill or patch will do it for you all alone, your wrong.  I used to smoke 1/2 pack a day for over 16 years and finally got to the point that I REALLY WANTED to stop.  I was tired of the smokers cough, waking up with ashtray mouth every morning, scheduling my day around smoke breaks, and of course the cost (although it was no where near what it costs today).  But for me, the one that really got me moving was the thought of me sitting in a doctors office sometime in the future, being told I have some sort of cancer and KNOWING I could have prevented it if I had just quit.  

Once I was at this point, I simply used the patches and stuck with it.  Once you have the determination, the aides will work for you!"Make yesterday's last cigarette YOUR last cigarette. Making today's cigarette your last usually made me go back to smoking by habit multiple times."As far as the final motivation it took for me to ""want"" to quit: For me it was watching prices and my cost of living soar. I decided that almost ten bucks a day to do something that eats my life away wasn't worth it.

My actual tactic for quitting cigarettes for good: Each week I'd reduce my daily intake by 1-2 cigarettes. Eventually getting myself down to just 1-2 a day. Then it was 1 every other day. Finally I just stopped, threw the pack away (great feeling). My last cigarette was 2 years and 1 month ago. I have not cheated. I have not really wanted to cheat. Occasionally I think it'd be fun to have a drag or two, but it's just not worth it. Plus, the smell repulses me now that I can smell what I smelled like.

It took about 8 months of persistence to quit for good. But it was worth it. ""I tried loads of times... Patches, will power, gradual cutting down and even the Allen Carr Easy Way. Eventually it was a good reason: moved in with girlfriend and smoking would be half my social spend. Smoke vs beer, no contest for me""I came close to smoking a pack a day and I didn't want it to happen. So I gradually stopped. I distanced myself from people who smoke. Let them know you're trying to quit. They should understand. At work, I used to take cigarette breaks, so when I was trying to quit, I would just go to the bathroom instead and freshen up, re-touch my lipstick or something.

In the end it saved me A LOT of money. In NY that's $13 in my pocket every week.  ""OP PLZ READ - what if I told you you didn't have to give up your addiction to nicotine? I see you have ""the electronic cigarette"". Unfortunately what you are talking about is not a viable means of nicotine delivery to actual smokers. The reason for this, is that the way ""cigalikes"" deliver e liquid to the coil is very inefficient and flawed, not to mention they use terrible quality, and usually low nicotine e liquid. However, vaping in and of itself is a very good way of delivering nicotine. The problem lies with regular ""e-ciggs."" A very solid and reliable device that worked for me and works for everyone who tries it is the eGo-T. You can get a complete kit minus e liquid on ebay for $20, the way it works is much more efficient than regular e ciggs and if you find a nicotine strength you can work with you will simply not have the desire to smoke. There are other things in ciggs besides nicotine, and after a while if you smoke an analog you will just feel sick... you'll hate the taste, feeling, breath, smell... and than you'll pull out your ego t and be completely satisfied. It will feel ""cleaner"" and you will eventually not even imagine going back to tobacco. Trust me, what your addicted too is nicotine, not tobacco. Smoking tobacco has a very fast delivery rate, which is why some people will be addicted to ciggs over dip, snus, ect. The reason why vaping is so awesome is that you can be just as satisfied, only regular e ciggs don't really do anything. At least google ""eGo-T""

Edit - and check out r/electronic_cigarette""Ex smoker and fully recovered ex raging alcoholic here. The best way to quit anything is to find healthy substitutes when you get cravings. If you substitute the drug with another drug, then you will be dependent on another substance. I smoked a lot of pot when i quit cigarettes and alcohol. Sounds silly and a bit unhealthy, but it worked and I will live a long healthy life as a result. Don't have them around at all. If you can go 2 to 3 weeks, thats the hardest part. Be strong, it's only as difficult as you make it."I started working out. I got my head rush by lifting heavy weights."Wow. I just realized it was exactly 9 years ago today that I quit. 

Why I quit: My wife quit immediately when she found out she was pregnant. I decided I needed to as well both to support her and so that my new daughter wouldn't have to be exposed to second hand smoke. It helped a lot when I told her that I was quitting and she threw out an almost full pack and all my lighters. I was really mad about that, but she wa

How: #2 pencils and gum. 

Holding on to a pencil (I kept them about half size so they were the same form factor as a cigarette) all the time kept my hands busy with something to flick and bite. I hate the smell of smoke now and can't imagine even taking a puff of one, but to this day I still want to hold one every time I see someone smoking. It's a weird psychological thing, but I'm convinced that the pencils were the most important part. 

The gum was to give me an alternative to the actual smoke break. I would actually go take a little walk and chew a piece of gum every time I wanted to smoke. The psychological routine I had to take a ""cigarette break"" was the harder to quit than actually smoking a cigarette, so the gum & walk helped me by eliminating only the actual cigarettes instead of having to also quit an otherwise benign habit.

Good luck, it's worth it!"About a month after my birthday last year I realized I had been smoking for 10 years. That did it."For some reason I was able to quit cold turkey. It probably helped that I didn't smoke that much to begin with, I probably only went through a pack a weekend maybe? The main reason I quit though was because I really enjoyed smoking and drinking at the same time and where I live (IL) they banned smoking indoors so I really didn't enjoy smoking as much. 

Maybe try avoiding people/situations where you typically smoke and you might find yourself not reaching for a smoke? Obviously you can go back to whatever after you think you've kicked it, but it might help. ""I've seen a lot of comments saying, ""just decide to quit"" but I know it's not that easy. I've never smoked but my father did (he hasn't picked one up in 32 years). They way he says he quit is looking into the future and realizing what it held for him if he stayed on the path: constant wheezing, short of breath, and possible lung cancer. It really motivated him to just stop.
I've heard from others that finding a substitute addiction helps. One of my friends would work out every time he got the urge, and not only did he quit, but he got in great shape too.
Good luck!""Do you smoke next to your loved ones? Congratulations, you just shortened their life a bit.

This doesn't work?""Working at a cancer hospital.. Not overly pragmatic method, but it worked.  
"Nicotine gum helped me.  Though that was before this whole e-cig thing blew up.  If I was quitting now that's probably the way I'd go about it.  Good luck!  Chewing..Start chewing tobacco instead"There's a few things, most of them are psychological. 
1) The first thing you have to ask yourself is are you psychologically ready? Do you believe you CAN quit. Are you mature enough, are you ""man"" enough to bite the pain.

2) Don't make them easily available. If you have a regular cashier at where ever you buy them ask him to not sell you any in the future. Don't keep them in the house.

3) Find a replacement. This is going to sound weird but it actually worked for me - whenever you feel the urge, get up and grab yourself a glass of water. Often times just doing something when your anxious will get it off the forefront of your mind.

Good luck to you!  ""Not myself, but I heard a story of a serious smoker quitting cold turkey by making a promise to herself and a friend that if she smoked again she would donate $5,000 to the KKK. Every time she went to take a smoke, she would have these horrible mental images of the KKK and that would stop her. She never smoked again. You can listen to the story [here](http://www.radiolab.org/story/117291-you-v-you/) (It's a really good listen).

Essentially if you make something just as urgent that opposes your urge to smoke, (like horrible thoughts of the KKK (see previous)) instead of a less urgent thought (It's bad for my health). The urgent side always wins, so you make not smoking as urgent as smoking."willpower baby.  I said enough and gave it up.  over 7 years now. "Wanting to quit was big. Quiting was a big gift to my kids. I was stunned by their response. I quit that winter. Nicotene gum helped me a ton, Nicorette mint gum. I actually got addicted to it and had to quit it as well a few weeks later. But man was that easier than quitting smoking. Hardest thing I've ever done. My wife just quit, I pomised her a cat, I'm very alergic to cats. We have a cat now. :) I think it was harder for her to quit than me.

I've been quit almost eight years now.""This will get buried, but I will answer anyway. I started taking small doses of the drug fanapt for mild OCD and mild bipolar. As soon as I started taking it, the smoker part of my brain turned off. I've been 7 months without a cigarette, and I would estimate I've had maybe a dozen cravings. Curious stuff.

If you have the pen style (looks like a real cigarette) it won't do you any good.
If you really want to try it, buy yourself an Ego twist with a mini pro tank to try it out with. As for juice, I would recommend visiting Mount Baker Vapor as they have cheap liquids and are pretty decent. Start your nicotine amount at 18mg unless you were more than a pack a day, then step up to 24mg.

""I tried going cold turkey, tried e-cigs, nicotine gum, all sorts of things. Always ended up smoking again. And while everyone kept telling me that unless I stopped smoking completely i would never quit what actually did it for me was to slowly cut down. If i tried cold turkey i would always freak out and go back to smoking again after a week. I went from 20 a day to 10 and kept it that way for a few months. Then i cut that in half again to 5. After a few more months i went down to 2 and then to 1. I slowly got my body used to less nicotine whilst also getting used to not always reaching for so many cigarettes. I stayed on 1 a day for a few more months as although it was hard and i was craving during the day, knowing that i would be able to have a cig after dinner kept me from panicking like i would when i went cold turkey. I kept saying to myself whenever i had a bad craving just hang on a few more hours and you can smoke. After a while it was really easy to drop from 1 cigarette to none. My body had already gotten used to the drop in nicotine and loss of habit. Its been a year and a half and i've not smoked since. Feels fantastic.

I should also mention two others factors which really helped. I met my then girlfriend (now wife) who was a non smoker, and she really helped open my eyes as to how bad it smelt, health issues etc. I also settled down my lifestyle quite a bit with her. Before i was going out to pubs and bars a lot with my mates (who all smoked) and after a few beers you almost cant not light up. With that gone it became a whole lot easier too.""Fill up a vessel with water. You may choose to use a kitchen pot or a plastic liter container, etc. After every cigarette you smoke, discard the butt into the water. Now comes the fun part. Take a sip.

So I couldnt' justify to myself that a father would burn money on smokes and shorten his life when he was responsible for another human being."One night during the holidays I got wasted and smoked a pack of cigs in a few hours span. The next day I had the WORST hangover I have ever had. Threw up all day long and was totally bed ridden. I have never smoked a cigarette since! Smoked for 5/6 years have now been quit for 3! 

I had an uncle who was hypnotized and that worked for him. He smoked 30+ years! "Finding out I had cancer was a huge motivation to quit."1) you have to actually WANT to quit.

2) read Allan Carr's 'Easy way to quit smoking'. I bought the mp3 on iTunes. 10 bucks 9 months ago. Haven't spent a penny on tobacco products since. "I read Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking - worked on my and 15 of my girlfriends (we were all in a book club together). i started dipping... not really a huge problem solver"I smoked for twenty years. My health and the cost made me decide to quit. I got the patches, took them like it said and never looked back. One drawback to quitting is, before i weighed 160 now i'm 230 2 years later.""I just stopped. It actually wasn't that difficult. The physical withdrawal wasn't that noticeable, and the psychological withdrawal was just a matter of telling myself no. If you have any semblance of willpower and impulse control, it's not hard to quit smoking at all."I just...stopped. Made myself focus on something else when I had cravings. I picked it up while bartending and dropped it as soon as my dad passed away from cancer.

I knew I'd never get another chance like that again to have such a hugely symbolic ""fresh slate"" (even though I knew that the actual millennium changover happened the year earlier).

I still like to say I haven't smoked a cigarette since last century.""Work was always my trigger as well. However, I figured out the best way for me to personally stop smoking was to change my habits. I started working out at night when I would usually chain smoke on the deck, wash my hands right after I eat instead of have a quick smoke, play games on my phone during work break instead of smoke, etc... cut from a half pack a day down to nothing in a manner of a few days, been off ever since. Hope this helps a little.""I started smoking when i was 13 and smoked a pack a day for 17 years. I had tried quitting before, and actually quit once for around 8 months before casually lighting up when drinking with a few friends. I was still claiming to be a non-smoker and hiding it from my wife. I would smoke in the car with my hand out the window, smoke at work and chew gum before i got inside, hiding packs of cigarettes, etc. I was miserable and really didnt even enjoy smoking anymore but i couldnt stop. 

Then one day i woke up, said fuck it and never picked up a smoke again. Cold turkey, I was just DONE with it. Done freezing my ass off outside, done hiding it from my wife, done spending money on it, done smelling like an ashtray, done being a slave to the addiction. 

Weird thing is when i originally quit, i craved to smoke the ENTIRE time. Since i officially quit, i havent had a single urge. In fact the smell and even the thought of smoking disgusts me now. Its been 1 year this February.

""What worked for me after several failed attempts (with and without electronic cigs), was to reward myself in some other way. So whenever I had a craving, I would use the money I saved from buying Cigs and buy a Blu-Ray movie under $10. Then I'd go home and watch the movie to keep my mind from wandering. I got a reward from buying the movie, and a second reward while watching it.
Surprisingly, if you smoke about a pack a day... you spend about 2 hours smoking. So watching a 2 hour movie took the same time, and spending $10 was about the same too.
Now I'm smoke free and have a large blu-ray collection! Easy to quit collecting blu-rays too. lol. And give yourself 2 solid weeks before you can smile and laugh again.""I tried twice to quit and was unsuccessful. Then, last December I got diagnosed with Hepatitis C. It was completely unexpected, but the day I got diagnosed was the last day I had a cigarette or a drink. Just knowing that smoking (and drinking) will give me cirrhosis and liver cancer decades before I will get it naturally in my condition made me stop. 

Basically all you need is a really good reason and quitting cold turkey is not that hard. After 3 days my cravings lessened, after a week it was fairly easy. Plus, I noticed that my lung capacity doubled. I would take a breath and feel like I was gonna explode from having too much air in me. It was crazy. Now I'm able to run and work out all the time which is another great deterrent to picking the habit back up. "I was surrounded by smokers who never had any cigarettes of their own and got tired of only getting to smoke a third of a pack of my own cigarettes.  So I mentally prepared myself (the most important part) and bought a pack of nicotine patches.  Also I've noticed that your first cigarette of the day is the one that leads you to want the next one and so on and so forth.  Also nicotine patches make you have crazy dreams which is a plus."I'm not a smoker myself, but I will never forget the day that my dad literally just said 'I'm going to quit smoking'. Since that day on he has never smoked once."Keep tryingI quit by making a firm decision and from that point not smoking anymore cigarettes. The worst of it only lasted four days. Mild to moderate cravings lasted six months. I've been off cigarettes now for over three years.Having a non-addictive personality and physiology"I smoked for forty-odd years and never thought I'd stop, but I used the nicotine patches and stopped immediately.  If I can do  it, anyone can.
Oh yes, just like black sabbath, i piled the weight on.""well two things:

first: i caught a very bad cold, unable to move for 4 days. When I got better, I realized that I haven't smoked while beeing sick. From then on, I continued encouraging myself with:"" I haven't smoked for x days, I can live without it another day (x+1)"" on a daily basis.

second: after a few weeks old habits and stress etc nearly got me but I was willing to stay strong. Nicotin-candy from the pharmacy. Pure nicotin without smoking helped me for roughly 2 month time. After that, it was easy.

6+ years and still no smoke.""My friend quit last year after ~15 years of regular smoking. There wasn't any mental trick for him. He knew he was hastening his own death, which alone wasn't so bad. His wife is a non-smoker, but she was willing to let him keep it up as long as he kept it under control and out of the house. But after realizing they had a kid on the way he basically just stopped.  ""I used ecigs. Although not technically quitting I guess. Life is much better. Save money, feel better. Although Im not ""quitting"". I have every intention to start smoking again when I get old. So im taking a break from smoking.""I can totally empathize with you. I am a nurse, and work in ER and urgent care settings. I would literally go 10+ hours without peeing or eating. It started as just going on break with the smokers, and eventually turned into me smoking with them. It was the worst mistake of my life but it didn't seem like it at first, getting those smoke breaks were worth it to me at first. The only thing that worked for me was chantix. And not going on breaks with the smokers anymore.""Desire to live forever. It all comes down to having the right reason, whatever that reason is for you. It might seem silly, but I think that immortality is within our grasp. If I can live long enough to make it, I just might live forever. I couldn't let something as stupid as smoking cut me short. I don't know why, but it worked for me. That was the strong enough reason.""It's not as easy to control, but getting sick is a great way. If you're ready feeling like crap and coughing up phlegm, why make it worse? Combine your sickness with any withdrawal symptoms and get all those shitty feelings out of the way at the same time. If you already want to quit it's not a bad way to go. 

I got strep throat really bad where it hurt to smoke and I didn't feel like going outside to light up. After 3 days of that and no nicotine, I figured I could just keep it up. I was right. Not a cigarette in a year and a half now. 

Go lick a few public doorknobs OP. Your sickness will be your cure. "Chantix was the only thing that worked for me. Several failed attempts before the drug. I did not have any negative side effects. It was a miracle for me. Almost 5 years ago. Still smoke free. "I smoked about a pack or two a day for about ten years, failed at quitting at least 5 times.  It's not a big deal if you fail at this just keep trying.  Nicotine gum was worked for me.  It had the similarity of being oral and the convince of indoor use.  E-ciggs weren't around back then so I can't say for sure, but going outside doesn't seem like it would help.  I used the gum quite a bit of it, maybe even more than the box recommends.  I also used the gum for more than a year.  I didn't give a crap about the additional expense of all the gum, I was thinking about the long run horizon.  If you've tried the gum and read the instructions you'll know about ""pocketing"" the gum.  I used the gum so much I had to have about 4 places to alternate as pockets.  This may be awful advice but it can't be worse than smoking.  Switching up the flavor you use helps, even if you don't like the flavor.
I very slowly weened my self down the potency, again taking way longer than recommended with the same justification as before.  

Eventually I replaced the nicotine gum with normal gum.  Its been several years now so I'd say it worked.  I still get the urge to smoke.  For me the trigger is doing something I haven't done since I quit smoking.  I went skiing a few weeks ago, haven't skied in nearly 20 years, and I wanted to smoke at every step.  Got the crap unloaded, wanna have a smoke.  Got the tickets purchased, better have a smoke.  You get the point.  By the end of the day I didn't want to smoke anymore.  

Morals: Don't get worked up if you fail, try again.  If you find something that works for you exploit it.  
  ""I stopped telling myself ""this is my last smoke, ever""

That thought just made me too sad. 

I also made a goal for myself and to reward my non-smoking with a nice cigar every new year and midsummers eve. 

Another thing was I used a ""waterpipe"" (or shisha) almost every weekend to get me through the first few weeks.

BOOM."e-cigs and my mom getting cancer "I smoked for 12 years, went to the hospital because I was short of breath and could not walk very far. Spent 2 weeks in the hospital, couldn't smoke while in it. When I got out I tried to smoke one cig and I couldn't finish it.

The nightmares are awful but after 13 years smoking I am now 2 years and 9 months tobacco free.  And have zero desire to smoke.  Hope that helps."You HAVE to be ready to do it, have a reason, and have a constant reminder. You need an exercise to do in lieu of smoking to distress, I go for a short, brisk walk and chew a LOT of gum. I work at a call center so I know what you mean about triggers and breaks. Going for a walk really helps. 
I got an ecig too, which helps, but when it dies or I forget it I have that temptation to go buy cigarettes, so I would highly recommend going cold turkey, power through it for 2 weeks and everything will be uphill from there. Good luck!!!
EDIT: Grammar "Stopped drinking"I've never really been addicted, i know people say that all the time, but ive stopped for the second time now, and i literally just stopped. For me smoking was never about the nicotine buzz, it was doing something when bored on break at work, i just occupy that time with reading now.""Vaping helped me quit.  I just switched one day to Blu Cigs, high strength. Then I weaned down to low strength over 2 months.   After another month, I switched to no nicotene.  I found them to be a bit pricey, so I switched to the refill vapes,  i.e. iGo v4.  I've been using the iGo v4 for the last two months and its awesome.  I plan to wean off vapes altogether sooner or later.  I'd been a smoker for 14 years and nothing worked for me until vaping came along - I tried EVERYTHING. ""After smoking for 18 years, I finally quit for the 3rd time in 1999.  i tried the Nicorette patch, but it made me dizzy and I was on lots of medication for my MS.  finally after about three weeks of the patch, I went cold turkey.  My son was 8 and I didnot want to have to explain to him why I was sick from smoking, which could have been prevented.  it wasnt easy but this time I won.  however, even after 15 years smoke free- I still have dreams that i have gone back to smoking.""for me, the hardest part about quitting was (""is"" since i am only on day 4) is getting to learn how to do things without the cigarette in my hand. it is not so much the cigarette that is hard to get rid of, but the routine around smoking, for me.  the electronic cigarettes do it for me. i am currently using them. i smoke them every time i drive, at work during breaks, after meals, usually all the times i would smoke. and for the time in between i chew gum...lots and lots of gum. in four days i have gone through 4 disposables and three packs of gum. the main thing for me was finding something to keep my mind focused. new video games help a lot, my wife helps since i always give her my attention. also, bronchitis helped me for like 3 months...but then i hacked and coughed through a couple of cigarettes anyway....not a good choice.

EDIT: i really enjoy smoking. the health issues and all that jazz, i never really cared for any of it. i know what could and will eventually happen if i continue to smoke. and time and time again i hear people tell me ""i don't even know why i smoke. it is disgusting i do not even like it."" it was never like that for me. i enjoy it. i like looking at the smoke, and the cherry. i like flicking the ashes and watching them float around in my car in the wind. i sit here and think ""maybe i should just smoke electronics and i can have all the smoking without the early death"" but then i think there is no real point to that. i always considered it a hobby more than a habit. i never disliked it. i am quitting though. so...i cannot tell you why....i do not really have a reason other than it feels like that is what i am supposed to do.""Cold Turkey worked the first three times.  Each time I quit was from a few months up to 10 years.  Then acupuncture - that was the easiest.  One hard day then the second day after quitting, NOTHING.  No cravings, nothing.  This final time, the patch with lozenges.  It's a mix between cold turkey tough and the easiness of acupuncture.  It's a bit slower, but much more manageable.

Edit:  Oh yeah, and one time I had bronchitis so bad I was dizzy just standing up to go to the bathroom.  That made it pretty easy.
""Smoked for seven years and i quit last summer. Like alot of people here have said, i just decided to stop. No more. The first couple of weeks i chew alot of gum.

However, i still use snus maybe two-three times a month.""I tried countless times to quit smoking in my early 20s.  
The only thing that got me to quit for good, was buying a mountain bike and then riding it up a steep hill until I couldn't go another inch, then getting off and puking.
I never really smoked after that, though at bars I would get the occasional hankering.
I believe biking is pretty much the key to all happiness in life."staying away from people who smoke so I wouldn't want to bum oneOne word: eCigs."Late as usual, but maybe thus I will help? I had to get to the point that I was absolutely sick of smoking. I hated it by the time I successfully quit. 

To make it stick I had to quit coffee and quit drinking too. Even long road trips were out. Anything I associated with smoking had to go.  

It was tough but worth it. It took just a few weeks for the regular withdrawals and cravings to go away. It took about  year before I could start drinking coffee and alcohol again without massive cravings. Now, years later I have no desire at all at any time . It's great! "Cold turkey and stop hanging around people who smoke. One day at the time...[deleted]"I smoked for 15-20 years was at 1.5-2 packs a day when i finally quit.  After trying cold turkey and Nicorette gum I decided, on a whim to try the Nicorette Inhaler.  Bought one instead of a pack of cigarettes one day and never smoked again.   

I recommended it to my girlfriend and a co-worker and it worked for both of them as well.  I can't recommend it enough.""I didn't smoke a cigarette for one day. ""If I can go to bed without having a smoke today, then I'm set."" I thought that and it became easier and easier.""Sounds lame, but reading The Lord of the rings helped me quit. Reading about all these great heroes who could resist the temptation of the ring, and hope, against all hope, prevail made want to be like them. Every time I wanted a smoke, I compared it to the ring of power's temptation. It worked."i ran out of money... couldnt buy any more....Snus."My wife. Of course at the time she wasn't my wife. 

She simply said on our first ""date"", that she didn't like kissing smokers.

I quit that very night and only slipped once or twice in the 11 years since.

But as to OP failures: The key is to change your routine. Don't go out the door that everyone else does to smoke. Don't take your break at the same time as the smokers do. Also, tell EVERYONE that you are trying to quit. Tell the people you smoke with as well that you are trying to quit.

Also, dump the eCig. It is just an excuse. I know that nicotine addiction is tough, but you will do better with the gums or the patches."Family member died of lung cancer. "Champix, I have to say that after 25 years of smoking up to 40 a day, I haven't now for 12 weeks, I have never EVER gone this long, worth the crazy dreams, second attempt and I'm done, most of my friends smoke and I have no issues being with them when they do, I'm not fussed nor bothered by it anymore, I'm now also off the champix (12 weeks from quit day is today). No more cough!!!!! ""I quit in the fall of '12. It wasn't my first attempt, and what sealed the deal was me bribing myself. I calculated how much I spent on cigarettes on a bad month (over $300), and promised to buy myself a cool watch at that value if I made it to the end of the month without smoking. I did it! Then, wearing the watch discouraged me from smoking in the inevitable and MANY moments of temptation. I bought myself another watch of similar value at the end of six months, then another on my year anniversary. Treating yourself with the money you've saved is key. 
Now, I have a lovely little watch collection, and every one is a visual promise and reminder of my dedication to temperance. It worked like a charm, and I'll never smoke again. If watches aren't for you, choose something of significant value that you can wear or keep around at all times. The talismanic quality of the watches really really helps."bloodclots"This is gonna sound dumb, but just stop.  set aside 3-5 days and stay in a happy, non-stressful state.  The nicotine must be purged from your system, and the dependence must go away.  

the first 3 days are typically the hardest to get over, but after that it gets easier.  It also takes a lot of willpower.  you WILL get cravings, especially when arround others who smoke, or in situations where you would typically smoke (I smoked EVERY time I got into my car because I cant smoke at work.  It was: Start the car... Put seatbelt on... turn radio to whatever... light up and go.)  You have to tell yourself not to do it.


Alternatively, and this helped me when I broke down and smoked:  IF you break down and have one, smoke yourself sick.  Smoke 5+ in a row like your life depends on it.  you will feel sick as hell, but you wont want them again.  This method is kinda crazy, but it does work.  The whole premise is that when you smoke, it is associated with pleasure, relaxation, and happiness.  well if you replace those associations with illness, bad taste, and overall bad feelings, every time you want a smoke you will think of the times you HAVE broken down, and how horrible you felt and the cravings will vanish.""Vape store owner here. I have not seen anything work as well as an electronic cigarette. More than 90% ex-smokers that start at our store were able to switch exclusively to e-cigarettes from the moment they buy a kit. I don't sell online so i'm not trying to peddle here but really it works. 

It really depends on which type you are using. Have a look at /r/electronic_cigarette. It's a lot easier if you are using what is recommended. The regular ""blu"" or whatever else they sell at gas stations are not nearly as effective because they don't supply enough nicotine. They are a failure from the beginning. I don't know if it will work for you but get started with a cheap little ego kit or something similar where you put in your own juice and start at 20-25mg and it will cut down the cravings tremendously. Then weekly you can reduce your mg of nicotine by a few until you reach zero and put the vaporizer down. 

I tell everyone if they are really committed which you seem to be to toss the cigarettes, lighters, ash trays. 

If anyone needs help or OP, pm me.""A good friend suggested I roll up a few joints for the day and just take a puff of one when I felt the need to smoke a cigarette. After smoking for 7 years and trying to quit smoking the last 2 years, nothing was ever as effective as that. I have not smoked in over 3 years, but I smoke a joint or two a week.""I'd been telling myself I would quit for awhile and just couldnt get myself too until one day I woke up after smoking an entire pack the night before to a lump in the back of throat. Swallowing was uncomfortable and I freaked out.    It went away later that day but I really had to deal with my own mortality that morning. It was an uncomfortable feeling and helped me realize how fragile life is.  Its hard to pass on the gravity that my experience had, when I smoked I knew that they were bad for me. Hell I called them nails because every time I lit up I was ""putting a nail in the coffin.""  Death seemed so far away until it was at my proverbial doorstep and its a scary thing to face in your early 20s. Good luck quitting. You have this guys support!""I got an ecig. The blu and others at 7/11 didn't work for me, so I got an eGo T starter kit and some juices, much better. I quit as soon as I ran out of cigs, less than 24 hours. I have tried smoking a cigarette since I stopped(4 months ago), but I don't like the taste anymore. I feel much better now, never gonna go back. Oh, and when I got my kit I wasn't even intending on quitting cigs, but I when I realized I didn't need to go get another pack, I didn't. It was actually pretty easy. Plus, I've found the most addicting part of a cigarette is the additives, not so much the nicotine. I don't get strong craving for my ecig, if I go a day with out it I don't freak out like I did with cigs. ""E-Cig, actually. Simple and surprising"tonsillectomy Once I realized that I was truly ADDICTED to something - that pissed me off and provided the extra motivation I needed to go cold turkey.

Everyday I would pat myself on the back like ""hey 4 days, awesome!"" etc. Before i knew it 3 days had turned into 3 weeks and I just made 2 years. There were times i would go out drinking and smoke here and there or just slip up in general but i wouldnt beat myself up over it and i certainly wouldnt carry on smoking the next day. I also didnt let these instances make me feel like i was starting from square one either. Soon the frequency i wanted to smoke while drinking became less and less and now even when im hammered they just feel gross. The smell used to smell so attractive but now it's honestly repulsive and i cant believe i used to walk around smelling like that. So thankful i stuck with it. You can do it OP!
""deciding that I wanted to stop being controlled by the addiction is what did it for me.  finally committing to it and accepting that every excuse I came up with to smoke was a lie.  No, I don't need it to sleep, wake-up, or calm down.  No, I don't need it to feel comfortable in any social situation or when I am around another smoker.  Once I was honest with myself and actually committed I was surprised how easy it was.  I smoked for about 18 years and after attempting to quit several times had my last cigarette in the Fall of 2012.  As a bonus I've saved nearly $3,000 too.""I switched to pure weed.

His appendix exploded and he was in the hospital for about 4 days. Obviously he couldn't light up in a hospital and after he got out the doctor expressly forbid him to smoke for a while. That was almost 2 years ago now and he hasn't smoked since. He says he only really smoked when he drank (but he'd smoke like he drank, a whole case of beer and a pack of cigarettes in just a few hours.) so it's wasn't an addiction in his book because he only wanted to smoke when he drank, he never in all my years smoked without a natty/bud light in the other hand. ""I started vaping right after Christmas and I haven't looked back. I was already fed up with the stench and cost of cigarettes. I bought a ecigarette, then I sold all of my cigarettes to a friend so that I didn't have any ""fallback"" cigarettes to constantly think about. I smoked over a pack a day at one point; I smoked for about 7 years total. And I smoked name brand-menthols... those things were so fucking expensive! I just bought the ecigarette, then any time I wanted I cigarette, that's what I smoked. It's been working like a charm so far!""With a lot of support from bf and friends I quit. I tried first by gradually stop. I smoked like 10 cigarettes/day and started with restricting me to 5/day. After two weeks I tried to smoke only 3/day, but soon I was back on 5-6/day. One day I woke up and it felt like a good day to quit smoking. This was in the end of october or beginning of november -13 and I haven't touched a cigarette since! So for me it worked better with cold turkey. 
I have also found out that I smoked when I was bored.

Got horrendously ill afterwards for the next three days. 103 degree fever. More sick then I've ever been in my whole life. I was so pissed at myself for ruining three perfectly good vacation days that I vowed to quit for good.

Good luck and cheer up because it can be done!!""I just realized one day that trying nicotine gum, trying e-cigs, trying patches.. all of that was just keeping me right at that edge after quitting cigarettes themselves.

The only way -- in my opinion -- is to quit cold turkey.""Not me personally but a story about how my dad stopped smoking cold turkey after 22 years.

My dad worked in the military for 5 years to get my entire family moved from the middle east to somewhere in Europe. He did his 5 years and the government gave our family a free pass (literally) and we were sent to Sweden. 

After 6 months of being in Sweden it was our first new years in Sweden, and my dad learned about new year resolutions. His was to stop smoking so he wouldn't have worked in the military in the middle east for 5 years and then just get cancer and die. He put out his last cig just around Jan 1, 2001 and he never touched another cig. He had smoked for 22 years. The first few months were horrible for him, anyone who came near him with a cig would get him incredibly angry, eventually he got past that point and he just doesn't even look at a cig anymore."Vaping. smoked for 10 years this actually made me hate smoking"Ironically, over-smoking (more than I wanted to for a few days/weeks).

He developed COPD and decided to quit. He struggled with the usual methods and found them ineffective and decided to find a better way. He was an inventor and created several products you may recognize. He figured he could invent a better way to stop smoking. Since he woke up every morning with a terrible smokers cough, one day he decided to record himself. He did this for several weeks. Then, whenever he had a craving, he would just play the tape of him coughing and he would remember one of the reasons for quitting. So he quit cold turkey with a little help from his creative mind. Still alive today but needs oxygen every once in a while (See: COPD above). Never marketed his idea though.  "I replaced the cigarettes with gum. It annoyed the hell out of my coworkers at the time but worked out for me.

Its so hard to stop but the only thing that allows me to stop is when I start to get sick. I usually get so fed up with felling like that, I pick a day and try to quit.. Cold turkey is the only method that seems to work for me. I've tried nicotine substitutes and nothing really breaks the habit. I'm currently on day three of my attempt to quit. I've tried a few times in the past 4 years and the longest I've gone without a cigarette is about 3 months. I eventually fall back into the cycle though. If anyone has tips please help a brother out!""I started smoking when I was 14 and quit when I was 24. I used patches and they worked pretty well, the first few torturous days aside. 

The reason I decided to take the plunge was that I found my first wrinkle. I know that I should be saying that I stopped due to health concerns, but it was sheet vanity that made me quit. I sincerely do not want to be one of those old ladies with mouths like bumholes. No thank you.""Believe it or not, electronic cigarettes worked for me. And not the shitty ones you get in a gas station. Luckily there's a shop by me that makes their own juice and have the hardware to buy. I failed multiple time using the patch, lozenge, and medicine...nothing seemed to work. When I started using my e cig, I started at 16 mg , and just worked myself down to 4 before I just stopped. I think e cigs gave me that smoking effect, and I was able to hate the smell of smoke, and the taste, yes I broke twice the second time being the last. I became disgusted just from the smell that I couldn't find myself doing it ever again. From then on it was just working to lower my nicotine intake. Took almost a year...but it was worth it for me.

As I got better at running I thought about how much easier running would be if I didn't smoke, so I stopped.  Sure I relapsed every now and then but in the end traded running for smoking.  It also helped me reduce my drinking, as I smoked most when drinking.

Basically told myself not to be a pussy whenever I got a craving. After a couple weeks it got easier, although, even after 2.5 years I still crave one now and then, but most the time they just stink. Also, after about a week, you can start to think that all that week of not smoking will have just gone to waste if you light up.

Just stop, cold turkey. Accept that you're going to have a **shit** week, and then another one. 

If you can go two weeks without a single cigarette, then you're well on the way to kicking the chemical dependency on nicotine.

The next step is kicking the **habit**. That is much more about **self-control**. After the first two weeks, you no longer **need** cigarettes, you just **want** them. 

After you eliminate your chemical demendency (addiction), stopping your habitual smoking rituals is about behaviour modification.

Going on a year without one after 14 years of smoking. I've also been able to cut down the nicotine from 24mg to 3mg which you can't really do with a cigarette.

That pack lasted me  6 days,  and  was  the  last one I bought. 


On the financial side of things,  I have an extra hundred dollars every month since I'm not buying cigarettes anymore. 



So overall it was the fact that I got sick,  mixed with me being broke. Now even the smell of cigarettes turn my stomach.  It makes me wonder how people could stand being around me when I smoked.  I always thought my mom exaggerated how badly cigarettes smelled,  and now I realized how foolish I was for thinking teachers didn't smell smoke on me. ""For my mom it was getting pregnant. Once she got pregnant with my brother, she went cold turkey on everything she was using: crack, prescription pills, cigarettes, etc. She's been clean for a little over 7 years now.""I think I started by saying to myself ""no smoking in the mornings before lunch"". It came a day when the thought of smoking before lunch would make me gag. Afterwards I had a smoke after lunch, get back to work and having another one as soon as I got home. Then one after dinner. And one before going to bed.

Then I stopped doing the one before bed. Then I started dating someone who just didnt like the smell and just stopped smoking entirely. 

I was a smoker since 13. A pack every two days. Started slowing at 26. Currently smoke free for almost 5 years.

If you have the willpower to do cold turkey just do it. If not, set realistic expectations and STICK to them

""i was never a heavy smoker, i would maybe smoke 10 - 15 cigarettes a day.   once i quit when my mother in law was getting a double lung transplant but it didn't stick.

when it finally did work it was because i carried around a toothbrush and toothpaste and i would brush my teeth every time i felt the need for a smoke.  it was that little trick plus some will power (which i am fucking low on, believe me) that did it. 

to top it off, i had great breath and white teeth.

good luck.
 ""So this is what I did. My trigger was also being at work. I picked a long weekend to quit over and I smoked right up until that day then I quite cold turkey. The weekend was good because I was with my family and I really didn't want to smoke around them. When I got back to work, I still took ""smoke breaks"" with my buddies, but told them no matter what do not give me a cig if I ask, and they didn't. 5 years later I am still smoke free. Still have urges all the time, but I won't give in. Good luck to you and I hope you kick the habit. ""I just stopped putting cigarettes in my face and dealt with a week of mild withdrawal symptoms including increased appetite, mild headaches, and slight irritability. ""I really really really hate Sarah Palin. I mean I despise her. I Had been a smoker for about 20 years total, then I quit cold turkey. The thing that keeps me from smoking again is I told all my friends and family if you ever see me smoke again I will give $100 to whatever political party Sarah Palin supports. I can easily afford the $100, but it would rip into my soul to give her money. Hate can be a powerful motivator. Maybe I should write her a thank you letter.

TLDR: Find something you hate and promise to donate money to it if ever smoke again.""If you really wanna quit, it's very easy. Don't use nicotine patches or gum or vapers, because you will still have nicotine in your system. Don't use bullshit excuses to light up a cigaret again, it's just willpower to break a nasty habbit.

Truth be told, it it was 100% safe for your health and didn't cost a fortune, i would still be smoking, but we all know that ain't the case, after 4 years i feel better, much better and that keeps me going.""One day I just woke up and decided I would finally stop. No patches or e-cigs. Just good old fashioned cold turkey. First day was rough towards the end. Sleeping was difficult. Day 2 was fine and after 3 days I didn't even thinking about it. Just absolute conviction. The hardest part was drinking. 
I still enjoy a cigarette if im blind drunk but in the morning thats all it is.. a drunking fling with an old mistress. The bitch!! ""I quit dozen of times and always went back after a month.  Recent act of quitting, I used the e-cig with high nicotine content for over 4 years without touching tobacco.    5th year I went to pure glycerine with no nicotine to appease my habits.   When I was ready to quit, I did it when I had the least free time and used chewing tobacco only when I was in the car for more than 4 hours.   Been over a year smoke free....get most of my cravings when I am bored, so keep busy.""I stopped wearing jackets and sweatshirts when I went out with my friends. Since I hate being cold, it wasn't worth it to go outside and smoke.

Also a girl I was trying to take out said she wouldn't date a smoker, so that too.""I noticed my roommate having the best luck when he would have candies, like mints and jolly ranchers to suck on while he was quitting. Other friends found drinking through a straw to help as well.

Something to do with your hands also helps lots too!"E cigarettes. ....make it a small hobby. I smoked for 18yrs only quit when pregnant.  I smoked both at first. After 3weeks the smokes started to taste like shit. Last smoke I had was in OctoberI quite by using a electronic cig.  I bough a high quality one (not one from a mall or seen in advertisements) and it gave me the nictotine and action of smoking that cured the cravings....I eventually reduced the nicotine to 0 and was able to stop completely. The only two times I've managed to quit for more than a month or two was using Champix (I think it's Chantix in the US). Admittedly I'm a weak person and using anti-smoking meds was the only way I've ever managed to quit successfully. They are very effective. Unfortunately I just had a breakup and started again after being smoke free for a year. I feel like an ass but I'm going to get myself a new prescription since it's a new year and it will be free.Ecigs. and not the crappy njoy or blu ecgigs check out www.preferredvapor.comVape man "Nicotine causes erectile dysfunction,  even in many young people.

Download an app to track it for you. It helps seeing how far along you are and how much money you've saved. Use an aid. It is very hard to quit cold turkey. *You're not going to be any less proud a year down the road if you used a stop-smoking-aid!* 

Edit: I used the nicorette mini lozenge. The bigger lozenges made my lips white like that Dave Chapelle character-not a good look. If you have insurance, try Chantix. I know a 2-pack-a-day smoker who has successfully quit using Chantix. You can try the patch. I found them the irritate my skin and burn. There's also the gum. I'm not a huge gum guy though. 

You can't go wrong with the mini lozenge. Go buy them at Walmart. You can buy a single vial for $8 instead of the $50 kit at cvs or walgreens. 

Stay strong!"I had a bad bronchitis that would not let me sleep until 4 am for two weeks. After that i never smoked a cigarette again. Still smoke weed though.bought an ecig. didn't even have to try to quit honestly."I decided to stop.  The only reason why I smoke now is because I enjoy it, and I used to tell people I'm not quitting, just stopping for a while and that I will stop up again.  People learned to stop saying that I'm addicted because I ask them how much they're willing to pay me to quit and for how long that I'll do it.  A year, 2 years, just get the price right and I will quit.  How long does someone need to stop to prove they aren't addicted?  Anyways, no one has taken me up on the offer ever, and they very quickly stop saying that I'm addicted and can't stop (especially since I have stopped on my own plenty of times before for 6 months or a year, and then actually say, I think I'm going to start smoking again).  You can't quit because you don't want to."I haven't seen many people mention it but my mom finally quit after about 4 failed attempts at cold turkey using chantix. She said she had weird nightmares but that it was the only thing that completely worked for her. It's been about 7 years since she smoked."Getting a significant other who did not smoke, and did not approve of it.

I had been on and off for 3-4 years, but never managed to finally kick the habit.. that was the push i needed to finally call it quits.""I had wanted to quit already, and tried the patch with mixed results. Mixed being ""worked, until it didn't"".

Unrelated, I was sick for a week, and smoking was tasteless & not fun (as it is when you're sick), so I didn't smoke that week. I woke up, feeling pretty good, and thought I was better, so I lit up my last cigarette. Nope. Tasted like ash.

The combination of not smoking for a week while I had a cold, being out of cigarettes, and the nastiness of a big drag while sick gave me just the bit of push I needed to stay off for 2 more weeks. The 3rd week was tough, but I just kept staying away from places where I could buy them, sort of a ""if I can't see them, I won't think about them"" mentality. Also, I stopped going outside with my smoker buddies, and buried myself in my work. No breaks except for nature. That sort of thing.

It got easier from 4 weeks on. I didn't consider myself as having quit until the 60 day mark went by. I had cravings for about 6 months after that. Still do, sometimes.

I miss it, too. But not going to do it again. On the one hand, smoking is awesome. On the other, it kills you, costs a bunch of money, ages your skin, and makes you smell bad. But it's still a pleasure. Damn it.""On Christmas last year, I caught the H1N1 virus. I was unable to really breathe, much less smoke. I stayed sick for over 2 weeks and couldn't smoke the entire time. I didn't really feel withdrawals because i was so sick and achy that I just didn't notice them.  After i started getting better, I decided to just throw them away. The only hard thing to deal with is oral fixation and time that is now free.""Five days a non smoker here.  Allen Carr's The Easy Way taught me a lot that I didn't know.  Successful for two years at a time for my last three quits, but ""just one"" always kept me getting hooked again.  Needed to get a new perspective and The Easy Way did it for me this time.  You build up to your last cigarette- you commit- and you have your last one and (spoiler alert) you are a non smoker.  That's it.  I'm currently going through the ""holy crap, lungs, what are those"" phase and am slightly concerned that five days in I blow my nose and blood clots are still coming out of my sinuses.

I am smoke free for about 5years now.""laziness. I forced myself to walk to the store if I wanted a cigarette. When I got to the store I forced myself to walk back before buying a cigarette. Got back home and turned around to go back, never made it. Put obstacles in front of your habit and test your resolve. Remember that each second, minute, hour, day and so on are accomplishments. Why ruin a good thing? 

Do not set a date. ""Honestly, an E-cig. Not one of those tiny Blu ones or the like. The one I had a large silver shaft and a mouth piece at the end. It came with flavored vapor liquids that could have different levels of nicotine content. 

I got a liquid that tasted like peanut butter cookies with a nicotine level that was about what a pack a day smoker would be used to.

Whenever I had a craving I would take a few puffs from my e-cig and I could literally feel the craving alleviate from my brain. After a while I just forgot about cigarettes in a daily basis sort of way. I also lost my e cig at a party, but after I still didn't buy any more packs.

Disclaimer: this is just my experience.  I still indulge in cigarettes when I drink, which is not very often. It all depends on you, the individual. ""Congrats on continuing to try beating the habit! Every attempt gets you closer.
I smoked 40 cigarettes a day for 30 years, and managed to quit after a couple of attempts.
What worked for me?  I was blackmailed into it by my surgeon who refused to perform a gall bladder op until I quit. I was in so much pain, I agreed. I quit, going cold turkey, two weeks before the surgery, and by the time I was out of hospital another week had passed. Although I still had the urge to smoke, I was finally off them. 
So, a couple of tips:
1: remove temptation...throw away lighters, ashtrays, whatever you have that facilitates your habit.
2: understand that the cravings will pass. Try distracting yourself when they get really bad by doing something completely different with you hands. I took up needlepoint. That may not be practical or appealing for you, but it doesn't matter what it is: wood carving, or card tricks. I found it helped to establish a new pattern to break the old.
3: finally, just like an alcoholic, I had to understand that even though I quit,  i will be a smoker for the rest of my life. It's just that each day I choose not to smoke.
Good luck. I am so grateful to that surgeon, now. I have been a non-smoker for 13 years. You too CAN do it! Keep trying. "I got sick with a bad cold and never went back after smoking for 20 years.

For my 5 year birthday, I refused to take any presents. When he didn't bring one, I asked that he only quit for me. Being his only son, he has not smoked in 11 years.""V2 e cig worked for me. It'll be year next month, and I don't miss it a bit.
""If you have enough valuable reasons to quit, you can decide to quit by just focusing on those reasons. For me, it was singing, saving money, and saving allure (I thought not smoking would be classier lol). Completely vain reasons, but they worked for me. Being in choir and liking the sound of my voice and being able to run to class and not feel like I was dying pretty easily outweighed the relief I got from smoking. 

Also, I had a few ""relapses"" after I decided to completely quit buying them. Each time is relapse id focus on how disgusting it made me smell afterwards that it just added anxiety rather than alleviate it. Now when my boyfriend lights up the occasional smoke, I just focus on how suffocating the smell is to keep me unattracted. 

Tip: don't ever decide to be an ""occasional"" smoker at the bar if you really want to quit. Instead, look at all the rest of the smokers like they are where you used to be, and how hard it will be for them when they want to quit. You will always feel classier and stronger at a party if you aren't smoking, and that's a way better feeling then paying for nicotine to give you confidence. ""Ask a friend to handcuff you to a basement pipe when you have a week or two of vacation. Make sure you have enough room for exercise, food, and entertainment. But make sure you cannot get any cigarettes. After a week of being in prison for smoking, you'll not only get over it, but you will associate prison with smoking. That's the last alternative if the nicotine gum, patch, etc. does not work. It's an addiction and that's how addicts rehabilitate (somewhere where they are forced to quit). Will you relapse? Maybe. Hopefully not."The patch + knowing I was finally ready to quit worked for me. It'll be 7 years this summer since I've had one."I finally tapered off after trying several times to quit. I was inspired by my fiancee. it took a couple of months to finally be done. now, several years later, I can actually have a cigarette while drinking and not want one later. I also quit drinking except for the occasiona beer or glass of wine at dinner.""Realized that I had a problem with cigarettes. I was addicted and I needed to quit. The nicotine gum also helped. When I started with the gum, I did not follow the directions of one piece every half hour, I just chewed a piece whenever I got the craving, which was a lot. I was a two pack a day smoker, for a little over ten years. It was still real hard and took a lot of will power to stay away from smoking. I quit 14 years ago and still miss the habit.""I smoked for three years, and basically had been trying to quit intermittently ever since I first started. 

What actually got me to quit, finally, was reading a book by Mike Carr, recommended to my by the /r/stopsmoking subreddit. It's not that the book has magical healing powers, it just made me realize that I truly did not enjoy cigarettes. 

The thing is, cigarettes suck, and we all know it. The only pleasure that comes from them is the pleasure of relieving the symptoms of withdrawal - which is caused by cigarettes themselves. If you don't like tasting shit, feeling like shit, and becoming impotent and cancerous, then you won't have trouble quitting.

But then I fell on some rough times where I was only able to afford a cigarette a day if that. After a while I started to realize the feeling I got for those five minutes and the short nicotine high after wasn't worth the way I smelled for the rest of the day. No matter the body spray, lotion, soap I used it was still stuck to my clothes and in my hair and began to repulse me. I quit cold turkey for a few months and to my surprise I started having more energy. My daily runs were stronger and pulling better times. My general outlook felt better.

I started about 18 months ago, by using an NRT therapy called Quickmist - a spray of minty nicotine from a dispenser kind of like a breath-freshener spray. I quite liked it, and i wasnt in any hurry to stop using it, but its not available in Germany so my supplies were sometimes limited. I used this for around a year, still getting the kick i needed, and maybe having the ocasional cigarette when i was out with mates, but never buying a full pack myself. I carried the Quickmist for a long time, until around November last year, when i switched to the Niquitine Minis mints, the little tiny mint lozenges. These were quit nice, and i used them for about 4 weeks, to replace the spray and get used to having a mint rather than the spray whenever i needed a boost. After about 4 weeks of using the mints, i started carrying normal mints around, as well as the nicotine ones, and gradually started taking normal mints instead of nicotine ones whenever i felt tetchy. When i finally stopped altogether, there was a period of about 1 week where i was a miserable git, eating mints the whole time, but now at the end of January, im not eating mints and im not using nicotine at all! And i feel pretty good about it - i can stand to be near smokers, although i dont appreciate the smell and i have been out for drinks and gone out with friends without even thinking about cigarettes at all.""I DO NOT RECOMMEND HOW I DID IT.

Just when I really need to calm down and take the edge off - the cigarette did nothing for me; zero.

That cigarette failed to deliver any comfort / relaxation when I needed it most and I realized they offer a false promise. I haven't had the slightest desire to smoke a cigarette since then - more than 2 years.""This isn't going to help much, I'm afraid, but I just stopped. I decided one day that I didn't want to smoke any more and so I didn't. I should point out several things:

1. This wasn't my first attempt at stopping, although I never did try any of the chewing gums, patches or other things to help me.

2. This method almost certainly _will not work_. Out of all of the possible methods for quitting this is the worst and the least likely to succeed. I am a freak anomaly and should _not_ be used as a role model (for anything).

Once I didn't want to smoke at work anymore, I stopped smoking after meals.

I spent 11 straight months. There were rollies available for $5, but I simply couldn't see paying that much for so little. 1 rollie was 1/3 of a cigarette. When I got out, and had shirt pockets again, I, out of habit, tapped my pocket to check on my pack. I only did that once.  That was all the way back in 1997. I figure I've saved over $15, 000. "the price for a pack of cigarettes in chicago is $12.  at some point its just not worth putting down that kinda money.  rather get booze"Ex-smoker after about thirteen years, varying from a couple a day to a pack a day, usually dependent on school/family/job stress. Finding things to do, and being on the way somewhere rather than loitering about, definitely cut down on opportunities to smoke; there used to be no more tempting situation for me than hanging out with buddies or trying to relax after a rough day. 

I finally kicked the habit when I started seriously rock climbing. Smoking a cigarette might nice, but the air is thin enough on the mountain without lowering the oxygen level even more. Hiking helped as well, since it got me outdoors and moving for days at a time. After a couple months, I could see a marked improvement from gasping like a fish out of water after the first three miles to being able to just as easily hold a conversation while hiking as enjoying the scenery.

I still feel the urge to light up once in a while when I'm back in those old situations, but it's more like a passing ""oh that would have been nice"" thought these days, rather than the desire to smoke I used to have to contend with daily. When I'm out, I might go outside to continue a conversation with a smoker, but it feels pretty empowering to be able to politely turn down a cigarette. 

@babiesarthritis: stress smoking was a big hurdle for me as well when I worked in a smoker-friendly environment; if you're only allowed a break when you need to smoke, try vaping with water only - just the action of it might be familiar and comforting enough to help you gradually eliminate this from your life. Stay strong, and good luck!"Actually wanting to quit."There is no 'quitting' smoking.  You are either a smoker or you are not.  One day I made the decision to become a non smoker after smoking for several years.  I was sick, puking for about 3 days, but after that I was fine.  I felt a hell of a lot better than I typically ever did.

So quit quitting and become a non-smoker.  I know it takes a lot of will power, but once your brain is trained that you are a non-smoker your conviction will keep you there.

Some people relapse when they get off the drug, friend of mine did, but he tried again and it worked so far (3 years on). Ive been clean for the same time. I didnt do the full course of the drug as i felt it worked for me, but it is recommended you do the whole treatment.

Some people have some strong reactions to this drug, but i was lucky as i didnt notice any side effects. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to quit, but dont quit because you are being made to quit, quit because YOU want to, otherwise it will never work.
""Electronic cigarette. When i converted. I stuck to it for a good month. I tried a cigarette a month later and the taste was horrible. So I could only smoke a cigarette when i was drunk. Its now been 6 months and cigarettes tastes and smell nasty. Its not exactly quitting smoking but you will stop  smoking cigarettes. Now they only time I really rely on my e cig is when im drinking other wise i can do with out it.
"I was never a heavy smoker but I was at about two packs a week. I quit on NewYears and have had a few since but right now I'm at work on a drilling rig sharing a shack with a heavy smoker. You'd think this would bother me but I'm so grossed out that I really don't want one. "I started running daily and smoking began to hurt, I also drank a whackload of water and stopped hanging out with smokers for a while. Once the urge stopped I didn't want to go out for smokes with them anymore, and strangely our friendship dwindled.""My parents quit after 30+ of smoking by using chantex. My dad still sneaks a smoke every now and then and mom is gonna kill him one of these days, but she's 100% smoke free. Never thought I would see the day to be honest."Champix."I was prescribed Welbutrin for depression. I just didn't feel any desire to keep smoking. But after I stopped the medication for about a week or so, I get the urge to smoke again.

Talk to a doctor about getting Welbutrin I suppose.""When I realized I was a statistic, and some guy was enjoying martini's on the beach and bankrolling knowing there was only some odd % chance I would actually quit if I even tried...and the fact COPD is a near definite""Getting pregnant. It was one thing to fuck with my own health, but I couldn't take someone else down with me. ""Staring at a pile of butts in my ash tray and realizing that crap was going into my body. Quit cold turkey, never looked back. When you get a craving, replace it with something. A lollipop works.""Not me, but my parents. 

I managed to get them to not smoke around me when I was younger, but they full out quit when they realized they were paying my university tuition equivalent in smokes a year when I left for university. 

House is so much more pleasant now. My Mom no longer likes chocolate as much as she did, however. ""I was 35 and my dentist found a pre-cancerous growth under my tongue.  I quit that night and started with the gum.  Biopsy came back negative, and the growth eventually shrunk to nothing after I'd quid.  It's been 4 years now and not a single relapse, so for me it was gum + cancer threat.  ""I finished my pack, and didn't buy more. My girlfriend (now fiancÌ©) didn't know I smoked, I didn't smoke any day I saw her until after the date was over. ECigs didn't work for me. Cold turkey did, now 2 years sans cigarettes, after smoking off and on 16 years (half my life at the time)."I lie that I don't smoke. I smoke almost two packs of cigarettes a day. Alcohol seems missing. These are all very touching. I used patches in combination with lozenges at the advice of my doctor. Much more practical than love. "This will probably be buried and never seen, but what worked for me was sheer anger. Anger at my treatment as a smoker, anger at the effects it had on my health, anger at the larger and larger dent it was making in my wallet.On September 24th, 2011 I had went on lunch after a shift at work and was sitting in my truck smoking and reading the day's newspaper when I came across a story about the city council enacting higher local sales tax on tobacco products for the fourth time that year, and enacting new, much more severe fines for people smoking outside anywhere without it being a designated smoking area. 

It was the straw that broke the camel's back. I put out my cigarette, seethed in rage the rest of my lunch, and when starting my second shift of the day to cover a coworker asked my friend and assistant manager if he wanted the half pack of unfiltered camels I had left. He left them in the office, and at the end of my shift when I reassured him I was done he put them in the first aid kit with instructions to smoke one if I felt the overwhelming urge to kill someone. 

I held on to that initial bout of white hot rage, and every time I felt I might need a puff I would stoke it higher and turn it inward. Every craving was suffocated with memories of slipping away to smoke and missing bits of graduations, weddings, birthdays, anniversaries of people I knew and cared about. Every urge to buy smokes in a checkout line defanged by the slip of paper on the back of my credit card with the amount I had spent on the habit over fifteen years at two packs of unfiltered camels a day, the most expensive brand on the market in most places.

About the middle of the fourth day I drew a deep lungful of air while stretching after I got out of bed, and it was like a new kind of high. My body started rewarding me for beating the addiction after every trace of nicotine was gone by giving me a low grade runners high, everything tasted and smelled so much sharper, sweeter and better, and I can say with conviction that I haven't wanted one since. I don't even mind my friends smoking around me, and I definitely don't bash them for not quitting or say they should because that annoyed me when 
I smoked. When they are ready to quit I will help, no need to preach at them.

 So my advice is to get mad at it. Get utterly pissed at every effect it has had, and at the lies the Marlboro Man and Joe Camel pitched about how great life would be, how cool you would look, how many women would love you if you smoked. Screw that anger up tight, light it with trembling fingers like your first cigarette, and draw deep. Turn it inward, don't lash out because that blows off too much steam and releases rage at innocents. If you can hold it three or four days until the Nicotine leaves your system you have it beat. Don't let it back in. Stay firm, stay angry, and stay social because your friends, family and co-workers will be cheering you on and don't deserve your anger. ""Nicolette gum. I did not follow the recommendations. I only chewed a half piece .. Sucked on it mainly.. Tried to put off the gum as much as possible. 

When jonesing was particularly bad, I'd do this breathing thing:

Exhale as much air as possible. 
Breath in and keep sucking air in, over inflating your lungs as much as possible. Hold as long as possible. Let out the air slowly and then breathe normally. I always felt totally satisfied after this. 

Good luck. The best advice I ever got was to keep trying. Don't beat yourself up if you falter. You are human and this is addiction. Relapse is a part of recovery. 

Eventually it will stick. 
""Haven't had a job so I can't really afford them. Was sick of the taste, the smell, the coughing, and also realized they make me anxious. I honestly don't crave them EVER anymore unless I'm drunk, which still isn't enough to go out and buy a pack. I'm very lucky the craving has gone away."Deciding to stop smoking.... Once you commit there is no turning back.My girlfriend. We moved together and she didnt liked the smoke. But a hookah sometimes is still fine!Is quitting dipping tobacco about the same as smoking? Seems like there's less motivation though."Not me, but my dad.

"I looked at a bank statement....My ecig does the job. Its a fun hobby and I'm down to 0 nicotine for awhile now but still enjoying the vapor. :)Negative physical feedback did the trick for me. Anytime I got a craving I would pinch myself hard enough to make me wince. It seemed to make the cravings go away sooner as my brain learned that a nicotine craving would lead to an immediate pain response."You have to decide to quit and then follow through.  Only thing that works, fuck the gimmicks.""Chew gum. Because when I was smoking I got caught by my gf and she told me what is it going to be the smoking or me? So I quit and ive been chewing gum, I chew Big red or Extra Mint. Try that or try not thinking about it. Think about something else. I hope this helps if not than I failed ""I got really lucky. My aunt who is wealthy told me if I could quit in six  months she would give me 1000$. If I ever light up again I have to pay her back. As far as physically quitting, my issue was the hand-mouth activity so I ate pretzel rods and chewed gum, etc. I tried the patch but I'm so small it just made me sick. I found it helpful if I was craving to wait ten minutes, and if I still really wanted the cig I would have one. Most times I would forget I wanted one. The hardcore cravings stop after two weeks, but the temptation never goes away: it's been five years and everyone once in a while someone lights up and I go ""mm that looks good"". I think quitting cold turkey is the best result. I ended up doing that and while it sucked, it makes it less tempting to start again if you don't have a pack lying around. I don't think there is a true trick to quitting, just finding what works. But I find most people I know who tried the ""weaning"" process just end up smoking again under stress. You have to be strong and just throw them away or finish the pack and never buy again! I think you can do it! PM me if you want any support!

Edit: spelling  "My Mom quit when her body was riddled with cancer and she didn't have the strength to light up.What did it for me was embarrassment. I developed a chronic cough that was the subject of constant teasing at my workplace and also with my in laws. I have been smoke free for about a year now and the annoying cough of mine is also gone. "Pick up smoking something more worthwhile like Marijuana. Still a bit bad for you, but you'll smoke less of it and at least you can get some other uses out of it. "I just stopped because I looked like a poseur and stopped working in kitchens. Nicotine poisoning. I get nauseous  at the smell of smoke now but I don't smoke anymore"Running. Last May I'd smoked for about six years and I was up to a pack a day. When I started it sucked, and as time progressed I smoked less and less. Eventually I reached a point where I stopped altogether. A few months in I got drunk and smoked a couple at a party; those two cigarettes made the next day or so's runs incredibly challenging where they should have been easy. Now I have to be incredibly blasted to grab one, and usually it's no more than a toke at that."I started chewing."Chantix and some life events, but even when I did smoke, I never smoked during my workday or had to have one right when waking up.  So, I consider myself a light smoker.

I took the Chantix, which you can start taking and smoke while you are taking it.  After about day 3, I noticed I was not feeling that sense of relief of ""getting the fix"" from smoking I had before.  But I was still smoking, so psychologically, I didn't feel deprived.  Right during that period, my very good friend died suddenly of a heart attack at age 25.  I couldn't go back and restart the Chantix because I think there was a schedule to it and I had paid, at that time, a lot of money for the Chantix.  I took my friend's death as motivation to get healthier because if he died at that young age, my continuing to smoke was not going to improve my longevity. I had also just started work in a nursing home about a month before it and seeing folks on the ventilator unit was actually eye opening for me.  Finally, my sister quit smoking about 2 months before me, cold turkey, so I felt very competitive that I would fail and she would succeed and that wasn't acceptable to me.

The greatest motivator was my first actual day of quitting smoking, I came home from work and walked into my downstairs apt and there was water EVERYWHERE.  A pipe had burst in the upstairs apartment and ran all day long, and EVERYTHING was wet and ruined.  It was such an obvious challenge to me to have so much bad shit go down at this particular time, that I thought to myself, ""if this is the best temptation has for me, it's going to have to do better, because I'm not failing or turning back now"".  And I didn't.  Any excuse afterward paled in comparison, so I just pushed through and after a little while I had no problem at all.  Rarely do I think about it now, and it'll be 5 years in March.

I will warn you, if you do use Chantix, I experienced feelings of rage I had never experienced.  I really felt quite unglued and even took medication (Xanax) to help with this per my doctor.  I think it's something that happens with the Chantix, but it might be the quitting smoking.  Just a friendly warning.  

Hope my story helps! You can do this.  It's not as bad as you think.  As a health care worker, I understand what you mean.  My work has strict ""you can only smoke when you leave the grounds and you can only leave the grounds during your lunch"" policies that it's very difficult to smoke, but prior to that it is the only way you get a break.  Maybe find ways of taking walks and get used to not smoking at work before you actually quit?  Good luck!!"Stopped drinking first. Then stopped hanging out at places where I would smoke. Started smoking more weed. Stopped hanging out with other people that smoked. Eventually quit. "Smoked for 9 years.  I had wanted to quit smoking for a long time but not bad enough to actually do it.  I had just come out of a bad relationship and decided that I wanted something better for myself next time.  Not that smokers are bad, I just wanted a better, healthier life for myself in all respects.  I also figured that I would open myself up to a wider variety of future dates if I was a non-smoker.  I used nicotine patches and quit but the main reason it worked is that I decided that I was actually done.  I didn't say, ""let's see if this works"", I was committed to it working.  It wasn't easy, it was actually the hardest thing I've ever done and it's something I'm very proud of now.  I still had cravings 2 years after I quit but I stuck with it.

Turns out, I did meet someone shortly after I quit.  We dated for about a year and a half before I asked her to marry me.  This year will be our 10th anniversary.  Never would have happened if I was still smoking. 

""I quit back in 2001 after having tried and failed several times before. The previous times I tried, I would stop for a few days/weeks, but I really wanted a cigarette and after days/weeks of personal torture, I would end up convincing myself to have just one, which led me right back into it.
The final time I quit, I was able to do so because I was mental ""done with it."" I was turned off by it and it was easy.
Why? I had gone to the doctor for a physical and I actually remember smoking weed & cigarettes in the parking lot before my visit! I blew into some kind of lung machine to test my lungs and the doctor said I had the lungs of an old man, or something to that effect. Now, I think most of that was due to smoking a joint and a cigarette on the way in to the office. But it was enough for me to draw the line and end it that day. (BTW, I was 25 at the time.)
Again, I was mentally DONE with smoking. And since I was so dead set on quitting, it was easy! Cold turkey! Never went back.
So maybe go and get your lungs tested! Worked for me!""Finally realized it did not and never did make me look cool and i didn't want to be an old wrinkly, yellow toothed bastard"Sunflower seeds and making young criminals dig holes in the desert for my boss."I quit smoking after about 8 years when I moved out of the friendzone with who is now my wife.  She wouldn't date anyone who smoked, and I was already thinking about quitting.  I was determined after many, many years of wanting to date her, and the timing being right, that I had a chance to be with her.
It was quite easy in the beginning, but after a week or so I was running to the store to get some patches.  I relied on them for about a month or two before getting off nicotine for good.
I couldn't get over how much better I felt overall, and how well I could smell after quitting (and obviously I saved a shit ton of money).  

Knowing what I know now, I feel utter contempt for our society for having cigarettes readily available to children and it being the socially ""cool"" thing to do, while banning weed as a Schedule I drug.  It's just bullshit.""I had a real bad cough/cold, with some bad wheezing that went on for a month.

I finally went to the doctor, and he prescribed me some anti-biotics. When the cough went away, I noticed I was still wheezing pretty badly, and would wake up having a hard time breathing.

I went back to the doctors and they did some breathing tests and other diagnostics, and told me I was in the pre-stages of COPD/emphysema. I was prescribed an albuterol inhaler and sent on my way. This was when I was 25.

I decided that I liked breathing more than smoking, and quit.  It took my three tries, before I successfully quit. 

I tried to stop cold turkey the first attempt. Failed miserably.

Then I tried the patch, and that just wasn't cutting it. I would find myself with a patch on one arm and a cigarette in the hand.

Then I tried the gum, and that worked for me.

I've been smoke free since (6+ years). "Triple bypass heart surgery. "I quit cold turkey. Was tough at first but after a while things got better. The trick is total abstinence, if you ever smoke again, you'll be back on it""Psychedelic drugs. Seriously. 

Addiction is a neurochemical thing as much as it is a psychological one. Psychedelic drugs are being tested as proven therapies for everything from addiction to depression. Tripping is an effective way of addressing both chemical and psychological aspects at the same time. I can attest to their incredible efficacy in both these realms. 

Many smokers suffer from depression, and smoking intensifies rumination and low mood. Smoking forces you to swallow emotions. There is always an underlying psychological cause for smoking. It's a symptom of some deeper issues. Was for me anyway. 

Cigs constantly flood your brain with chemicals that are deleariating. Smoking makes you think poorly. Changing those patterns of thinking via tripping can be an extremely effective way of breaking out of addictive patterns of all sorts. 

Judicious cannabis use also helped me transition away from cigs. My other therapy endeavors also gave me the tools to use psychedelics effectively to treat my cig addiction. It's not a magic bullet, tripping for therapy is an acquired skill. 

After a few trips and learning how to do it therapeutically, I broke through and haven't had a cig or drink of alcohol--or even desired either of these things--for more than a year. I wasn't an alcoholic by any means, but that came with it: a simple loss of desire to drink. Interesting, no?

This kind of therapy is not for everybody, though. Not yet anyway. pm me if interested in hearing more. 

P.S. I tried everything, talk therapy, hypnotherapy, gum, patches, e-cigs, nothing helped my depression or smoking. It was a last-ditch thing, but investigating psychedelic therapy saved my life. 

TLDR: Drugs aren't that bad, mkay. Mushrooms are your friend, mkay. Cigs are horrifying, mkay. ""i quit due to the e-cigarette, found out about them here on reddit. /r/electronic_cigarette "Hang out with non-smokers."I tried quitting way more times then I care to admit. But for me it was a health related scare. After 9 years of active duty as a volunteer fire fighter my physical showed I had high blood pressure, thus making me unfit for active duty. For me it was a decision between something I loved and the friendships I have earned over the years being a volley or that sweet sweet taste of Marlboro in the morning. Granted I love my morning smoke, and midday smoke, and my anytime I got in my car smoke or basically when ever I felt like one would taste good. I was a pack a day smoker, but after not smoking for about a month I started to take a long hard look at the people in my office that smoked. The smell was something I had no idea I smelt like on a regular basis. I found my self walking behind smokers feeling disgusted with the way they smelt. Now I'm sure this doesn't help you really, but its just a perspective as to why some people are able to quit. I don't truthfully consider my self not a smoker, I have only made it 7 months so far with no cigarette, but at this point, I look at even one cigarette as if I were to smoke it then I would be giving up 7 months of resisting that urge. I quit cold turkey, and the only thing I can suggest is try setting a bench mark, say ""for the next month  I will not smoke a cig"". Try not looking at it as a battle for the rest of your life but more of a day by day battle. The fact that you are even asking for advice shows that you really would like to take a step away from smoking so you should have that voice inside of you that can just say ""not today"". 
Again, I'm sure this doesn't help much, but good luck. "Late to the party but this hits home. I tried to quit several times and never did. Until my dad had a heart attack. I quit cold turkey that day. That was 6 years ago."I quit mid cig, threw it away and never smoked again. Before that I was a smoker for 10 years.  Never had a craving, I been with out a cig for over 3 years now.""Mom died of cancer, quit on her next birthday.""Drink lots of water. Try to get into an exercise routine. 

Learn how your body and its cravings work. One of the best things I realized was that the average cigarette craving only lasted 1 minute, if that. So when I really wanted a cigarette I would tell myself that if I *still* really wanted on after a minute had passed, I could. The minute would go by and suddenly the craving was way more manageable. 

Drink lots of water. Yes I've said that twice. Another trick was that if I made it until midnight and I was still up I could have one. That was good for horrible stress filled days because all day I'd think ""Oh man I get to have a cigarette tonight"" and then at midnight it just wouldn't seem as important.

Also it's important to acknowledge that you are not just giving up the physical addiction to nicotine, for a lot of smoker the entire routine has become a part of their lives. At had met a lot of my friends on cigarette breaks. I had met two of my girlfriends on cigarette breaks. They were a part of my life. It was a bit of a mind-fuck to inhabit my life without them at first.

And drink a lot of water."fight it for 2 weeks after that it gets easier.I just stopped buying them. After a while I felt bad being a bum and stopped smoking. Wasn't easy but I haven't habitually smoked for 4 years now. I have had a few here and there but I haven't gotten back into the habit. The urge to have a cigarette will go away if you have a cigarette or if you don't have a cigarette. "I've been taking champix for almost 5 weeks,haven't had a cigarette for 3 weeks now""I was about to be married, and I used Blue ecigs as a transitional out of smoking. It worked. I got tired of sucking on a plastic battery-operated apperatus (as if it's any stupider than rolled up leaves) and I stopped and I've been quit for 16 months.""Vapor 4 Life DOT COM - 3.5 years from a real cig and let me tell ya, vaping is now a choice, I either choose to do it or not...like choosing to have a beer on a Wednesday night or not...like choosing to grab a bag of doritos or not with my lunch...it is your choice, no longer a habit

I agree with other posters...buy a good expensive kit, start high on your nicotine level with your ejuice, buy a good flavor that you like (trial and error by yourself here) and step down gradually

(never buy pink cartos - NEVER - even when your drunk mind thinks it is a good idea - NEVER)""I quit together with my brother, and even though he started again after two days, he supported me a lot. Whenever I felt the need for a smoke, I would call him and tell him, and it would help.
Another trick I used was to tell people that I wanted a smoke whenever I felt the need to smoke. See, the difference is that I can control wants, but needs remain. So by telling myself it was a 'want' over and over, I started believing it myself, and I didn't have to smoke.

My dad just got a bad case of the flu, was bedridden and unable to smoke for a week, and never started again.

What also helps is to list all the positive sides to smoking, so you know what you'll be missing. Then, make plans how to alleviate missing these things.
For me, the following things were positive sides that I would miss.
Breaking the ice in any social interaction. You have something in common with other smokers, and this automatically functions as a conversation starter. I alleviated this by still hanging out in the smoking spots when people would smoke. It turns out that just being together with them was enough to break the ice.
Stress relieving. The act of smoking that cigarette every hour gave me a moment of quiet contemplation. It relaxed me a lot. I dealt with this by realizing that I really had very little stress in my life.
These two were really big things for me. There were other sides, but those were minor or not easily planned though.""I was driving to work the morning after a raging party. At this party a few friends and I smoked three packs over the course of the night so naturally I felt pretty disgusting. It felt like ""the day"", and I just so happened to have some nic gum in my car from the last attempt. Went three days on that, then cold turkey. I occasionally still have a few with friends when drinking, but I went without a single one for three years. It took eight trys to get it right, so don't be discouraged if you fail!"Actually wanting to quit is what did it for me."I quit smoking using Chantix, but my reason was my son being born. I never wanted him to associate that stench to me, or see me doing it. The odds of your child smoking are greatly increased if you smoke. So I went to the Dr and asked for help because every time I had tried to quit Cold Turkey in the past failed.""I quit smoking four years ago.  I just decided that it was time to stop, and I quit cold turkey.

I still have cravings.  Honestly, if there were no long-term consequences I would start smoking again.  If I were diagnosed with a terminal illness, or a planet-destroying asteroid was found to be heading towards earth, my first stop would be at a gas station to pick up a carton of Camels.
""While working as an xray tech , an older patient came into the radiology suite and was happy she quit smoking after many years. I remember her being so proud of herself after smoking most of her adult life. Her doctor wanted to play it safe an ordered an xray. After I took the xray , I saw what looked like tumors in her lungs , and there was a lot. That's when I decided to quit, and I tell every patient that is a smoker that comes in about it. ""E-Cigs was may life savior, when they first came out I tried them and they weren't as advanced as they are now, so I ended up going back to smoking analogs. A few years later I found out about ""ego's"" and ""mods"" which are more advanced then the older ""cig-a-likes"" once I moved to an Ego style E-Cig i never looked back. I upgraded to a mod and that stabilized the fact that I would never touch a cigarette again. If it hadn't been for the advancement of the vaporizers, I'd still be smoking cigarettes. ""I told my roommate I was thinking about buying an e-cig, but it was to costly.

She came home with one a few weeks later, and I haven't smoked a regular cigarette since. I even stopped using my e-cig. ""Haven't seen much love for the patch in these comments. Do they even sell them anymore? That really worked for me. However, you're never really over your nicotine addiction; when you quit the world loses a little color and it never comes back, even years later. After years of going crazy every time I smelled other people smoking, I picked up ecigs and I am so much happier now. I'm not even tempted to try analogs again.""This will make you laugh, When the smoking ban was announced in Ireland a number of years back I decided it was time to quit (after nearly a decade of heavy drug abuse too, stopped the drugs 2 years beforehand, just couldn't kick the smokes), wasn't quite keen on smoking outside in the Irish weather. So a few weeks before the ban came in I bit the bullet and decided to quit (probably my 4th attempt); knowing my past record I went straight on the patches, which turned out to be REALLY strong, so I saved them, I'd get maybe 3 days out of one before I needed another. So one Friday we were going out for a few pints, went through the usual routine, eat dinner, quick shower, fresh clothes and a fresh patch. Out we went; I sat and drank my beer at ease and in comfort, in full knowledge I wouldn't be smoking that night. Later that night/following morning when we got home I said to my girlfriend-  ""these patches are great! you should try them, I wasn't craving at all tonight.""

I took off my shirt getting ready for bed and would you believe it - I'd forgotten to put the patch on that evening. 

That was it for me, never smoked again, never used a patch again. 

Lesson: it's all in your head. ""My boyfriend told me he just couldn't be attracted to me when I smelled like smoke. That was the real kicker. I finally had a tangible reason. Sure, the health risks SHOULD be a huge reason. They were, but it all really comes down to that. Haven't smoked in roughly six months. I don't miss it. (: ""This is buried under 10k comments and probably already mentioned a ton of times but:

You have to actually WANT to. If you don't want to quit, you may end up bouncing right back. When I was trying to quit I bounced back so many times because I just didn't want to quit. I ended up finally being able to do it, but if you actually want to do it your will power is much stronger. 

I agree, cold turkey is the way to go. After you get past two days you think ""I've gone this far, if I break it I am starting through the horrible withdraw from scratch."""Switch to weed."Hell yes. I've found I want a cig much more when I'm out of greens.

Also, remembering how, before smoking, all the rituals you get into - lighting up when you get in the car, finish a big meal, have a shit, etc - wasn't all that different before cigs. Breaking those rituals goes a long way.""Somehow, inexplicably, I started  having headaches every time I smoked. It wasn't good anymore, no pleasure at all. 

Friend of mine used to smoke three packs of malboro everyday (here in Brazil, cigars are really cheap, like $3 dollars per pack). Two days ago, I found out that she got pregnant and since than, she also stopped. Oh yeah, she got a little bit crazy.""I quit when I moved.  All of my old friends were smokers, and I tried to quit like 4 times before and always started up again because it was never too far away from my life.  It's way eaier to quit when you change the scenery- you don't have to deal so much with quelling all of those smoking urges that are cued by familiar places and memories of smoking.

I also used alcohol to get through the first week.  Now I'm at almost 5 years.""Running. The feeling in your lungs after a long run is just as addicting as taking a drag. Getting over the ritual smoking times (breaks, car rides, walking anywhere) was really tough, but when you feel the difference in your lungs, you eventually won't want to go back. ""I used Blu E-Cigs I started those and smoke real smokes until I ran out then I just stuck to the Blu. I don't even smoke them every day or week for that matter, I do take them with me if I go some where to drink just as security. It will be a year for me in a week. You are going to have to change your routine, if you only get a break to light up, then go walk the stairs or something instead. But the Blu was more like a real one in their shape and size and helped with the habbit more for me, than those big vapor wands. "Took some mushrooms and thought about it real hard. Haven't bought a pack in over a year. "Allen Carr's ""Easy Way To Quit Smoking"" worked for me. Don't be a slave. 

"Winter"Not identifying as a smoker.

I didn't start smoking until I was 20 years old. I'll spare you the long story, but it wasn't something I ever wanted to do. I already knew how stupid it was, but it was the sole comfort to me in the darkest time in my life (actually just the point in my life when my skills at dealing with tragedy were the least capable of handling the amount I was enduring. I've had worse days since then, but I am much more well-equipped now).

However, I just had the hardest fucking time quitting smoking.

More than a decade after I started, I had a gene test done that returned information I was 0% surprised by. I basically had the ""over smoking gene"" which causes people that do smoke to smoke a SHIT TON.

http://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/news/20100426/smoking-genes-indentified

But yeah, never identifying as a ""smoker,"" allowed me to know that I was in control of my behavior, even if my brain chemistry itself was my enemy.

I isolated myself from people (especially smokers) for about a month. Kept myself busy with things (mostly exercise), and drank lots of of Earl Grey tea (appetite suppressant and it helps sate the oral fixation).

It's not easy. Good luck!""I'm smoking free for 2 years and one day. the reason I'm so specific, is that what worked for me was to ritualize the reduction in my consuption. For months, I told myself that I had to quit. I started by going back to the gym where I practice kick boxing, knowing that cigarette would be a brake in my progress. Then, I slowly started to force myself to wait some specific events before smoking. first it was ""not until I had breakfast and I'm on my way  to work"", then in the day it could be ""not before I trained"", and the cigarette I was craving for was absolutely disgusting. I then had to wait an hour or so after the training to actually be able to smoke. So, by setting a few objectives without pressure and blaming myself if I didn't succeed, I slowly reduced my consumption to 4-5 cigarettes a day, but I could still smoke a whole pack within a night of drinking. Then, I stumbled upon an e-cigarette on sale, and bought it just in case, but chose the nicotin-free version. 

Then someday, I went to a concert I had been expecting for a long time, partied really hard, and lost my pack of cigarettes. So for that sunday everywhere I could get cigs was closed, so I used the e-cigarette. Then I felt it was time to give quitting a try. I used the e-cigarette for a few weeks, and progressively quit everything. 

"Protank 2 with cotton wick. "I have no idea. I tried quitting a few times and it never stuck. One day I lit up and it just tasted gross to me, made my head spin and stomach turn, and I was like 
""I'm done with this.""

Only hard moments in the last 3 years of not smoking has been the 10 min break between classes or at work, as the op noted, where it seems like the only way to get a break is to smoke. Also, bars. I had to train myself not to hold a beer the way would have if there was a cig between my fingers. 

""What finally worked for me was swapping out smoking for intense exercise. I made the exercising itself a compulsion, and an important one at that! Therefor I had no choice but to stay away from cigs otherwise I and my workouts would suffer. That was about 13 months ago and now I'm cigarette free and in the best shape of my life...not to mention that I feel great all day from the endorphins released during my morning workouts. The natural high has a kick to it""It's a drug! You need to back off very slowly if you want to ease the withdrawal symptoms. Draw up a plan that is very gradual and then follow it. You might, for example, get down to 1/2 cigarette, twice a day, after several weeks of cutting back. Quitting after that would not be so difficult.""You have to REALLY WANT to quit.  Not half-quit, or know you should quit, but really want to quit--or else you won't.

I had tried to quit about 20 times.  Each time I ""quit,"" I was successful for weeks or even months at a time, but then I would ""let myself just have one"" which would happen every day, then two times a day, etc.  

I think it was annoyance with myself for not quitting.  Then there was the night where my supportive friend saw me smoking after several weeks of having quit (again) and she lovingly, but mockingly, said to me, in the perfect tone, ""Oh!  You hate your body!""""I did quit, now after reading this thread, I want one...so bad. ""I changed jobs (not for the purpose of quitting, I had been laid off), and started the new job as if I were a non-smoker. This way, nobody invited me on ""smoke breaks"", and I hadn't developed a clique of smoker friends. I also used the patch for the first week or so, just so I didn't go rage-y on anybody. Worked perfectly! Funny side note though, while I've never had the urge to back, when I have dreams I'm often smoking in them. Not as the focus of the dream, just as if it were part of my routine.""There's a few mental tricks I used:

- Break one habit at a time. Always smoke after meals? Always smoke in the car? Always take breaks at work? Take those out 1 by 1 and you'll be surprised when you no longer even think of them during those times.

- Quitting smoking is a first world problem, through and through. No matter how bad you work up the cravings to be in your mind, it's still just something you want, can (and should) do without, and there are literally billions of people in the world who would take that as a problem to have. People are starving but I really wish I had a cig after that gluttonous meal. Puts things in perspective.

- If you're into meditation and you're getting a craving, stop, concentrate, and picture your brain and neuronal synapses. Picture dopamine (pleasure neurotransmitter heavily responsible for nicotine addiction) flooding your brain, giving yourself a warm and relaxed feeling of peace. Do this until the craving passes.

- Don't drink around smokers. This one's not a trick as much as it is obvious."Asked this exact question yesterday and received 3 up votes...."The best advice I can give you is to quit cold turkey when you have a big change in your life, that way quitting isn't foremost in your mind. I smoked for 8 years and quit cold turkey when I moved in with my non-smoker SO. I still had 2 unopened packs in my purse for a month after, gave 'em to some dude who randomly asked me for a smoke one day. I had changed cities and was about to start a new job as well, had a week off of work and just cleaned the shit out of everything, went for walks/drives to figure out my new area, kept myself busy. That was over 5 years ago, haven't had a cigarette since! ""I was diagnosed with tuberculosis 5 years ago (which wasn't caused specifically by smoking, the doctors said). It was a mild case, standard treatment, in 6 months i was completely healthy. What made me quit was seeing other people dying while i was in hospital. Kinda rough way to quit, but i'm glad i did.""Just quit. If you hate them enough, you'll quit. I bought my last packet for a New Years party (I had already decided to quit at some point in the bear future, happened to co-incide with New Years!), ended up not smoking one until 1:30am, then proceeded to give a bunch away while chain smoking 2-3 at a time. I was determined to be rid of the pack by the time I was going home. Haven't smoked since, still want one sometimes, but purely out of habit and not craving. 

Don't replace them with the 'leccy ones, the patches, the gum, they don't work. If you really want to quit, just do it and stop pretending to. 

To put some context on this, last year I was up to 5 packs a week at least, sometimes up to 8 a week. So not a social smoker. "I found that patches kept the nicotine craving down and ordinary gum chewed often gave my mouth something to do. Finally succeeded on my ?th attempt. 10 years later I still have to fight the urge to buy- especially when I see an anti- smoking advert- they really look good."Nothing works unless you really do want to quit.  As long as you still want to smoke you, will - no matter what magic measures you take in the way of e-cigs, gum, hypnotism, etc.  but I did have something push me over the edge (now 2-1/2 years into not smoking).  Oh I still think about it sometimes.  But I know I want to be a non-smoker.  It's a choice and you have to want it.  But there are motivators.  Try watching someone you know, with cancer, get their lungs suctioned out...seeing and hearing that nasty crap collected in that container...trust me, that will do it.""I'm not a smoker, but my grandfather was.

He decided to stop smoking and wrote the date on a carton of cigarettes that he carried around in his shirt pocket.

When he would have the urge to light up, he would take out the carton and look at the date.

At first it was ""It's only been a couple days. I have more willpower than that.""

Eventually it turned in to ""It's been such a long time, it would be a shame to go back now.""

Never smoked again."Sunflower seeds. Whenever you get a craving start eating salted sunflower seeds. I quit about 4 years ago this way. "Non-smokers are people that do not smoke.

If you want to be considered a non-smoker, do not smoke. That simple.

I had quit 3 times, once for over 2 years. The 4th time was in 1990.

I became a non-smoker by NOT FUCKING SMOKING. It was that simple.

Pure force-of-will, mind-over-matter. Not patches, no lozenges, no hypnotism, no acupuncture, no bullshit. 

Make the decision, live the decision.""I started by cutting down. I was never a heavy smoker but in the last year I went from about 15 a day down to five a day, then for the last three months I was on one or two a day, just saving it until I really wanted one rather than smoking out of habit. Then one day I woke up and just knew that was the day I would stop completely. This was eleven years ago and I haven't smoked tobacco since. I didn't even mind still being around people who were smoking when I was in that stopping phase (although I was never ""stopping"", I just stopped - ""there is no try, do or do not""), because I knew I was never gonna smoke again so the temptation wasn't even there. I know that sounds arrogant, but you have to be that certain about it for it to work - nicotine is a powerful drug. Maybe start off by just saying no to the first cigarette of the day...
 
Just over a year later I tried a joint made with tobacco and I couldn't smoke it. I somehow had psychological block there that just made it feel like someone trying to push their fist down my throat so I couldn't physically inhale, which I thought was really impressive.


Chugging a glass of very cold water or eating a piece of fruit helped me get over the immediate cravings and will-power kept me on that track. Another thing I found helpful was thinking about what smoking actually did for me. Once you realise that it only serves itself, in-so-far-as the stress it relieves is the stress of not having a cigarette, and that it doesn't have any actual benefits (unless you think that wearing clothes that smell like a stale ashtray is a benefit), it's just a matter of following that logic through with your actions, but you have to be determined and know deep down that you are going to stop. Also, I didn't use patches or gum because I wanted to break the addiction entirely, and without paying stupid amounts of money for substitute nicotine carriers.""Cold turkey. But my motivation was sleep apnea, and inability to afford them.""I know this is not going to be a popular answer, but I've quit successfully twice. I know what you're going to say, if I went back the first time wasn't successful. But it was. Quit for years, went back on purpose. Anyway. Both times it's been by gradually tapering off over about a month. First, not smoking in the car. Then not smoking after meals. then on breaks. Then after movies. Last, after sex. Eventually you get to the point where you look forward to having one, and about halfway through you're like ""wow this is gross why am I even doing it?"" You notice the stink more. The last one was so undramatic, just ""meh, sick of this."" and done.

Allen Carr's Easyway to Quit Smoking.  Which I discovered thanks to [r/stopsmoking](http://reddit.com/r/stopsmoking)


Sorry, it's from that book I read that made it completely effortless for my wife and I to become non-smokers.   It has been a non-issue since the day we stopped.    No, cravings, no longings, no thoughts about smoking.  Since we stopped that day, I have gone weeks (stopped smoking a little over 6 months ago) w/o even thinking about smoking.  At first I was totally blown away. I would stop and thinking to myself. 'OMG, I have totally forgotten to make sure to remind myself to not think about not being able to have a cigarette.

By FAR, ONE of the easiest things I have done to better my life.  (Was so easy I decided to go on a  diet the next month, lost over 57 lbs in 3mo's but that was no picnic believe you me.)

edit: Guess I should add that there were no meds, no tricks, no gimmicks, no mantras, no praying no meditating, no bending, no twisting, no focusing involved.  Nothing at all. After reading the book, hell, half way through it, I just did not want them anymore.  No reason to smoke.  Not one, single,. solitary valid reason to be a smoker.

No, it was not cold turkey,  cold turkey implies(majority of the time) you need to have will power to not have a cigarette after you make the choice to stop smoking.  That was not the case with me, there was nothing that required me to  have willpower for. There was no craving, no aching or need to have a cigarette after I stopped.""Chantix, smoked for a lil over 10 years.  Started chantix, smoked for 1 week then on Monday of the 2nd I stopped.. that was almost 3 years ago and haven't smoked since.

Really you have to WANT to quit and I mean really want to.  What the Chantix does is keep you from physically feeling withdrawal. Rest is up to your mental attitude to stay clean.  ""Crazy late but I'll share my story. I simply stopped cold turkey.

I'm 23 now, smoke since I was like 17. At 19 I was serious smoker, no filter almost 1 and a half pack a day. Whatever.

Almost a year ago I went on a trip with school. I finished my pack during the trip there so I decided to buy a new one. 

All was well when I started to smoke but for some reason my heart started to beat faster. I just thought nothing of it believing it will pass by soon. I was like that for good 2 minutes started to hyperventilate, something that has never happened to me so I didn't know what to do. I didn't smoke for a couple of hours, next time I lighted up another cigarette at a party the same thing started to happen. 

So I stopped threw away the pack and went to my room to rest.

Very rarely I crave in and have one but I never really finish it. I dedicate myself on other things that way I don't think about having a smoke.

The hyperventilation could had been caused by other things and not the cigarette but it helped me get scared and just stop.""It was distracting me from my work so I just decided to quit, this was last year on november 18th and now I feel a lot better. There used to be a nagging feeling in my head telling me to smoke tobacco but now that feeling is replaced with a cool sense of freshness and being able to do whatever I want with the time otherwise spent on smoking tobacco. "Cold turkey is best. I did it on a road trip to South Carolina. I was pissed for a while but got over it"I started smoking just to get the break.

1.  I quit cold turkey one day just b/c I was sick of it.  The smell.  The cost.  All of it.

2.  You need to replace the habit of activity.  Smoking a cig is an activity you take to get away from your work, for your break.  That need to do something for that break / time is a big driving that wears at ya...

Replace it with something else, go take your break in your car and listen to music, go get a slushie, go for a walk real fast.

I subbed it for a snack break for carrots...lost weight too."E-Cigs "Laziness, pure unadulterated laziness. I got sent to a new duty station and everyone in my new company were super health nuts and I was the only smoker. There was only one designated smoking area about 600 yards away from where I worked. I wasn't willing to walk 600 yards both ways to go stand alone and freeze my ass off, just to smoke."Just wanted to say that the average number of times it takes people to quit is 7 so keep trying!! "I was up to two packs a day in college.  Drinking and Gaming I'd light one off the end of the last.  I decided to Immediately cut that in half.  1 pack a day for a month, then half that.  1 half pack a day for a month; on and on till I got to 1 smoke a day. To supplement the oral I'd chew on gum and plastic straws or toothpicks almost constantly. When I got to 1 I'd smoke half a cigarette in the morning and half when I needed it (the second half tastes awful when first lit) or before I went to bed and I did that for a year.  Then I met my wife and had a REASON to quit and was able to:). I sometimes relapse due to stress or smoke cigars but never more than a few in a week with over 6 months in between or on special occasions.  Its been over 5 years and if I've smoked 4 packs total in that time, I'd be surprised.  Plus I had one smoke total in the 10 months since we found we're pregnant and that was a congrats smoke:). Great luck to all who endeavor to quit.""I smoked from 12 years old till i was 18. Quit ON my 18 birthday after i bought my first pack of legal cigs. Took one out and handed the pack to my friend and told him its his and im done. Havn't looked back sense. 

Thing for me was i got totally smashed and the next day i felt like total shit and didn't even want a cig. The day after that i made sure to keep busy and find something productive to do. Whenever i had a craving i reminded myself that i couldn't do anything while i was smoking. Sports mainly football and mma was huge for me so i really wanted to quit for them. They third day was make it or break it for me. I knew if i made it past the three day hump then i would be good. Again, just made sure to keep busy and my mind was off of it. 

I am now 24 and havn't touched a cigarette sense.""About 9 years ago my grandfather gave himself a nice birthday present: quit smoking, he sat on his bed on the morning of his 75th birthday and smoke the last one. He told us that it was not difficult, he just quit after a whole lifetime as a smoker... 

He told me a couple of times that there was no need of a special methods, you only have to decide it, and that should be the way to go on everything on your life. 

Last august my grandpa passed away, a cause of an accident... something completely different of any kind of decease. He was a very healthy and strong man. And after decades of smoking, the decision of that birthday morning allowed him to not have any cigar-related illness. 

I am 27, I started smoking at about 19 y/o. About 2 or 3 cigars a day.   
Last December 12th on the morning of  his birthday, I went to the cemetery, smoked my last cigar, and since then I haven't had a cigar. (just a bit of a hookah on a party a couple of weeks ago). 

I hope I can maintain this decision for the rest of my life. 

I guess that the only one thing that can make you change a bad habit is a conscious decision. Not hope that a special method can change you.

""The day I found out my wife was pregnant, was the day I quit. Before that I was simply too selfish. I knew I needed the ultimate motivation to quit and it worked. That along with ecigs. I started on disposables and worked my way up and now have a fun hobby along with an absolute sure way to quit. I knew a patch or something like chantix would never work for me. Ecigs have saved me. ""I am going on 3 weeks without having any tobacco. Honestly, most of it is mental. I realized that I truly have no reason to smoke. I don't need them. Basically, they are pointless. This realization coupled with the will power to not want to smoke is what has really helped me stay off the cigs. Also, I have a friend that is quitting as well, and whenever I feel like a ""want"" a cig, I text him and he supports me not to smoke one. It is nice to have a friend to kind of lean on for support and strength.

You can do it! Believe in yourself and realize there is nothing beneficial about smoking.""Here is how I did it.

Phase 1: Pace reduction

Buy a can of Drum or some similar ""roll your own"" tobacco along with papers a roller and some filter plugs.  Rolling your own forces you to slow down a little and that's a good start.  

Phase 2: Intake reduction

After a couple of weeks, use 2 filter plugs instead of just one in each of your cigs.  This will reduce the amount of tobacco and thus shorten the smoke session a little.  You are cleaning up your lungs little by little, you are also turning down the volume on your addiction to Nicotine.

Phase 3: Reduce to zero.

Roll some cigs in the morning and say to yourself that those will be your morning cigs, once they are gone you have to wait until the afternoon to smoke again.  Same for afternoon and evening, just roll enough for that time period and stick to it.  Whenever you feel ready, reduce the number of cigs you are rolling up for each period.  Week by week you can reduce it down to only a few or a couple for each period, morning, afternoon and evening.

Now you can quit, because now you have control and your nicotine addiction has been thinned out.  Just stop buying the tobacco and stuff and never look back.

p.s.: you will fall off the wagon a few times, we all do especially when out drinking with friends.  Don't worry about it.  Just pickup again where you left off the next day, its cool you can do it.""Chantix. I started smoking at 14, and kept it up for 19 years. I could feel how out of shape I was; heavy breathing after minimal activity, etc.. That's what made me want to quit.
So I quit with Chantix. It made me sick, in the mornings, for most of the time I was taking it. It was like a really queasy feeling in the gut. Now, over 3 years without a cigarette, I still get that sick feeling when I smell one.
Recently I was waiting in a notoriously slow drive-thru, behind a car, and the driver of the car behind me was smoking a cigarette. Once I got a whiff of it, plus the feeling of being trapped there in the drive-thru with the smoke, I totally opened the door and vomited right there. It didn't help. I had to stop the car and vomit again on the way home too.....
One more: So I was at my doctor's (non-smoker) office waiting for my turn. The patient leaves, and the doctor Febrezes the exam room before I come in. I ask about it and the doc says its because the previous patient is a smoker. So I ask if she sprayed down the room when I leave, and she says that she used to before I quit smoking.
I can't really stand the idea that, even if some people are nice to my face, they might be secretly disgusted and have to fix their own space after my presence."Every winter like clockwork I would get deathly sick for like a week and couldn't touch a cigarette (mainly because I could hardly breathe as it was). By the time I got better I was pretty much over any craving etc but would always go back because I enjoyed it. Once I was ready to kick it I just waited to get sick again and haven't touched one since. I grew some pot and started smoking that instead"Get a tissue, inhale some smoke, blow it through the tissue. Look at what is left on the tissue, visualise it inside your lungs but much worse. Visualise all the carcinogenic tar build up that sits there potentially for a year or two even after you quit.

About a month ago I read a post somewhere (Sorry I can't quote the source) but it said something along the lines of...

>Unless you have a real reason to quit, you'll really struggle, and in fact the stress of not being able to quit will possibly cause you to smoke more. I want you to smoke from now for 3 months, guilt free. When you have a cigarette, remove all thoughts of quitting from your mind, and enjoy it. Enjoy every last bit of it. 

And I did just that, for a whole month. I forgot about quitting... Kind of. The thing was, now I knew I had a 'free pass' guilty free to not smoke for 3 months, I did take more smoke breaks, I did bring more out with me than when I was 'cutting down' or quitting. But I also enjoyed them a lot less. I don't know... I made it that one month into the 3 months before I literally hated every last breath of a cigarette and so I stopped. Yesterday I managed my first day at work without a cigarette in 2 years, its been my longest quit attempt at 5 days and I have absolutely no intention of caving in.

So how? This isn't a proven success attempt yet, albeit my longest, but try not quitting, try just enjoying them as many of them as you like, for 3 months. See how long you last. If you keep on quitting and failing, which I found very upsetting, you really have nothing to lose!

Good luck!""READ ME: Start working out. Seriously. Just go running or do a stairmaster for 20 minutes a day. It will become painfully (literally) clear that smoking is harming you.



"My grandmother quit cold turkey and started gnawing licorice roots. And I quit and replaced it with Swedish snuff (snus) "I smoked a pack a day for 27 years. I have now been smoke free for almost 8 years. Needed to quit to have surgery, but it was elective surgery so it was still my choice to have to do it. I tried Wellbutrin but that made me sick so I had to do it cold turkey. I started looking for tips and tricks to help me through it and here are the ones that worked: 

1. A nicotine craving only lasts for 3 minutes. So all I had to do was get through 3 minutes without smoking. Easy peasy eh?
2. Tapering off does not work and did not help me at all. In fact it made it worse as I was getting stressed and anxious about it.
3. I carried a pack of cigarettes with me for about a month after smoking my last one. It was all about the psychological fact that should I choose to have one, I could.
4.  I never said to myself I was quitting forever because those thoughts were the path to an anxiety attack about quitting. I would tell myself I'm not having *this* cigarette.
5. Knowing that the coughing and hacking up a lung were normal and would go away on their own. Knowing the timings of things (ie when the nicotine was completely out of my body, when my breathing should improve, etc) was very helpful as it gave me something to look forward to. Btw, any kind of replacement therapy (gum, patch, e-cig) only prolongs the process. You have to get over the nicotine addiction in order to quit.
6. Picking a date in advance of when I was quitting and telling only a few people that could be counted on to help talk me down if needed. 
7. Try to get rid of as many triggers as you can beforehand. I smoked only outside for a long time so that I could stop the cravings from being on the computer, talking on the phone, etc. This way there are less BIG cravings to hit you.

Good luck! And keep trying. Every cigarette you don't smoke is a plus.
"Being someone who always likes to smell good. It's more like I couldn't really even start."I quit cold turky, tried a few times till was able to stay off for over a year. Washed all my cloths, gave away all lighters, and ash trays and whatever else. Nothing in the house that smelled like cigarets are reminded me of them. (so no e cig for me). Everytime I wanted to smoke I would do something else instead, at work I would eat junk food, at home work out or masturbate or play video games or whatever. 

The first 2 weeks is always the hardest. But really the first 3 days is super hard. But really the first day is the hardest of all. So following that logic, once i got commited and got rid of everything, (meaning I would need to make a strong commitment to start again like go to the store, and all my friends knew I was quitting so would double guess me if I tried to bum a smoke) and made it through the 1st day I thought well that was toughest so if I smoke now I'll have to do it again but if I never smoke again I'll neave have to go through that again. Kept thinking that after 3 days, after a week. After 2 weeks. 

Once I got into a month I would see someone smoking and think (wow I havn't thought about smoking all day! It's working better keep at it, it's getting easy now). ""I got sick (nothing serious, just a URTI) and couldn't smoke for a week. When I started feeling better, I just didn't start again. I threw out everything I had and decided not to buy any more.

Eventually I stopped wanting the gum.""edit: removed personal health story as too identifying and too lengthy.

Like many people say, I believe you won't quit until you truly want to quit.  When I reached that point, ultimately using patches is what did it.  

The other thing is STAY BUSY for the first two or three weeks when quitting.  Do ANYTHING other than smoke., whether it is something you enjoy or in character for you or not.  Go out for a midnight jog, go to the library, go to a gardening club.  Keep your mind occupied.

 "I was able to stop driving for my commute. Craving disappeared. "I'm still going back and forth but my most successful stint was when I was exercising heavily. I had a groupon for CrossFit and the intensity put a lot in perspective.  I didn't look the most out of shape but I was easily the unhealthiest because of smoking. Now I like to say I have control over my smoking, which is probably half true, but when I go for that final push, I know exercise will play a vital role.""For the past three weeks, I've been slowly weaning myself off real cigarettes with a blu e-cigarette and now I'm even using that less and less. I haven't had a ""real"" cigarette in a week and I am pretty damn proud of myself."I found the oral fixation of smoking to be tough.  I split and ate sunflower seeds with shells of course to keep my mouth busy.   It helped especially after meals.  "One day i just decided not to smoke any more. But i never told anyone about it, if someone was to ask if I would join for a cigarette i replied not right now, after a month or so i told people about it. 
 I had the idea that if i kept it to my self in the beginning it would be easier to stay on mission, and that bragging about it would give me enough satisfaction, and i would start again. 

Mayby that helped or mayby i was just sick and tired of being sick and tired.

Feel free to correct on my writing.

The importance of good breathing will encourage you to stay clean. "Exercise, the patch, and my doctor saying ""it's uncommon for a guy your age to have a heart attack, but it does happen"". I was 38 at the time. 7 years clean as of tomorrow. ""Switched over to Snus (tobacco pouches) to avoid stinking up my clothes and apartment. That got me off the smoking bit, and then a year and a half later, I found a lump in my jaw area, so I dropped the Snus.

Whenever I want a smoke/pouch, I just think what life would be like if I had mouth cancer and had to get my lips removed, or something. No more kissing, forever?

I faltered once so far (am only a month underway after all)and bought a packet of luckies, but luckily the first one of those I had tasted terribly. Probably regret. I finished that pack about sixteen days ago and haven't had another since, which is a nice start, go me. :D


Also I'd been keeping track of my smokes for months before, placing a stripe and the time in a booklet every time I had one.  Makes being able to write 14->30 jan 0 all the more satisfying.

The taste was so different and disgusting it actually made me throw up. After that every time I went to have a cigarette I would feel like I was high and could still taste it the way I could when my mind was altered. I can barely even think about smoking one without gagging. (Would not recommend doing acid just to quit smoking. That's just my story.)"Getting in a relationship where my SO was adamantly against smoking. I was ready to quit, and that helped it stick.""I didn't want to smoke anymore. Tried to quit. Failed.

You need to get over nicotine, smoking ecigs will not help you with that.

In the short term you need to treat nicotine like a drug addiction you have no self control over: throw absolutely everything cigarette-related in the trash (lighters, matches, ashtrays) and avoid carrying enough money to buy any. Don't drink alcohol. Tell your friends or significant others about your decision. If they try to sabotage your attempt get better friends. Change your daily routine so you don't find yourself in situations where you would habitually smoke (out on a break at work, morning coffee...) All this will help you get through the hardest part - from around day 3 to the 2 week mark.

The cravings will be mostly psychological after that. It takes time to quit - around 2 months before you start forgetting about cigarettes. After that point you will spend entire days not even thinking about them. 

Now once you've reached that 2 month limit you aren't out of the woods yet. Remember: smoking a cigarette after so long will do nothing for you. It will be disgusting and will not satisfy a physical craving. You will feel underwhelmed, try to smoke more, then get hooked again and feel miserable. This is why people will tell you that as you try to quit and relapse you get better at quitting: you can easily ignore the cravings once you understand how this addiction affects your body and mind. Knowing, deep down, that a cigarette will never satisfy that craving is the key to stop for good.

Things get much easier after that and it might take a couple of attempts before you get there. You will get the occasional craving, even a year after quitting, but it will only last a moment, and will stop altogether after you celebrate your first year smoke-free. Enjoy. ""It seems that the consensus is to quit cold turkey, and I must agree. Where I live and work, everybody smokes. So it was really hard to quit cold turkey when there are constantly people lighting up a cigarette around you. So while I concur with most redditors on here, I'll also like to suggest that you should try to isolate yourself from smokers for a couple days. This may mean take a vacation, go camping for a couple days. Don't bring cigarettes, but bring a SO or good friend who doesn't smoke to keep your mind off of it. Whenever you think of lighting up, just start doing something else to take your mind off of it. It takes a lot of willpower, but you can do it if you really want to. Here are some other things that helped me out...

I downloaded an app on my iPhone that allowed me to track all my stats, like how many days, how many cigarettes I haven't smoked, my lung function, heart rate, how much money I saved. It was a fun to have this challenge and see how long I could go, after about 8 months I decided the next step was to remove the app from my phone, erasing any traces of being a former smoker.

Another thing I did when I would drink with friends who smoked was ask for a cigarette and just put it in my mouth, but never lit it. If a cigarette is too much, I've heard of people using a small stick/twig, straw, or toothpick. 

TL;DR - Remove yourself from other smokers for the first couple days, download mobile app that tracks your progress, when drinking with friends (who smoke) - keep a cigarette with you but never light it, if thats too much use a stick or toothpick. It's all about willpower and self-control.
""First you have to want to quit. Not wanting to quit and trying to quit almost always ends up in failure. My wife and I wanted to quit for a while and one day we added up how much we were spending per month between the two of us and we quit the next day. My 2 pack a day habit plus her pack/pack and half was costing us 700+ a month. We quit 6 years ago.

The cravings will still pop up from time to time so don't expect to never want a cigarette again. Strong will power plus a real desire to quit will put you on the right path. 

If you need help quitting try a few cessation products not the ecigs the act of puffing on the ecig will just continue the physical habit. The patch worked well for me the first time I quit but I got some crazy dreams with that shit so I stopped using it. The gum requires you to spit while using it, or it did when i used it, so keep that in mind. The hardest part is getting past your triggers and routines. It was really hard for me not to have my morning cigarette once I got past that it was easy sailing. The last and final time I quit it was cold turkey.""A few things, Vanity, I was newly single dating an awesome non smoker, I was self conscious kissing him and smelling like an ashtray. I weened myself off of smoking at work first before I took the full plunge. Everytime I wanted a smoke, I took deep breaths and reminded myself that every day I struggled with not quitting would go to waste if I gave in NOW. Patches worked really well for me, and e-cigs when I just couldn't take it anymore. Exercise helped stave off the weight gain.. Taking it DAY BY DAY. and the app quitnow on my phone reminded me to stick with it. It's been 80 days now ;) ""There was a program that must have been one of the very first infomercials on TV.  I won't mention the name because the company is still around in one form or another.  For $19.95 you got an audio cassette of motivational chatter, and a ten page booklet that outlined a 7-day plan to quit smoking.  I'll try to outline in a nutshell here:
Day 1 - Smoke all you like, but make a note of when you light up.  Is it that first cup of coffee in the morning, just finished a meal, a beer in the evening, whatever, just keep track of it because these are your triggers.
Day 2 - Smoke all you like, but don't do it at any of your usual triggers.  In this way you learn to disassociate  the smoking from the triggers.
Day 3 - Quit, no more smokes.  You'll crave them, but you will now know if you are craving them because of a trigger, or if your body is actually craving the nicotine.  Now this is what makes this work, and it could be BS, but I believed it and it worked for me.  Each time your body actually craves nicotine, it's because the nicotine is leaving your system, so each craving you get through you are that much closer to being a non-smoker, and the more the nicotine is purged from your system, the lesser the cravings.
Day 4 thru 7 - Ride it out knowing that each craving that's not caused by a trigger is another step closer to your goal.  After the 7th day, your body is free from the physical cravings, and you are a non-smoker.
Good luck.
""I was fortunate enough to be able to quit on my first try but I know most people aren't so lucky. My strategy was:
1. Really enjoy your last smoke and set a firm quit date
2. I bought one box of commits lozenges and designed a program to ween off loosely based off of the one the box suggests
3 always have gum/ hard candy on you. As soon as you want to smoke start going crazy with gum or candy. For me it took away a little bit of the physical craving by taking my mind off of the physical act of smoking. ""I just decided one day that I was tired of smoking. So, I threw the rest of the pack I had in the trash and never had a cigarette since then. ""**Wellbutrin**. Wellbutrin wellbutrin wellbutrin. Seriously. I cannot push for this drug enough. After a week, I stopped enjoying the cigarettes and found myself smoking only a few. Next day, I quit. Cold turkey, which before would have seemed like the end of the world. The Wellbutrin made my nicotine cravings from a stab to a flick. I maybe had four cravings my first day and they were laughable compared to what they would have been. I've tried the patch at least 9 times and I most recently tried vaping. The BEST thing about Wellbutrin is that it is NOT a nicotine replacement. I am already no longer addicted to nicotine. Seriously, as a pack a day smoker for a decade... You HAVE to try this. It's a miracle pill."I'll probably quit once I stop thinking how fucking cool it ishaving a SO who doesn't smoke... nothing like the look on their face after you kiss them right after you've had a smoke I just stopped "I developed a slight arrhythmia while smoking for 24 years.  Though I could have continued to smoke, within a couple months, I just forced myself into believing if I didn't quit now, it was going to kill me very soon. I used the patch for a week. I used e-cig for about 2 weeks. I took MANY naps! Sleeping through it helped a lot! "You have to want to. That's what worked for me after 11 years of smoking. I didn't want to wake up coughing up flem and always being short of breath. I quit cold turkey.  "An actual desire to quit smoking. Quit cold turkey, will be two years on 4/20 since I've smoked a cig. Trying to ween myself off or any other method never worked. ""Electronic cigs are what I used after 1 1/2 packs a day for 19yrs, another part of it is WANTING to quit! unless you truly want it your going to keep going back to analogs, set a goal 10 cigs today 9 tomorrow fill the cravings in with your ecig and when you get down to none pick up the ecig to be your go to device. This is what I did over 6 months ago and I work construction in a shop that allows smoking and I'm still solid on not smoking!""I gradually piled on more and more restrictions on myself. Only smoking outside, only purchasing singles (1 at a time), only smoking after I eat, etc.

Then I switched to Nicorette Gum ... and gradually bought lesser and lesser potency. Then one day I realized how much I was spending on being miserable with just Gum and a lot of ridiculous rules, and I stopped.

Probably took me longer than it should have, but I have been smokefree for 8 years now.""Pregnancy. I found out I was pregnant, had a last 'holy shit this is happening, help me cope' cigarette, then quit cold turkey. If you don't intend on getting pregnant any time soon... or you're a guy, I've had friends buy the high quality e-cigs with various flavors and levels of nicotine. They start with a higher dosage and work their way down. That breaks the chemical habit and makes it easier to break the oral fixation habit.""I went the cold turkey method. Its really tough for the first week but in the end you will forget about it. Will power is key. Also, I found that it was a habit to have something in my hands. So I bought myself some tasty lollipops and kept them nearby.""""The easy way"" by Allen Carr. It's an audio book series that actually encourages you to smoke while you listen. 6 CDs and a few weeks later I gave up with ease. It really does work if you truly want to quit. I quit almost 4 years ago. ""Strangely enough the television anti-smoking ad that said ""Never give up on giving up""

It had examples of people giving up, regressing and then giving up again until finally they were able to let it go.

I guess seeing each attempt to give up as a small success in the journey to end smoking rather than each regression as a failure might have helped.

""I bought an e cig mod and used juices with medium nicotine levels (12-14mg) at first.

A mod with a good battery and a good build gets a much better hit than a traditional e cig, therefore making it feel closer to having an actual cigarette. I quickly lost the desire or need to smoke, and over time I began buying lower nicotine level juices to wean myself off the nicotine cravings.

 I now switch back and forth between low nicotine level juices (mostly for use when I go out) to juices with no nicotine at all. I haven't had the desire to have a cigarette in a very long time.""I have quit for 3 months using the Evape. It killed off the need for ciggs the next day. I have cut down my nicotine intake and the amount I use it drastically from when I first quit. Many people find the Evape a successful way because it gives you a similar feeling as ciggs do.
I decided to quit because I have a young son and dont want him to ever pick up my bad habbit. I honestly did love smoking and probably would not have quit if it wasnt for him.""Tee Tree Chewing Sticks, swear to god these things are the best""My 5 year old daughter used to suck her thumb all the time. One day she asked me why I smoked cigarettes and I told her it was a bad habit. She asked me, ""what's a bad habit?"" and I said it's something you do that you don't want to do but you've been doing it so long it's hard to stop, like how you suck your thumb. She asked me that if she stopped sucking her thumb, if i would quit smoking. Thinking she would have a hard time and not be able to do it easily, I accepted. After a couple days I noticed she was trying not to do it anymore, and she was fighting the good fight. After a while she stopped completely. She did her part, but I kept smoking. Later on I found out she made the deal because she knew smoking was bad for me and could kill me, so she fought and did her part to help me. After I learned that, I quit. Never had another cigarette, it's been almost 8 years.


You just have to want not to smoke more than you want to, my daughter's love helped me do that.""When i wen't to the hospital,to find out my dad had half of his lung removed. He had to stay in the hospital for 17 days. The next morning i woke up from a nightmare i had about him dying. I was hacking a coughing like most long term smokers do when they first wake up.

Went to the kitchen threw my brand new carton of smokes in the trash. Went to the dollar store and bought 4 bags of tootsie pops.Stay in my room for 4 days and didn't talk to anyone.""I got hit with the flu really hard at the end of last October; I was passing out and going to the doctor all week. I didn't have the energy or the ability to go stand outside and smoke (I refused to smoke indoors). I more or less just slept in bed for a week solid. It was one of the most miserable times I think I've ever had, but after I realized I hadn't had a cigarette in 5 days I just kept rolling with it.

I was at about a pack a day, and had been smoking for about 3 years when I stopped. 

Ninja edit: I can't be near cigarette smoke or anything right now without getting irritable and angry, which sucks, because I love hookah."Trying over and over and over again. "Not smoking any more.  

Seriously.  You just have to want to not smoke more than you want to smoke.  That's it.  There's no secret.""I'm sure this will be buried at this late stage but:

I used [these](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/like/161207100583?hlpht=true&ops=true&viphx=1&lpid=94). And eventually (after a few months) I transitioned to regular mints and that was it. I did, however, develop a pretty severe mint addiction for about a year after (not joking).

They're great because you get nicotine and the minty flavour puts you off wanting to have a cigarette. I guess if you smoke menthols it might not be as effective.

My main reason for quitting was price. In Australia, a pack of cigarettes is around $20 AUD now. It's also very hard to smoke anywhere here. It's banned in most outdoor areas and smokers are social outcasts."switched to chewing"Adding time until the next hit. I'm still (mentally) a smoker, but the last time was decades ago.

The whole point is to avoid the social and self-esteem consequences of going cold turkey. Then there's no shame in getting shitfaced and smoking to put a final polish on the hangover, just go back to meh, maybe tomorrow ... when offered a stick.

I tellya, I have *NO* willpower but this has worked for me ...""Make a bet or a promise that if you smoke again, you will pay some amount of money that is SIGNIFICANT. Something that hurts. Mine was for $5000. You want someone else that you trust to bet with you, but if you don't have that person, make a promise to someone you will pay them $xxxxx if you smoke again. Tell everyone you know about the bet or promise you made. I used to wake up in cold sweats having smoked in my dream feeling like I owed $5k.

I honestly feel like if someone truly wants to quit, they'd make this bet.

 "Hate them hate everything about them the smell blame all aliments on then coughing sickness back pain etc. You need to slowly despise them. Also try to drop them out of your habits like while drinking coffee or driving or drinking etc try to do it separately because when you do quit it is nice to be able to do those things without saying i Have to have a cig. ween down. and really try to stop for periods of time a week a few days a day etc just keep stopping for periods of time do not beat yourself up too much when you go back. Some people get all into it and commit for months then go right back the first time they pick up again and give up on quitting entirely."just quit cold turkey.
don't hang out with the smokers.
take up running.
don't even use the ecig, it is probably a trigger now.
don't think about cigs, find a hobby, I suggested running because once you get into it you won't want to fuck up your lungs.

towards the end, it was almost a chore to go outside and smoke so quitting cold turkey worked for me.  

good luck.

/r/electronic_cigarette""So my girl got pregnant and quit cold turkey. Apparently women feel like a mother from the moment they know they're pregnant, whereas men will generally need to see the baby before it really sinks in.  
During pregnancy, I'd smoke less and less during work hours. I'd come to really resent smelling like an ashtray, having yellow smelly fingers and then trying to be sympathetic to my partner, I'd be extremely thorough about keeping the smell off. I'm talking facial wipes, alcohol gel hand wash, extra strong mints, liberal use of cologne.  
All the while my sense of smell was improving and it all got to be too much of an irritating waste of time, and man did cigarette smell really get to bothering me...  
I bought my last packet about a month before she was born. I stopped seagulling cigarettes when at the pub around October last year.  
/feelsgoodman  
I do smoke a lot of weed though.""I got a really bad flu the kind where you cough so much you can't breathe in between coughs. Scared me straight. Figured i got a preview of emfacema and didnt like it at all. This got me through the first 2 weeks, after that it's a mental game just be ready mentality to not smoke. Its never easy but can be done.""I love the story my mom told me of how my older brother make her to stop smoking.

It's just simple and short.


Some years after having me, my mother started smoking again, so one day, my brother being 6 ~ 8 years old, just went to my mother and said to her ""Mommy, why don't you love us?"" and my mother instantly responded ""of course I love you both, you are the light of my life, why would you even ask that?!, then my brother said ""then why are you smoking? why you don't you want to be with us anymore?"".

And just with that, my brother single handle made one of the people who loves us more, to quit it for good.

That day it seems that on his school, they teached his class that smoking is bad that it leads to dead.

English not first lenguage, srry if there's bad grammar throw in there.""Intrinsic motivation, cold turkey...""Quit drinking first, then used the patch.""I met my wife (14 years ago). She hated the smell of my brand. I loved her more than cigarets, I stopped. Love can change people. (not all people, but most). I know she could have just ""gotten used to it"", and our dating may or not have been effected by it... but it seemed important to me. 

Now 14 years later, I still want a cigaret, every day. I then think how nice it would be when I get in the car, or I'm stressed out. But I remember how much it was a turn off for her.... and after 14 years of marriage, I don't need anything else that would stop me from getting some action. 

 ""Don't give up man, it took me about 10 tries but cold turkey ended up being the winner anyway.  Still smoke rarely when I drink but no more addiction for almost 2.years!""Wellbutrin, six weeks of nicotine gum, and replacing an approximate 30 minute a day habit with exercise. ""I'm super late but, at first I started to just buy tubs of tobacco. I started smoking a shit ton less because I had to roll one every time instead of just grabbing it from the pack. Then I got too good and it was fast and easy to roll one so I switched to the vape pen. And not the gas station cheap-o ones. The ones from the smoke shop with the refillable top piece. Although theyre wayy cheaper online (what isnt)""For me it was cold turkey. I had sex with someone that I did not find attractive. At that point I decided to make one change. 1)I gave up one bad habit for one good one. I replaced smoking with running till failure. Now if I get the urge to smoke I just stop everything and just run like an idiot. While I am running I get self conscious because of what others are thinking. I just shrug off those thoughts and tell myself ""FUCK EVERYONE ELSE! I RUN FOR ME. HOW BADLY DO YOU WANT IT? HOW BADLY DO YOU WANT TO BREATHE THE FRESH AIR AGAIN! I AM A MUTHAFUCKING HOMO SAPIEN! I CHASED DOWN THE GIANTS OF THIS WORLD TO EXTINCTION. NOTHING WILL STOP ME! I WILL BECOME THE GREAT HUNTER THAT MY ANCESTORS ARE!"" something along that thought process. But if you cant give zero fucks about what others think, then schedule a run in the morning or night. After an hour of running you will experience euphoria called a runners high. Magnitudes better than a smokers buzz.  2)The secret is to always wear running shoes. Be prepared to run at anytime. If you ever played dota and know of Boots of Travel, then you know how fucking op those are! But for those who do not know of Boots of Travel, running shoes improve your movement speed and make strenuous running comfortable. IF you are fat as shit or a heavy smoker then you are probably slower than your friends/colleagues. Then you are predestined to ensure the survival of others during a bear/wolves attack. It is not a graceful death. 3) listen to music that is fucking epic. I started listening to the song Heart of Courage(choir) by Two Steps from hell. I turned my shit average life into one where I think I am going to do something epic at any given time. 4) Start doing things that you are afraid of. If there is something you are afraid to do, tell yourself, ""my comfortable life will stay the same if I do what I like all the time. But if I push the boundaries of fears, then slowly I will grow. If I am afraid to run 100 laps around the field and only feel comfortable at 20 then you will remain the same. However after the 20th lap, you will start to see the world through new lenses. The new you, the 'you' you did not know. This 'you' is stronger, faster, and more courageous than your comfortable self.  This new you can fuck up the mental weakness of your old self. 
5)If you have friends that are smokers, then ditch them. You would not smear shit inside your car if all your friends did it. Your body is the same as a car. It is a vehicle for your mind. It takes in nutrients and provides locomotion. The only difference between your car and you, is that you can buy a new car after you smear shit in it and crash. You only have one body and one life. fucking treat it as a temple. If there are people in your life that want to come in and smear shit in your temple then you send your Shaolin monks to fuck their shit up!. 6) dont waste your money on cigarettes. If you save that money you can buy your friends running shoes and all of you guys can run together. You think a pack of wolves is intimidating? Fuck that! a pack of humans with their nuclear bombs and vast intellect is surpassed by no other organism. 7) finally. Don't be stupid. If you know you want to stop. Then who is stopping you? The government? Your genetics? no. The only person stopping you from quitting is you. You are your only obstacle. conquer yourself first and you win in life. Fuck whatever it is you want to buy. buy Fucking running shoes. Wear them every single fucking day. Run everyday. If you follow this then you can escape the smoking cycle.

From there it wasn't until I stopped buying packs and found ways to break the routine. It wasn't until I didn't have a normal lunch schedule for 2 weeks that I really stopped, seeing as I smoked a cig every day at lunch.

I mean I guess somehow everybody more or less wants to stop. 

I stopped smoking when I was 24 or so and started again when I was 26 because I always missed it. I stopped because other people told me this and that and that I stink and that its unhealthy bla bla bla. I didn't only do it because I wanted to, but because others wanted it too.

After I started smoking again it took me about a year to realise that I did not want to smoke anymore. I hated the money I spent, I hated how I stank after a night out. I hated my yellow fingers and I hated the thought of it being the reason for my death. At that point I decided to stop and I did not crave a cigarette since then.""I'm on my 30th day without cigarette, I quitted cold turkey and with a lot of weed. It helped.

She would leave my dishes in her bedroom...and when they came out weeks later they'd be caked in leftovers and ash. I once did puke over how gross it was (the smell!). I was also a bit on the heavy side, and I smoked. 

Getting so angry at her and not wanting to be anything remotely like her (because she would throw it in my face), I lost 50 lbs. and quit cold turkey. So...get mad!!!""Man I'm reading all these while smoking.... Makes me want to try to quit again, maybe tomorrow.""Cigarettes just lost taste to me, every time I had one it was like smoking a ash tray, couldn't deal with the taste and quit. been 4 months so far.""I stopped answering my phone when people that I tended to have stressful relationships with called me, then stopped buying cigarettes.  I had smoked for 11 years at that point and it was actually easy to do.""I quit cold turkey.  Every time I would get a terrible craving, I would get up and clean something in my house instead of going out to smoke, just to keep my hands busy and my mind elsewhere. 

It took about three weeks or so, and I was fully done. 

I also rewarded myself by buying myself something small that smelled really good, like a candle or body lotion, to remember that I didn't stink anymore.  "I started smoking for like a year no problem all the time. Then i started getting HORRIBLE headaches when i smoked now i don't i guess its a blessing reallyI smoked for 3 years but never really went over half a pack or so a week at my peak. About eight months ago I bought a vapor cigarette with some tasty ass flavors. That lasted a few months and broke on me. I was done with vapor so I went back to parliaments. My first cigarette after a few months of tasty peach and grape kool aid tasted like shit to me. I quit both. That shit works. I haven't had a cigarette in about 6 months and my cravings are completely gone. "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking. Don't 'cut back'. Smoke until you want to throw up. Smoke until you actually do throw up. Smoke mindfully. Take long, hard drags. Smoke until you think you'll die if you smoke one more cigarette.""In my opinion, all methods will fail without proper motivation.  I had to quit smoking in order to have an elective surgery that I really felt that I needed.  Knowing that, it was very easy for me to quit.  I bought an eCigarette, used that for 5 days, and then quit it all.  :)""Prayer, no lie. I smoked a pack and a half a day for 13 years. I tried 3 times prior using patches and gum, but I finally quit cold turkey with a bit of prayer.""Just do the math and when you realize how much you spend over the course of a week/month/year.. then that might open your eyes. Also, not sure if you have kids but you're throwing away a lot of money that could go towards their future education.""Not me, but my father quit when he realized he could buy three paperback books a day for the cost of his four packs a day. ""I'm so late to this, but my Great Grandfather smoked a pipe, and on the day he decided to quit filled it up ready to be smoked, and set it down on his desk where he worked every day. It was still there when he died some 30 years later.""You know, I think there is something to that. I know that as I have tried to quit, it seems easier to resist if I know there is one available. My mind works weird.""Zyban. I had smoked about a pack a day from ages 13 to 23. I quit after 2 weeks of Zyban, and it didn't even seem to matter much. Haven't had a cigarette since. I'm 35 now.""I just kept trying. If I bought a pack, I didn't beat myself up for it. I just went at it hard the next day. And I used the patch. Took me about a year but I don't smoke anymore. Just don't use a breakdown as an excuse to start the habit again. Just try your best the next day! And be tenacious about it. ""Got a really bad pneumonia, which led me into a coma. It had nothing to do with smoking but I never want to need machines to breathe ever again.""you have to want to quit. if you are smoking real cigs but have an e-cig you don't want to quit. at a certain point I was disgusted with the way it smelled, the constant congestion, the cost, the need to go outside in the cold...it all became not worth it. i tried the gum, i tried cutting back, eventually it was just a decision and will power. there are a million good reasons to quit smoking so i'm not going to list them but the best is that you love yourself and don't need to do something you know will kill you. ""Started having numbness, coldness and burning pain in my fingers and toes. Had to choose between digits and nicotine. Chose digits.

I took Chantix to help with it, too. I had the weirdest sensation while on it...I had a HUGE craving for...nothing. Not chocolate, not sex or alcohol, not cigarettes. Just an enormous craving. Among the strangest things I've ever felt. Try Chantix, though. It helps.""That might be more the effects of nicotine than Chantix.  The current thinking on the mechanism of nicotine addiction is that it is a *powerful* craving suppressant.  Once your neurochemsitry has adjusted to operating with nicotine, your craving system isn't going to be satiated by anything *except* nicotine... your usual sources of neurotransmitters released from food consumption or what-have-you pale in comparison.

Chantix binds to the same receptors, but has a weaker effect.  It keeps the nicotine from being effective, but the craving remains because your craving system is still cranked up at max power from the time when it had to overcome nicotine.  It makes sense that you'd have a free-floating craving that nothing seemed to affect until your craving system renormalized."Stop buying cigarettes "Ive quit smoking twice (i hadnt been planning on quitting forever, it was just for a summer break). Ive found that the key is to NOT tell anyone that youre quitting. When you tell people your brain is satisfied in the same way as if youve actually quit. Not telling people doesnt give you this satisfaction until youve actually completed your goal. Ive also found that quitting cold turkey is just silly, and if you have the self control, just cut back slowly, maybe five cigarettes a day until you no longer have the itch, then 3 etc. (i was like a half a pack a day smoker). Also dont beat yourself up if you break your cut back limit, just try again the next day. ""well, this will get buried, but what worked for me is not quitting solo.  Find someone else who smokes and make a ""pact"" of quitting.  If I hadn't done it with my current wife, I would have never been able to stop.  Not because of her compassion or anything, just because I needed to prove I was better than her :)"I started getting horrible heartburn and hiccups whenever I took a drag. My body apparently had enough of me fucking with it."moving from switzerland to new york city: so much else to do than smoking in nyc. not so much in switzerland.
""You have to want too. Only then, young one, will you have the willpower. I quit cold turkey and used marijuana sorta as a supplement. Also after an acid trip, I realized they were just stupid and that the corporations had a tight grip on me and my well being, I couldnt go on like that. ""Not me but my dad. 

After many failed attempts at quitting my mum got really fed up. She put firecrackers in random cigarettes. Eventually he got so scared of having a cigarette explode in his face he just quit."Chantix... plus the dreams were incredibleChantix made me psycho. Had to drop it after the first week.The flu."a mixture of coffee, working out and sleeping. after working out i stayed in the sauna for along as i could and tried to sweat the nicotine out. then i would come home eat and drink a beer or two then sleep. One vice for the other.""The nicotine gum did the trick for me. Also, my now wife and I gave up together. We were both had a two pack a day habit. Having a partner to talk to really helped. It's been 4 years now. Best thing we ever did. "Bicycling as my main method of transportation made it easier to stop. "Just stop smoking, i quit cold turkey. I was a smoker for 5 years, about half a pack a day. I gradually noticed likttle nuances in my health deteriorating. People would always comment on me smelling like smoke, i became paranoid that my breath ultimately smelt when i spoke to people and being in meetings this made it very uncomfortable to speak my mind. 

I got sick of not being able to taste or smell properly. The first 2 days weren't rough at all, i had to keep myself preoccupied and honestly eating is the easiest way to keep off cravings. I am now 4 months free of the illness of cigarettes and although i do have one rarely, i've smoked 2 since i quit. I am always disgusted afterwards and have to jump in the shower to rid myself of the awfullness. 

To answer the OP, just stopped smoking. However i think it was down to the disgust i developed for the habit even prior to quitting. "Cold turkey"I quit my job to take care of my baby, so my wife insisted I quit smoking if I was going to be home with him full time. Made sense. I used the patch, smoked e-cigs, and generally fought my way through it. I still crave the shot out of them...""I tried the gum and the patch and the lozenges and every other aid under the sun.  I went back to the real thing in a few months.  After consulting a bit of literature, I tried something drastic and it came through for me.  

In order to quit a drug, a change in lifestyle is paramount, or one would just fall back into the habit of using a drug to make life seemingly easier.  My last attempt to quit was over 6 years ago, and I'm still doing pretty well.  I will list the factors that played into it.  I will then list how I flipped those factors to help me out.  YMMV.

0) My fathers side of the family like to die from heart disease or cancer.  My mothers side of the family likes to die from heart disease or cancer.  Quitting smoking is a really really good idea.  Living past 60 was my motivation.

1) I was dating a really really nice girl who I ended up marrying.  We both have addictive personalities so she understands how a support network is important.

2) My room mate really hated the smell of cigarette smoke.  He is an excellent friend.   We live in different states now, and sometimes it can take several months for him to return a phone call.  He doesn't really feed off of human interaction like I do, and he's all but dissertation in a pretty arcane subfield of probability.  However, when I was quitting smoking, that dude was always there for me.  All I had to do was knock on his door and we'd go for a walk.

3)  I had plenty of sick leave accrued.  My boss let me take it for this.  


Methodology:

1) First, get rid of any and all residue tobacco in the house.  This means butts in ashtrays, loose leaf, papers, the spare pack or two in the freezer.  Give it away or toss it.

2) Give away all ashtrays, lighters.  I tossed out my toaster as well since I could light a cigarette with the heat filament.  (I have done that before).  

3) Go buy lots of groceries.  Stock up on movies, books from the library.  Download porn if you have to.  The point is to not leave the house for a few days.

4) Spend or deposit all your cash, cut up debit cards and credit cards, call the bank and ask for a new set.  Leave the check book with the room mate for bills.

5) I let the girlfriend know that I was quitting.  I let the room mate know.  I asked them to do or say whatever they think needs to be done if I started to waver.  I didn't really enjoy the idea of failing myself once again, but it didn't bother me nearly as much as failing the people that really cared about me.  

6) I temporarily asked all my smoker friends not to call for a week or two.  I explained what was going on and that I couldn't hang out.

What happened after 24 hours:

1) I started to clean the house.  I was pretty grumpy the whole time.  I had this semi permanent vein running down my forehead.  My muscles were pretty taut the whole time.  Part of my back felt like it was almost ready to cramp.  This stretch of phsycial discomfort and the grumpiness that entails will subside completely in about 3 days.

2) My girlfriend started randomly showing  up with cheese and crackers, in a short skirt and 3 inch pumps.  

3) My room mate just randomly yanks me away from the computer and drove around town to do stuff.  He noticed a correlation between cravings  and 'frantic typing on the computer'.  This includes games, talking or arguing on the internet but not so much when I'm just reading a pdf.  


After 3 days:


1) I started feeling these moments of mental clarity.  I should state that I rolled my own tobacco and I consumed about a tin of loose leaf a week.  I go through a lighter in about 2 months.  After no tobacco for a few days (and no coffee either), I was able to read a math book without skipping words for the first time, ever.  As a guy who took graduate math classes as an undergrad, I didn't really know what I was missing out on until I was almost done with my undergraduate degrees.  I took great pains to curb my stimulant appetite after this.   

2) I was getting laid about three times a day at this point.  My now wife would spend the night, wake up, come by for lunch when she took a break at work.  I slept a lot when I wasn't doing math or entertaining/being entertained by the wife to be.    

3) I started walking to the library to do more Math.  I was getting out of the house.  I avoided the walk routes that passed convenience stores.  

4) I didn't get on the computer as much.  I started turning the computer off around 9:30 PM and didn't turn it on unless there was something I really wanted to look up.

5) I also worked on getting along better with her dog.  After learning the command vocabulary, I took the dog out on walks, got her to heel, sit, fetch, etc.  Now we get along great.  

After a week:
1) I biked up a hill for the first time in a few weeks.  I made it up the hill, I weezed alot, but the coughing wasn't as severe.

2) I cleared a wide berth from second hand smoke.  The physical cravings are gone.  I didn't wake up needing a cigarette anymore.

3) I felt much, much better all around.  

4) I went back to work and huddled in my cube.  My boss knew not to ask me out on smoke breaks.  I did eventually walk outside to talk shop with him around the 6 month mark.  
5) The dog is a lot calmer around me.  I feel far less agitated over all and she seems to be attuned to it.  The dog now takes up entirely too much room on my bed.  

So TLDR:

1) Cut off all human contact that will make you want to smoke.  This includes job(s), friends, family gatherings, hobbies, etc.  You want to distill your lifestyle to the bare essentials cause you are going to have to change it up if you want to quit.  Socially isolate yourself from the world and only let a few people in.

2) Avoid being a consumer.  Physically isolate yourself from being able to purchase anything.  

3) Withdrawal symptoms are painful.  Do something that will let you fall asleep quickly.  Getting laid alot is awesome for that.  But if you can't, consider other things that will tire you out and exhaust you.  

4) If you happen to have a friend who is nice enough to help you out with step 3, it's probably a good idea to learn a new hobby that would improve relations with whoever is trying to help you quit.  

5) If you have non smoker friends who are all about you quitting, have them hang out with you.  Again, try not to spend any money.  
""I coughed up a piece of what I thought was my lung, freaked out believing I had cancer, had a scope shoved through my nose to look at my sinus cavities, x-rays, MRI's, and several other tests later I realized I was not dying of cancer but that I had destroyed my body by some severe degree and I quit. I have def. had a few cigs since but each time when I nearly die hacking the next day I remember why I quit and get back on the train."Will power. "A priest gave me some great advice on trying to quit smoking: Never stop trying to quit.  You can relapse, but just keep telling yourself that ""I want to quit smoking"" over and over.  

Also, smelling my hands after smoking a cigarette reminded that smoking isn't really a discrete thing--you smell like a damn forest fire.  So that helped.""The 3rd time was the charm for me.  I had quit previously for almost 2 years with the patch, and I took Chantix but didn't really quit, just cut way down. Eventually I had to stop taking Chantix due to the terrible dreams and depression.  What worked for me was when my boyfriend and I decided to quit together, cold turkey.  Having a partner to go through it was incredibly helpful.  He stopped me from caving in (and keeps me in line if we go out to a bar with smoker friends.  That's the only time it's ever hard.).  All we did was decide what day we were going to quit, and when we woke up that morning we said to ourselves, ""We don't smoke anymore.""  Whenever we got wild urges, we repeated our mantra.  It's been just over 3 years now, and I haven't had a cigarette since.  I am still a little dumbfounded at how easy it was.  I expected to be miserable for months, but I just stopped smoking one morning and I barely cared.  It was much easier quitting cold turkey than with the help of any cessation aids.""Late to the party here.

I took up boxing. The motivation of another man trying to punch me in the face was enough to quit.""I just challenged myself.

I have done this with many addicitions, like some games, randomly spending money(having no money helps allot) and just be productive and avoid smokers especially when going out, when drunk it can get tough.""Chantix worked for me. It was pretty easy at the time, but really expensive.  As people have said though the cravings never go away completely. I still get cravings when I get around triggers. Smoked 10 years and quit around 2 years ago.""Lifelong dipper/chewer. All it took was to feel a lump growing in my lower lip. Quit that day. Had it tested and it was nothing, but lots of nicotine gum has helped me stay tobacco free for years. ""The short answer I give people is Chantix, which is true. The medicine gave me the craziest dreams I've ever experienced. But for whatever reason, it also took all the pleasure out of smoking for me. Ultimately, I think Chantix was just a crutch, and the real reason behind quitting was my pregnant wife. The first month as a non-smoker was practically unbearable, but every time something would stress me out, I would tell myself, ""I don't hate this more than I love my son."" ""Ex tobacco chewer here. I always focused on the thought of loosing my teeth and getting mouth/throat cancer because of my habit. That and I thought about how un attractive it was. I used chewing gum, peanuts, beef jerky, and pumpkin seeds to replace the motion of going for a dip when I got an urge. Knowing my habit, I always chewed when I was driving, so I kept beef jerky and pumpkin seeds in the car. I would chew after meals, so I chewed gum instead. I would chew while working on a project or when fixing something on the bench at work, so I kept a jug of peanuts there. I've been completely tobacco free without a single slip up in almost four years. 

Took about four days to get over the actual addiction with the mood swings, cravings, and being all irritated all the time. But it took over a year to get over just wanting to do it. I would still get urges after meals randomly, or when I would drive home from a bad day at work months after quitting. So I kept up with keeping some healthier snacks around. 

The hardest part for me was staying strong for the long run. Just remember why you quit in the first place, accept that you quit for good and already put a lot of work in, then quickly change your focus. I still keep mint gum with me all the time, witch actually I think is kind of a good habit since everyone likes fresh breath. "I just felt it was time.

I always told my SO that I'd quit once it was time for kids. Once I found out I was pregnant I quit. It was hard, and I'll admit that I smoked for a couple more days after I found out. 

I tried picking back up after I stopped breast feeding because I missed it, and thought about it all the time. But it made me sick to my stomach, and I only smoked one out of the pack before I threw them away. I still think about it almost every day, mostly when I step out the door after work. That was my favorite time to smoke, after a long stressful day. But I want to be there for my kids when they get older, and I don't want them to have to beg me to quit like I did for my mom. ""Not me, but my father. He was hours away from having a massive heart attack when he was taken to the hospital by coworkers. They all knew one was on the way and the drs said so too. The cardiologist told him right before surgery (bypass) that if he smoked again, he would die. The whole experience was enough to get him to quit. He still struggled for a couple of years, but took up toothpick chewing to help with urges."Wife and I smoked for decades. We both quit on a drug called Chantix which is designed to stop your brain from recognizing Nicotine. Got a little crabby and tired for a couple of months (was on the medication for the recommended 90 days) but we both quit. February will mark one year of non-smoking.

I quit in 2001 and have not had even a drag of a cigarette since.  I have now been smoke free longer than I smoked.  I was nearly a pack/day.

I knew the time was when I was between jobs and off for three months.  I don't think I could have done it otherwise.  I rented a bunch of movies, got a shitload of different flavoured foods and hunkered down for about a month.  I ate what I wanted, when I wanted.  I figured the weight I would gain would be easier to lose than quitting smoking.  I actually did not end up gaining but a couple extra pounds.  I went nowhere for that time and did not talk to any friends or family(besides my SO).  
It was very hard for me.  After three weeks I knew that I would never go back.  That what I had been through was hell and no way I was going to go through it again.

The reasons I quit were obviously for my health and finances.  I had got engaged 10 months previously and while we were in no rush to get married and have children, I did NOT want to have to go through withdrawal while I was carrying a child.

IMO for anyone really wanting to quit....save your vacation time for a year and then take it at once and seriously go into solitude.  ""I've tried everything I could for 10 years. The only thing that helped me quit smoking cigarettes was water, cinnamon hard candy, and pot. I just celebrated my 1st anniversary last month. I was a smoker for 20+ years.

*Edit: I only smoke pot on occasion. I didn't replace one for the other. Pot just helped with the transition.   ""smoked for ~10 years. switched to roll-em-ups (rolled my own American Spirits, didn't use a filter) which helped me smoke less. it's a little bit of a pain to roll your own every time you want to smoke. also, i started only smoking half of one at a time, saving the other half (rich smoke and no filter). just slowly cut down from there, 5 a day for a while (which may as well be 10 of your average ""lights""), then 3, 1, 0. the cravings will really never go away, though it gets better with time. it was hardest to resist while drinking... for a while i turned into a ""only smokes when drinking"" sort of person. then just NOT having tobacco on me! i'd bum them once in a while, but i felt guilty when i did that. 

also, consider: why do you smoke? besides the chemical addiction. while i was quitting and after, i still took the same kind of breaks, going outside and walking around a little, maybe chatting with someone. i found what i liked most about smoking was (1) getting a break from whatever i was doing, outside, especially when the sun was out, and (2) socializing. and i can do both without smokes. (i do smoke cigars on special occassions still, no more than 2 or 3 times a year.) eventually you will still crave cigarettes and you will cave and take a hit off someone's and it seriously won't appeal to you anymore. it will taste gross, and you will recognize that it makes you smell gross and look gross and make your teeth gross. that is a good day.

I had tried to quit dozens of times before I finally just *quit*. On October 11. 2011, I tossed a pack that still had ~15 smokes in it, right into the trash. I was tired of being sick, I was tired of being smelly, I was tired of there being ash in all the little crevices in my car, I was just tired of being a smoker.

Cold turkey is rough for a week or two, but it was the only thing that worked. I had to just keep the nicotine out of my system. Once the chemical was processed out of me, it was easy to not smoke. I haven't had a cigarette in 2 years, 3 months, and 19 days. I haven't wanted one in 2 years, 3 months, and 5 days. 

I am free. ""I've shared my quitting method with others and, to the best of my knowledge, it's really only worked for me.  It was a bit too specific, unforgiving and inflexible as it was a time & date-based solution, but it's worked for me, I haven't really looked back and I'm coming up on 17 years nicotine free.


The year was 1997.  I was working on a college campus and I would encounter cute girls outside while I was smoking.  Knowing that smoking is really slow-motion suicide--and not wanting the cute girls to clue in to my death wish, an internal voice would periodically say, ""Dude, you gotta quit smoking.""  One particular time, another deeper, more serious, internal voice piped up and said, ""When?""  Well, now I was fucked.  When indeed.


I thought about it and realized that I couldn't duck out on this and also that I wanted to quit over a three-day weekend as work too was a trigger for me.  Plus, I knew I'd need the detox time, so three-days it would be.  I got back to my office, looked at the calendar and the next three-day weekend was two weeks down the road:  President's Day was Monday, 17 February 1997.  I had a standing poker game on Friday nights with some friends and this particular Friday was Valentine's Day.  What better Valentine's Day gift to myself than to quit smoking, eh?  So, I decided that I would smoke up to midnight, 14 February and then I would be a non-smoker after that point in time.  I'm not sure exactly what happened but it was one of the most profoundly liberating feelings I've ever experienced.  It was like tumblers in a lock all cascading into place at once:  Click, click, click, click.  This idea that I could smoke all I wanted, up to a certain point in time, and then after that point, I would smoke no more was was sheer perfection for me.


In actuality, I left the poker game at 00h15 on Saturday morning with two cigarettes left--and I'll be damned if I was gonna throw them away.  One I smoked in the car on the ride home and the other I smoked around 04h30 when I would normally wake up due to decreased nicotine levels in my bloodstream.  This wake-up thing was a regular occurrence for me and it was years before I openly acknowledged it because of the shame & embarrassment I felt around my total servitude to nicotine and cigarettes.  Sadly it's quite common for heavy smokers.  As a very young boy, I remember the local fire department coming to our classes in 1st & 2nd grade and telling us to never smoke in bed.  I never understood what they were talking about until I too, crossed that threshold and became a 'heavy smoker' myself.  I would then, every fucking night, smoke a cigarette in bed while being mostly asleep.  Fucking insanity, straight-up.


When I quit I was a very heavy smoker--smoking 3+ packs a day of Marlboro reds, so not just quantity but high tar & nicotine too--and I knew that going cold turkey would be an absolute nightmare.  And it was bloody hell.  I felt like I was kicking a hardcore heroin habit.  I had some of the most foul-smelling shit coming out of my pores, I felt just nauseous and toxic and polluted, and it felt like my entire system was just puking poisons.  Before I quit, I had asked around about what worked for others who had quit.  Some suggestions were detox tea, which was good as I think it helped move the toxins out of my body quicker and one that really worked well, at least in my mind, were apples.  I ate a shitload of apples those first few weeks, believing that they not only helped with the detox/purification process but it was just a good healthy substitute, too.  And whenever I thought of smoking, I would walk around the block.  Healthy substitutes were absolutely key in my success, I believe.


Ultimately though, I was horribly depressed for more than three months.  After all, I had just killed one of my oldest and dearest friends and I missed him immensely, but our relationship was horribly unhealthy and there was no way I could safely, sanely or wisely continue.  I would come home from work and I just sat in front of my 386 Windows for Workgroups 3.11 playing Minesweeper & Solitaire for hours on end.  Laundry piled up; dishes piled up; and I didn't give a shit.


Six months after I quit, I was absolutely blown away by the insidiousness of smoking, the huge role it played in my life and the subconscious sway it still held over me.  One Friday after work, I was getting on the freeway to go visit some friends about 20 miles away.  I had just left the on-ramp, moved through the slow lane and the middle lanes and, just as I moved into the fast lane, my right hand went to my left breast pocket, where my cigarettes would normally be.  I hadn't thought of cigarettes in quite a while nor did I specifically want one.  What happened though, was I encountered one of those moments that, for so many years, was punctuated at exactly that point in time by a cigarette.  It was like an everyday comma in that particular moment.  Go from city streets to the freeway and then just as I was moving into hunkered-down, freeway mode, that's precisely where *comma* I would light up so many times in the past.  And once I realized that this addiction ran so deep, I knew that this was a powerful enemy who would never be fully vanquished.  Still today, the idea occasionally presents itself that I can smoke 'just one' cigarette, but hey:  One is too many and a thousand never enough.""My husband was told he needed to quit as he has kidney problems, so I quit to help him. Was easy to do it for someone else. 2 years smoke free now"SnusAllen Carr's Easy Way To Quit Smoking. It's a quick read that breaks down the mentality of a smoker and the fear of quitting. There is also an app which is essentially the author reciting his book on camera with some clips of smoker interviews. I watched it at my desk at work. It took about an hour and a half and I have no desire to touch another cigarette. Well I had open heart bypass and was unable to smoke while being in the hospital. They gave me patches but they gave me some wild ass dreams. Once I got out about a week later I went out to a bar (trigger) and had only a few drags from an ecig and still only do puff on ecigs. I'm only 3 weeks or so out and it's a struggle everyday. "Electronic cigarettes. I did those for one year and it separated the nicotine addiction from the rest of the habit. Then with half the battle won, I was able to drop nicotine too.""Quitting cold turkey never quite worked for me, not on a physical level, but on a psychological level; because I found that once I quit the thought of NEVER having a cigarette again made it easier for my brain to trick me into getting a little nostalgic for them.  Then, if I failed and inhaled, well, again that was essentially failing at cold turkey to me, and therefore in my head I was smoking again, not quitting anymore.

Here is what I did that really worked for me, and it was the easiest thing in the world.  I quit, but mentally told myself that if I ever broke down when I really needed one, that would be ok.  It would be ok to just do that, but I just made sure to hold out as long as I could each time.  The thing is, the physical addiction doesn't last all that long, it was the mental addiction to them that I had the most trouble getting over, and this thought process really made it easy for me.  Haven't smoked in over a decade.""I decided I wanted to quit. I didnt want to keep wasting my money but I knew I couldnt quit cold turkey. I started quitting in April of 2012 and had my last one in October 2012. I slowly had less and less, at the start I would be hanging for the time id allocated to have my next cigarette. I slowly cut down to 5 a day, then 3 then 1 a day, then one every 2 days, etc. Some days were harder than others, and a year and a half later I still have days where I would kill for one, but I know I did the right thing and im happy and healthy now!""I replaced Tobbacco with Cannabis. Then just stopped smoking Cannabis! I only did it because that is (by chance) how a friend ended up giving up smoking cigarettes!

I knew my dad was a smoker. When I got home I went straight to him and hugged him and starting bawling telling him I didn't want him to die. That was the day he quit cold turkey and it's been about 15 years since he's smoked.""Exercise. It took me 10 tries, but exercise got me over the hump every time. I'm coming up on 5 months without a single cigarette and I was a heavy smoker for 8 years. I went cold turkey and had a VERY bad day - I was even hallucinating. But the memory of that day keeps me a little bit stronger when I have a craving.

you can do this, there's nothing special, just will power.  every day it gets easier.""The key to quitting smoking is will power. If you don't want to quit or aren't willing to put up with some discomfort to achieve it, you won't. However, there are ways to lessen the discomfort, and after having tried quite a few, I spent some time researching the subject and found something that worked for me. 

There are actually 3 addictions that must be overcome:

* The oft-discussed nicotine addiction
* The sometimes mentioned psychological addiction
* The virtually unheard of beta-carboline addiction, which is a MAOI (anti-depressant). That's right, cigarettes are anti-depressants.

The first quitting method I tried was cold turkey. The problem, however, was that it impaired my concentration and mood to such a degree that I couldn't accomplish much work. Now, I knew this would only last for a few days to a couple of weeks, but since for most of my adult life I worked and attended college full time (8 years, including a MBA, JD, and MS Finance), finding that much time to take off was difficult.

My next attempts were using the nicotine patches. What intrigued me about these is that even at the high dosages, I still felt withdrawal symptoms (and I wasn't a heavy smoker - 1/3 to 1/2 a pack a day). Notably, I was still stressed out and irritable. This led me to research the topic further which uncovered the fact that tobacco contains beta-carbolines which are MAOIs, a form on anti-depressants.

I hypothesize that some people, myself included, are more addicted to the MAOIs than others, which lessens the effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). I could have gotten on Zyban (an anti-depressant for smoking cessation), but for reasons I won't go into, I didn't want to take this approach. However, if you find NRT to be lacking, it is an option.

In the end I used a combination of methods that allowed me finally quit:

* Nicotine patches helped with the nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Even though the box recommends against it, each day I would measure and cut a little more off the patch to more evenly taper off instead of stepping down 7mg in one day. I also kept the next day's patch by my bed so that I could put it on first thing in the morning.
* E-cig with low nicotine (8mg). This helped with the psychological aspects of the addiction, but because I didn't want to simply replace my smoking addiction with vaping, I would only use it when the cravings were so bad I was worried about slipping.
* A list that I kept on my phone of all the reasons I wanted to quit (there were dozens ranging from health, cost, society's perception, time savings, etc.). Anytime the cravings got bad, I pulled it out and read through it.
* Working out. I believe this helped replace the MAOI's, though it sometimes caused problems with the patches falling off.

Please note that the protocol above breaks 2 on-label warnings - cutting the patches and using another form of NRT while using the patches. So I cannot recommend anyone try it. However, I hope this encourages people to find novel techniques *that work for them* to reduce the severity of the cravings. But at the end of the day, your own will power is the most important element in your road to quitting."anal sex"Here's what a buddy of mine did. For a month he weened himself off smokes, he used to smoke a pack a day and he just started smoking less everyday until he was down to two a day, one in the morning and one before bed. He smoked 2 a day for a week. On the last day of that week he made sure that his last cigarette was one he normally didn't smoke, I think it was a really cheap menthol and he usually smoked Marlboro Reds. That last cigarette tasted awful and made him never want one.""Speaking on behalf of my father, know why you're quitting, and don't forget it, then never smoke.""My girlfriend has been rushed to the ER for the nth time.

I have cigs when the battery goes out, and sometimes as a ""fuck you"" to quitting, but I have gone up to 3 wks/month without lighting up an actual cigarette.  I've smoked for 12 years and got up to nearly 2 packs, that and being a fat shit made me feel terrible.  A guy comes to the restaurant I work at and got take out.  I noticed he was the guy who ran the Vapers-Tek across the street, so I asked him about it, told him my reservations, and he convinced me to come take a look.  And the rest is history... I hope.

It's absolutely fantastic for quitting but be very careful.""I changed the things that triggered me to want to smoke. Stopped drinking coffee and beer, changed my route to work, always lit up at a stop sign near my house. Use hard candy, gum, sunflower seeds, change eating habits, eat standing up ect. brush your teeth alot, the first two weeks are the hardest the craving slowly lessens after that and you can resume your normal routine other than the smoking. Also dont let your brain trick you into having just a puff after all your hard work, the cravings will sneak up on you for years.""Once I met my girlfriend I put down smoking. She told me a story before we started going out (and before she knew I was a smoker) about her grandfather dying of lung cancer caused by his really bad habit. I really liked her and didn't want to mess it up so I put smoking down. 3 years later still off of it and still with her. :) Good luck to ya, my advice, will-power I guess. In all honesty addiction is hard but you have to really want to quit in order to quit. If your trigger is work or going outside during your break then find another job or stop going outside where you will most likely be surrounded by others smoking and be tempted to smoke.

"Determination to get into my sports team after watching the top team in the country."I smoked for a long time and tried quitting many, many times. Cold turkey , weaning, you name it. None of those worked, but I was finally able to make it stick about four years ago. My method was in two parts: 
First I broke the routine. I intentionally smoked A LOT. More than I craved and more than my body could handle, until I gave myself a sore throat and my chest was congested. This would lead to about three or four days where I would barely smoke, and doing so would really irritate my throat. So I was no longer looking forward to the one on the drive home or after work. If I did have one, I wouldn't really enjoy it. I was trying to make those crutch cigarettes, which are normally a relief, into something unpleasant. 
The second step was to get my brain to associate smoking with something negative - For me this was the bitter, hairy texture smoking gave my tongue. Every time I got a craving I would focus on how gross my tongue felt.  If I indulged I would focus on how bad my mouth tasted afterward. Eventually my disgust for cigarettes over came my craving to smoke. Now when I think of smoking I get a very bitter sensation in the back of my mouth, which keeps me from bumming from people or buying packs. 
I'm not sure if this will work for anybody else, but I hope this helps and good luck!
"Patch worked for me but il'll get like 6 months off and wind up going back currently at 2 weeks off again."Chantix!  You take it for a few months.  In the first week while it builds up in your system, you continue to smoke as you'd prefer, with a goal being to stop smoking by day 8.  So, being a smoker, and finding myself on day 7 down to one cigarette, I planned to smoke that last one and buy another pack for my final day.  Didn't bother!  That last cigarette was nothing more than hot air going in my lungs--Chantix totally undercuts all of the yummy aspects of smoking a cigarette.  You keep taking it for a while so that you have no urges in all of the situations you used to want one--for me, driving a car, after eating, while drinking, etc.  I know a lot of people have had negative experiences with Chantix--vivid nightmares are mentioned often--but I didn't (and I'd had those vivid dreams with the patch), and I know Chantix can be pricey.  But damn, I was a pack a day smoker, and then after 7 days, I was not.""I put å£730 into my girlfriend's bank account (365 days, å£2 a day). 

If I make it to 28 June 2014 without having one puff on a cigarette, she gives it back to me. If I smoke once, she keeps it and spends it on whatever she likes. 

Obviously she has to rely on me telling the truth but, cleverly, she's told my friends that if they see me smoking and let her know, she'll give them 20%.

Seven months so far.""Honestly for me it was just a feeling of having smoked too much.
After a party I really ended up with a ""ashtray mouth"" and I disgusted myself.

I was getting around finals so I still bought a pack but I'd put it in a drawer so seeing it would not tempt me. But if I felt like I really wanted/needed one, I wouldn't make it a huuuuge deal.
Then instead of going out with my friends I'd stay in and sip on a diet soda or coffee.

The fact that I was on a tight budget helped too!

I hope the small input can help.

After a couple weeks of doing that I didn't have any need to smoke and stopped smoking pot as well. "For me (and this probably isnt going to help you, unfortunately) it was a change of environment. I moved to London and was in a new place, new environment and with friends who didn't smoke. I made sure not to make it a habit to smoke during work or out on the balcony of my new flat. 
Kicking the habit when drinking was hard though. I still do have one or two when out - trying to stop that because I did quit smoking completely for a good 6 months. ""On average, they say it takes 8 attempts before a person finally quits. Hang in there! ""Can't speak for myself, as I don't smoke, but I thought my father and grandfather's stories might be relevant here.

My grandfather never forgave himself for (as he saw it) killing his own wife with secondhand smoke.""Just stop smoking, that's alllll you need to do is stop. I understand it's difficult, I stopped smoking myself, but it's really that simple. You stop.... you get through it for a couple days... and voila you aren't going to want to smoke..... take a single puff off someone in a few months, that nasty death feeling is something you are ignoring right now, it's easy... a couple of days of life sucks, and you will be through it.""Just decided one day that I'm better off without it and straight up quit. I kept reminding myself of how unattractive it is to smell and taste like tobacco smoke, and what it's doing my lungs. After two weeks of this, the hard part was over.""For me it was Skittles. I know it's stupid but I kept a jar of skittles on my desk at work and everytime I got the urge to go out for a smoke break I'd force myself to suck on 4 skittles (one at a time) until there was nothing left. If I still really wanted a cigarette after that I'd go have one, but most of the time the urge had passed. I haven't smoked in 5 years now and it's kinda ruined skittles for me but it was worth it. ""Allen Carr's 'Easy Way To Stop Smoking' was surprisingly helpful. I was skeptical, but it put me in the right mindset to quit and one day it was like a switch. Cold turkey suddenly became easy.

He was maybe in his sixties and he had a stoma and a cane. His voice broke my heart, just so tortured and you could tell it was a lot of effort for him to speak at all... I helped him out getting all his stuff and we chatted a little but not too much since he had to pause to cover his stoma every time he responded and it sounded like it was causing him a lot of pain and discomfort to speak (I'm fairly certain he had had a stroke at some point). When we're finally approaching the cash register and I'm saying goodbye, I tell him to have a good rest of his day. His response is what made me quit.

It suuuuuuucks but for some it is the only way to do it.  Just tell yourself you don't want it anymore, don't buy it.  Oh and a previous time I quit I bought a pack of nasty cheap cigarettes.

Nicotine is harmless in small doses and getting that nicotine fix you crave through a similar oral fixation of puffing on something and blowing ""smoke"" and the relaxation of inhaling and exhaling is all achieved relatively harmless through vaping.

I used that to propel me toward quitting. I weened myself off cigs by smoking a splif at the end of the day....soon I transitioned to just a small joint and the smoking sensation still felt good. Soon I got tired of weed so I stopped completely. The only hard time was when I would go drinking. It helped to go to hookah bars so if I did smoke it would just be there and I wouldn't buy a whole new pack. After a year I lost all cravings. I had a relative who died of lung cancer so thinking of him helped. Once you have been smoke free for over a year and you try a cig sober you will be disgusted. Trust me. "Bupropion (Wellbutrin)!!!!!!

The entire world should be an this antidepressant. Even if you don't have depression it does an amazing job of intercepting the brains addiction signals - cigarettes, drugs, and even food, it's amazing for dieting too.""A she-devil ripped out my heart, chewed it up and spat it in my face (she is a sociopath). I quit eating and sleeping and functioning, all I could do was smoke.

When I recovered I was a new man. My close brush with suicide made me feel like I had a second chance at life, so I decided not to waste it. I got super fit, quit smoking, and joined the perfect college course.

Funny how it worked out in the end. If I never met that succubus I would still be wasting away in my room every day and slowly destroying myself.""I'm not quite there yet but something that's worked cut me down to a pack a month is realizing I fucking hate cigarettes, how they change my energy, how they make my breathing, how I smell, how they taste, the fact they don't do anything for me or give me a head change. So, I just smoked less of the cigarette every time... then when I was out of cigarettes I didn't care  for them as much and would put off buying a pack like I was too lazy to do it or I didn't like them enough to get up and go buy some. Only once something makes me REALLY want one I might go buy the pack. Those moments become less and less where I really want one and I can now forget entirely about the cigarettes for weeks. So happy to be in this position.""I was having a discussion with a non-smoking friend once about quitting, and he said to me ""just stop putting cigarettes in your mouth"". I explained the science of it, and that it wasn't so easy. He didn't buy it at all, and stuck to his original thought- if you stop putting cigarettes in your mouth, you will no longer be a smoker. After a few days it started to get to me because I couldn't argue with that logic- he was absolutely right. Different things work for everybody but that worked for me- 3 years since I put a cigarette in my mouth.""finishing a smoke break and thinking, ""I actually received no pleasure from what just happened.""""e-cig, then i just became disgusted with it. Hated the smell, the addiction, i became mad at smoking. So i gave it up.""Wear a pear of shorts made of some tight, durable material. You will find that you can't fit a pack of cigarettes in your pocket and you'll abandon smoking.""Electronic cigarettes. I got it in July, and haven't looked back. They're quite frowned upon by some, but it worked for me. Is it harmless? We don't know yet. Do I feel better? ABSOLUTELY. my lungs thank me every day. Go check out /r/electronic_cigarette if you'd like to know more. You'll be welcome there!""I used the Nicoderm patch for a little while when I quit, although I found that it didn't exactly work as advertised.  I still wanted a cigarette, but if I smoked one it made me sick.  Negative associations formed.  I stopped smoking.

And, as the span of days between cigarettes became longer and longer, I realized just how good my addicted mind was at coming up with reasons that made it okay to buy a pack.  ""*Just smoke one and toss the rest. You've had a shit week/day/occurrence.  It's okay, It'll help.  You deserve to feel better.  After all, one won't kill you.*""

The realization that I wasn't in control of my own thought processes really, really pissed me off.  And I've never smoked a cigarette since.

You keep it in your mouth between your cheek and gum, and let it dissolve.  But it also sounds to me like part of your issue is that you have a ""ritual"" of going outside for breaks, and that's what you associate with that time.  Go somewhere else in your building, bring a book, work on your kegels, whatever, just DON'T GO OUTSIDE.
""I quit drinking and smoking at the same time. I haven't looked back on either, been almost a year.""I used Chantix. It worked wonderfully. But it's not for everyone - I'm a very upbeat person and had suicidal thoughts on it, so someone with those tendencies already should avoid it all costs. That said, the vivid dreams were *awesome*.""Actually it was a panic attack that got me to quit.  Thought I was having a heart attack, until I was told at the ER I was just fine.  Still decided to quit and it worked this time.  8 years , 10 months.  Stopped March 28, 2005.""15 year, 20 a day smoker here.. There were several hurdles for me: breaking the addiction, then breaking the habit. The latter was the hardest. I broke the addiction first time with the drug Champix (Chantix) which I didn't finish because of its fuck-off crazy side effects.. Those ads that you see on tv with the dad and the kid on the swings and the almost comic monologue reading out all the health risks - yeah they're all bound to happen at some point during your 3 months on the drug (sometimes all at the same time which can be bad). My mistake the first time was that I thought I could just have a sneaky smoke now and then. Turns out if you've ever been a smoker, you really can't ever have another one for fear of relapse. Anyways, my habit gradually grew back into a 20 a day habit again and after a year (and starting a serious relationship with a non smoker), I gradually cut back to day time smoking only and with the help of Nicobate mints (patches didn't work) I was able to control my cravings and cut right back. 
I was still however, smoking occasionally and it took me to get married and go on a holiday for 5 weeks, away from work - spending all my time with my missus who's a non smoker to really spend some time where I'm not around work or any of my trigger zones to finally break the cycle. When I returned to work however (literally walking back in the first day) my brain 'suggested' to me that I should think about smoking again. This was where good old willpower came in and I told myself that I wasn't physically addicted any more and I didn't need it, the urge will pass, chew some gum etc. I also had taken up exercise and weights which helped my transition. I'm still not in the clear, occasionally, I feel like a smoke and when I'm out drinking I still carry nicotine lozenges just in case. Over time it gets easier to say no, and I know that I can't smoke again - not even one, though sometimes I really fucking feel like it. The difference is, I really fucking feel like living a long life more.""Never got that far into my addiction, but i used something called ""free will"" and said to my self ""no"" and then i never came back to smoking ""There's never a good reason or a good time. For me, I was unsuccessful several times over the course of 15 years of active smoking. What it really comes down to- you have to be ready. If you're ready to quit then you will. If you have reservations about quitting, you will find a way to fail. 

As of today, it's been 2 years, 6 months and 16 days since my last smoke. Knowing the last time I had one shows how strong the addiction can be, and how much you have to stay focused even this far out. (Especially when your spouse still smokes.) ""What did it for me after two years was not any particular method, but actually WANTING to quit and BELIEVING that I can. A huge battle of will, not method.

I've heard of studies before that say each time you try to quit you'll do better than the last, my advice is to just keep on trying :)
Good luck.""I had to get a bit morbid. When I quit a few years ago, it was because I really started to internalize the consequences of smoking.

If I got sick or died, there was too much of a chance that my son would be in a really bad situation. Not just him losing a parent... but him having to go into foster care or worse. 

My advice is to concentrate on WHO ELSE you would be letting down if you got sick. It's too easy to live in the moment and accept your own fate. It's tougher to hurt the ones you love."The realisation that it was ruining my life and my ambitions"Just put it down. No real desire or cravings. Never had desires or cravings before while smoking, even though I was a pack a day. Still buy cigarettes as they are the only time I can take an I scheduled break at work. Light up but don't smoke, quick 5-10 minutes of freedom. ""At one point in college, I smoked a pack and a half a day. Since then, I had cut back to only a few cigs a day for almost a year. I had one in the car to and from work,  and only one or two a night.  I just couldn't get rid of those last few a day.  My doctor finally convinced me by simply saying ""you're almost they're, why not just finish quitting?"" In a very blasÌ© tone, unlike the lectures and condecention doctors normally gave me.  After that, I bought one box of nicorette and only needed half of it.  It's been 2 years; I smoked for about 14 years. ""Script to Wellbutrin.

No one could get a hold of any american cigarettes, only these nasty 7 stars brand from japan. After going through a carton of them and not enjoying a single one, I said I don't need these and never looked back."don't buy cigarettes? You will never quite overcome the smell. Its something that's probably going to tug at you for life."Whichever method you use, the most important thing is that you stick to it.  The first time I quit, it was cold turkey from three packs a day of Marlboro Reds.  I went through four weeks of hellish withdrawal, picking fights with people daily.  After a year and a half without a smoke, I convinced myself I could smoke occasionally... Within a month I was back to a pack a day.

2nd time, I took Wellbutrin.  Quitting was fairly easy compared to the first time (only 1 pack of lights per day this time).  I made it about a year before forgetting those things are more addictive than crack.

The last time, it finally took.  I hope.  I went to a place that did cold laser therapy...  Kind of like acupressure. I don't understand the process, but it cost me $300 and I was determined to quit for at least long enough for the cost to balance with the savings of not smoking.  This time was surprisingly easy, and I think it's been about 7 years.  I still want one now and again, but knowing 1=20 per day seems to keep me in check.  For now.""My now ex-gf. One of her buddies said that if she found out I was a smoker she'd never get with me. Tossed away the cigarette, went cold turkey, we went out for 9 months. No regrets. I didn't pick up smoking again."I quit cold turkey and exercised my ass off to help cope with all the blind rage and diarrhea. "My 2 sons, 4 years old and 5 years old, every night for 2 years at the end of their night prayers said, '...and please God, help mummy to stop smoking' They were terrified I would get cancer""I paid $100 for a triathlon,  so I started running biking and swimming.   And I knew any cigarette I'd have would be a detriment to my training.   It's been a year now, and I'm getting ready for tough mudder in April."I quit smoking cigarettes in January 2008 cold turkey. I smoked from the time I was around 15-16 years old and smoked about a pack and a half a day of Newport 100s. The only advice I have is to be strong and have a support system. I actually used MySpace and asked all my friends to post words and pictures of encouragement. I chewed bubblegum. A lot! I replaced bubblegum with the habit of lighting up. Not nicotine gum but regular gum. I stopped cold turkey and threw a half a pack out the window and promised myself I'd never ever smoke not even one cigarette for the rest of my life and I haven't smoked a cigarette since then. I got so drunk on New Year's Eve a few years ago that I didn't feel like smoking for a few days afterwards and just went on from there.Try going cold turkey and after the first week or two you will have gotten past the hardest part.Good luck"A day after smoking was banned in workplaces in Germany, I picked the last cigarette from my last pack, smoked it and removed all ashtrays in my apartment. I didn't want to torment myself with not being able to smoke for several hours and it looked like wasting money, going outside, lighting a cigarette and then have to hurry back inside to attend an guest, while the cigarette burned in the ashtray.""Some people can't quit in one go. It takes practice. I've taken multiple attempts, each time staying away longer, and learning my triggers. Learning those triggers (stress and the resulting anxiety are mine) and taking the time to work through them. It also helps you feel more whole as you conquer those things. Whatever it is that makes a smoker relapse, is the next obstacle to overcome on the road. And never give up!

"The fear of god. Had a heart attack. Stopped cold turkey"I bought a new car. Seriously. I got a new car and I said to myself I wasn't going to smoke in it, so I didn't. I still smoked every day, but not in my car. It made me remember these commercials about changing your habits as the way to quit smoking. Like changing your daily routine. I realized I'd done that. I had no intention of quitting smoking, but I stopped that so I decided to stop smoking after eating. That one was harder but eventual I stopped that. When I wanted a smoke, I had one. I didn't beat myself up about it, but I just told my brain that I wasn't smoking after meals anymore. Then it was just a domino effect until I got to the point where I only smoked when I drank. Sometimes I drank frequently, so I smoked frequently. Other times I didn't drink but like once a week so I only smoked once a week. I actually had to completely move to a new city to kick that habit. But now when I drink I don't get the urge to smoke.  The idea that you can change your habits one at a time is what worked for me. I didn't quit smoking; I just started doing something else. 

TL;DR. I bought a new car and changed my smoking habits one at a time until I didn't smoke anymore. ""The price, and I quit when they jumped to $7 a pack. ""**COMPLETE CESSATION.**

I started smoking when I was like 15, and regularly put away about half a pack a day well into my 20s.

I tried quitting several times, but then this kept happening:

1. At a party/cottage/camping/whatever, decide I want a cigarette , bum one from a friend.
2. Repeat 1. three or four more times.
3. Buy a pack because I feel like a mooch and I'd like to bring my own to the next party, let my friends bum off of me a couple of times for a change, and that'll be that.
4. Have pack = smoke. In a few weeks I'm back up to my usual habit.

I managed to quit properly roughly 6-7 years ago, and in that time I haven't slipped once. Not a puff. It's the only way I can keep from going down that slippery slope again.

Your case is a little tougher. If it were me, I'd sever completely. You want a break? You go for a five minute walk outside, on the other side of the building from the smokers if that's what it takes. Lie and say you're smoking if you have to.

One more thing, *be vigilant*. All these years later I still get the occasional pangs when I see someone light up. They're rare, but they happen. They will pass. You'll be fine."what about e-cigs? Aren't they not bad for you? Is there a reason why every smoker in the world isn't smoking them right now?I stopped being able to breathe one day and I realized that I'm only 19 and not ready to die from smoking cigarettes. It's hard and I don't like quitting that much but it's nice to be able to walk across campus and still breathe."Write down how much I smoked each day and made sure to cut back a bit each day. Easier than just thinking ""I'll cut back"", because you'll always have the odd relapse where you smoke your goddamn brains out. This way you can see you're making progress, and it helps a lot.

I didn't want to start marriage while being a smoker."Reduction of you daily intake then quit, took me 4 attempts. You should focus on you desire to quit and your reasons, reaffirming your desire to quit will help strengthen you against the persistent cravings. I wasn't a heavy smoker so if you smoke more than 10 a day you should look at quitting aids like the patches or vaporisers. If you get to the point of buying that next pack, consider before lighting up if you are happy with being controlled by that little white stick.

Of course, now I have a whole different problem. Namely, a bunch of gear and no less than seven different bottles of DIY liquid on my desk, and that's less than usual (normally I have 8-10). But I'm ok with this problem because it's fun and delicious. Rolling my own cigarettes never felt as fun as making cool new coils.""I realized that smoking was a way for me to reduce anxiety. So I learned Nonviolent communication. It has a practice of empathy. You can teach it to people and have them give you empathy. You can give yourself empathy. And you can give other people empathy. With enough empathy I wanted to smoke less and less until I realized one day that I hadn't smoked in so long that I would be ok with not carrying around the cigarettes anymore.

It takes time to give yourself empathy and you have to be willing to feel all the hard feelings that you had been blocking with cigarettes but it is a much better life.""I had attempted to quit by all the regular methods, Nicorite gum, the patch, etc.  Then I hit on what ultimately worked for me and I didn't even think of it in advance.  I was at the store buying gum, hard candy and such.  It was January 1 of 1994.  While in the store, a scene from the movie War of the Roses came to mind and the scene where Danny DeVito states that in this acrylic container was his last cigarette and as long as he doesn't smoke that cigarette, he will never smoke again.  Don't know why that came to mind, but I was staring at a metal container of Sucrets lozenges.  I bought those and went home and emptied out the box and with cellophane and tape, I put in there one cigarette and one small lighter.  I carried that with me for 9 months right where I always carried my cigarettes.  I think it was a control issue for me.  As long as I had that box with cigarette and lighter, I had no excuse to go buy or bum a smoke.  When I was really craving a cigarette, I would just take out the box and concentrate on it and kept telling myself that I won't smoke that cigarette.  It just also gave me something tangible to deal with other than the intangible craving.  For me...this worked.  As of the first of this month, I have been a reformed smoker for 20 years.  I am absolutely amazed that I was able to kick the habit.  It was one of the hardest things I've done and so glad I was able to quit.  To all those out there trying to quit...my sincere best to you and hope you can find what will work for you.  Oh yeah...still have the Sucrets lozenge box with the cigarette and lighter in my night stand. As long as I don't smoke that one cigarette...I'll never smoke again!""Everything came crashing down at once from almost all areas of life. Made a decision and thay was the end of it.

Quitting cold turkey was tough but after 3 months or so I was over it. It takes courage, accountability,  and don't be planning major life changes at the same time. 

It had been 8 years since I quit and I can smoke once in a while when out drinking and I have no problem dropping it straight after, so at least it's not like alcohol addiction. ""Smoked for 3 years, quit 3 months tomorrow. I quit because I was having surgery and my body needed to heal properly. It's hard to quit when you don't have a reason or if you don't want to. The first few weeks suck especially at work, but eventually it gets easier until one day you don't even think about it. Good luck.""I'm sorry but isn't it illegal to tell people they can't take a break at work? And you'd think working in health care they would want to DISCOURAGE smoking. I guess they really do want to keep us sick to get our money.

Anyway, for me, I found the best thing was staying away from people who smoke. My biggest trigger is seeing/smelling someone else smoking. It's hard to stay away from your friends, but if they care about you they won't smoke around you.

I haven't tried this one, but my SO used Chantix and threw out half a carton of cigarettes after she started taking it because it just made her feel disgusted by cigarettes.

I tried some gas station ecigs; they were horrible. I felt I really wanted something that looked and felt like a cigarette, so they had some initial appeal; boy was I wrong.

The drags had too much air in them, the flavor sucked, and they weren't *that* much cheaper than normal cigs. Nonetheless, I did notice less ""ahhhh"" feeling when I'd go back to a real cig; even the shitty ecigs were doing something.

When I actually bought a refillable ecig, a big sharpie-sized pen thing with an interchangeable tank and a button on the side and a voltage control on the bottom, I realized that the gas station ecigs are junk. What you want is a button that you can push, which generates vapor before you put your mouth up to it. It may not look or feel like a real cig in your fingers, but it puffs like one - you'll quickly transfer the addiction.

Find one with sufficient air flow (keep reading) and then you just need some good flavors. There's literally hundreds of flavors. And you can control whether you get a good solid throat hit, or whether you get a big cloud of vapor, or both.

The only ex-smokers I know who don't wish each and every day that they could smoke a cigarette are ecig puffers. Everyone else, especially those who use gum and have decided to spend life being half-buzzed, always wanting more and never feeling free, LONG for a real cigarette. All of their behavior is permanently modified, because for them what works is staying busy. They can never relax again.

It is their experience that deterred me from quitting. It was the daunting idea that I would spend all of the rest of my life wanting another cigarette. Yet here I am, almost with the same snippy attitude non-smokers have about real cigarettes... stinky fucking smoldering sticks full of dead leaves and paper.

Also, there's a bunch of cold turkey advocates in here right now... don't let them get to you. Many of them aren't really cold turkey quitters - they quit because they had kids, or joined the military, or had surgery, or went to prison, or were diagnosed with lung cancer/COPD/etc., or whatever. Figure if cold turkey were for you, you wouldn't be here.

/r/electronic_cigarette <- let these tens of thousands of ex smokers help you! I smoked 2.5 packs per day for 13 years, it doesn't get too much worse than that... much more than that and you're lighting the next one with the current one... and I'm telling you, I wouldn't be able to sit here and write this much about smoking if I still wanted one in any capacity. The people in that subreddit will answer your questions, including finding a good ecig with the right air flow. It's different for everyone; you'll want some advice from people who have been there.

I've taken more than 10 puffs off my ecig since starting this comment, and I could jump on my bike and ride 25 miles right now if I wanted. 

Forget gum & patches, they're nothing like smoking - you'll want to roll the gum up in the patch and smoke it. You just need to bite the bullet and invest some money in some GOOD ecigs. I used to spend > $300 per month on cigarettes, I now spend < $20 per month on nicotine juice and take more puffs per day than I ever did before.

It's been 9 months now."I quit smoking after a decade of smoking by doing a couple of things.

1) Started going for walks every day (during this time no smoking)
2) Started looking at smoking objectively (ie. what is this particular cigarette doing for me? Why did I choose to smoke this one?)
3) Had an end result in mind. (a marathon. I never had good stamina)
4) Told no one about my decision to quit. (I didn't want to have the discussions or to give updates to anyone so I could simply forget the habit ever existed)
5) Eventually I smoked my last cigarette and stopped thinking about it. I removed the option to smoke completely from my mind. (completely removed it. Didn't try to substitute cigarettes to something else or allow myself to negotiate why one smoke might be okay)

I had tried to quit about a dozen times before, but never got past the 3 day mark. Always started to negotiate with myself to smoke ""one"". This time I decided that I won't tell anyone and I won't make it a big deal. Just remove one habit from my patterns. Never remind myself about smoking. Just remove the whole topic from your mind. That's it.""I quit cold turkey 6 years ago. It was a pride thing. 

I wanted to prove to myself that I wasn't weak minded and wouldn't let something silly control me. When I had a bad bad craving, I would take a little nap. Cravings didn't last too long. 
Then I got interested in the timeline. After 2 weeks, food tastes better, etc. I pushed to each point to see if i noticed the difference.

After I was comfortable enough to go around other smokers, I was amazed how bad my clothes smelled after I got back home. It was BAD. That was enough for me.

I also drink less alcohol, and that helps because for me smoking and drinking are like peanut butter and chocolate.""Smoked a big pack a day, and suddenly I decided to stop. It was kind of hard on parties but when you know your weakness you can prepare.

From one day to another I completly stopped smoking. 3 Years now :)""More than the desire of wanting to quit , you should have a really great reason. I know ppl are gonna say how about your life being a good enough reason, well for most smokers it ain't . 

I went cold turkey and read this book by Alan Carr on how to quit smoking, there's nothing earth shattering in the book but he drills a reason to not smoke in your head and by the end of the book you really want to try . This worked for me ""Suffering from my yearly bout with smokers ""bronchitis"" (massive, wet, chest cold) and as it's not going away, I go see my doctor. After a round of tests (blood, X-ray, ect) she steps back into the cold waiting room, with serious, fairly sad eyes. 

""So, we think we see a shadow, on one of your lungs.""
Me (late 20's) having been a career smoker, knowing full well what I was doing to myself, paused, heart flittering, ice rolling down my lower spine, whisper, ""Uh what?"" 
""We want to run a few more tests, in the next few weeks, but we need you to stop smoking if you can. It may be emphysema, or...cancer. It's inconclusive, but it's a rather large shadow.""

Fear. Pure. Mocking me for my years of wasted know better and youthful immortality, disappeared in a sentence. 

I always knew I was fucking myself, but I figured I had all the time in the world. I had half tried to quit half a dozen times before, with nothing more than maybe a few months success. I loved smoking, I loved identifying myself as a smoker. I loved the breaks, the rewards, the excuses it offered me, playing with them, they way they felt between my fingers, dangling from my mouth. 

But that doctors eyes trumped all that with out breaking a sweat.

I gave up coffee, I gave up beer, weed and heavy meals. I ate baby carrots to trick myself (didn't really work). I walked when I could (sitting in a car triggered my habit), I did things I had never done before that had absolutely no association with smoking. I didn't sleep, I was pissy and short tempered. But I was fucking freaked. Scared to die. 

Didn't have a single smoke for 38 days, wasn't going to have a smoke and I knew it. I cursed it. Hateful for squandering my future for that tiny pleasure of dragons breath, one that was never really satisfying. All that cash I spent, all that stink I lived with, all that grime and litter and effort I wasted. It seemed so clear through the fear.

The tests rolled in. My dad (a doctor at the hospital I was at) ventured in to see the results before I did didn't come back before my doctor ushered me into her office... 

""So your tests came back.""

""And""

""Well, it seems you're fine. In fact you have what we call ""Olympian lungs, far larger than the average person. That can sometimes result in X-rays producing what looks to be dark spots or shadows.""

""So,"" I said unsure of what the hell she was telling me?

Her eyes were still sad, but this time with a glint of challenge, "" You're fine.""

I never smoked again. Fear is the mindkiller. Fear is the only thing that will free you. But you better hope you have Olympic Lungs. Otherwise, you're fucked, and that realization will be terrible. 

Good luck  ""I just stopped.  I recognize it's not as easy for a lot of people, that's just how I did it.  The only time I really craved it is when I would go out - drinking a beer I felt kind of empty w/o a smoke in the other hand.  Over time even that went away.

At this point, every once in a great while I will have one when I'm drinking and it still doesn't kick back into a cycle.  I don't know that it would stay that way, but I feel lucky that it's been as easy as it has for me."Copenhagen snuff.I had a cancer scare."I just had to make up my fucking mind and make it happen


I had been smoking 1 to 1.5 packs/day for about 10 years when I quit.

I suppose it could be economics that was a big motivator.

I realized that at that time with my habit, I would have to GROSS over 10K just to pay for butts....so I figured, I quit, it's like a $10 K raise.

That helped, but really it was just resolve.  If you don't REALLY want to do it, you never will.  I have been quit for 7 years now.  Around 5 years in I had a bit of an itch, but I didn't scratch it and it passed.""my dad quit cold turkey. it took several attempts but he finally did it. on the 1 year anniversary he bought himself a truck using the saved cig money as down payment.  my stepmom quit shortly after when she went into the hospital for a week and just couldn't smoke (Pneumonia).  She says having my dad already quitting helped her immensely.    Some 13 years later, my dad says cravings still hit him every so often.  he chews gum like nobody's business. ...""I might be late to the game here but here's a topic I'm living at the moment. I started smoking my junior year of college ('86) & stopped smoking this past Saturday around 1pm. And it has been bizarrely.....easy.

I have to stop because I am getting dental implants in the next few weeks. I did not *want* to stop.

I smoked for the first few weeks on Chantix (it slowed me down a bit). I had to chug Pepto Bismal with the Chantix because if I didn't, I was projectile-vomiting within 10 mins. I hate Pepto Bismal.

2 weeks into it. I still didn't want to stop. In desperation I went to a CVS & asked the pharmacist if I could do Chantix & the ""patch"" at the same time. I got a lot of odd looks & ""no one's asked us that before"" which I find really hard to believe. They told me not to do it. I leave CVS emptyhanded.

I saw a subreddit about a book that was helping people, so I ordered the book from Amazon.

I decide that it's the ""mouth"" habit that I need to break more than anything & it's okay if nicotine's still in my body so....perhaps stooopidly I go to CVS & buy the weakest patch.

That was Saturday. I am probably 20 pages into the book, which is irritating as hell. Lots of all-caps & exclamation mark writing. I'll try to finish the thing, but god. I put a patch on, threw the Chantix out & haven't smoked since. ""I wanted to quit.
It's useless and expensive. The social pressure from my friends made it hard at some moments but knowing that I don't waste âÂ0,30 every hour or so makes me feel good.

I didn't need a reason. I just did it and I feel better than before. Two months off at the moment."My daughter was born with chronic lung disease. There's no way I can risk getting smoke near her."E-cig worked for me. Make sure you get a good one. You need to spend some real money up front or it won't be good enough. The weak ones will just make you want to go back to cigs. I've seen it countless times where guys just get a Blu or generic weak one and then complain it doesn't do it for them. You need some power behind that thing to get the hit.

I've been free for almost 2 years now. I love vaping. Even knocked my nicotine content in the liquid down to 6mg. I could probably go nic-free by now if I wanted.""I started suffering from anxiety attacks (unrelated to my smoking habit, at least not directly) and often felt like I was about to die.  I became too afraid to smoke, for fear I'd bring on an acute heart attack.""I actually made it in the front page the other day for reaching my one year marker. Something I did not mention that day that really helped me was an acid trip. I took acid and during the trip I meditated and really focused on my body. I thought about all that tar in there and how every puff was causing such damage to my body that I only was allowed one of. I rarely share that advice as most people scoff but hey, it worked for me. That trip was about two days before I had my very last one. ""Chantix + a desire to be around to see my kids have kids

"Working on this myself currently. I just workout like a monster when I want a cig it seems to curb my want for one.Training and then running a half marathon. As I ran a bit more every day I could feel my lungs getting cleaner. I trained for 11 weeks. I was a 15 year 1/2 a pack a day smoker. I still fall off the wagon every once and a while with friends drinking but basically quit for 4 years now. I work out instead. "I always knew that I wanted to quit someday. I waited till I was really ready to quit before I ever tried. I had an xray of my lungs after not being able to get over a cold. It scared me, and the Dr and I talked about me quitting. I thought about it for a while. At a county fair, my family watched a hypnotist show and bought me his stop smoking CD. His name is Terry Stokes and he's got a site. I was skeptical but willing to try. Listening to his cds was like meditating. Often I would relax so much, I'd fall into a deep sleep. He repeated over and over that I was choosing now and forever to be a non smoker. He told me to pick a date in the future that I would commit to quitting. For a month I listened to my CD faithfully. My quit date coincided with my quitting my job and moving to another state. I smoked like a chimney the whole 15 hour drive to my new city. Had a few days left to smoke as I found my new home. Then my date came and I quit. I was still stressed, due to a house not being available as planned....but I didn't lite up. It's good I quit then, because we became very poor after the move. Once we got our home, I stayed away from smokers for two weeks. After that, the smell of cigs was instantly relaxing, but I didn't lite up. That was in 2003. I had been a smoker for four years. I really loved smoking. Since then, I've allowed myself a hand full of cigs. One the day I quit my job. One on a day I made a bad choice. Two after my grandma died. They were from her last pack. Each time I had one, I knew I wasn't starting up again, just giving myself a tiny bit of slack, and then back to being a non smoker. A handful after a decade isn't to bad, right?
Edited to add: my advice to you is to take a vacation and quit then. Go back to work a non smoker and demand breaks anyway or lie by saying your smoking, but just take a break so you can rest. Don't forget to take deep relaxing breaths since if you quit you won't be doing that as you smoke. I hope that made sense.
Tl;dr smoked for 4 yrs, quit on first try using a hypnotist CD but otherwise cold turkey. Been quit since 2003, with a handful of cheat cigs. ""mentally: i didn't want to smoke anymore. i was sick of the slavery.

physically: e-cig""Persistence. The more times you try to quit, the more likely you are to be a success at it. When I finally decided it was my last pack and I got to my final smoke, I went outside, broke it in half and said, that's it, I'm done. It stuck.""i've heard not telling anyone you're quitting is a good way. Since then no one tempts you with things like ""oh did you smoke today?""""Things were going pretty well in my personal life. I realized that life was quite good and that I wanted to savor every drop. I realized I have only one life, one body, one brain (smoking and all the shit that usually goes with it also affects cognition too). It was up to me to keep it healthy. With lung cancer or emphysema or dementia, there's no recovery. So I quit one day at a time. I told myself, ""I won't buy a pack today. But if I'm really jonesing, I'll buy one tomorrow."" And it worked for that day. And the next. And the next. I admit, I did use nicotine gum to get me through the rough moments. But crossing off each smoke free day on my wall calendar was so rewarding. Today, I'm 3 weeks shy of a smoke free year. And I'm very truly alive. "I just quit smoking about a week and a half ago. I kept buying smokes but I eventually just sad no I am done. It was super hard and I craved a cigarette like crazy but after 3-4 days I was no longer craving them. Cold turkey all the way!!I've been smoke free for about a year now. I managed to quit a second time using Chantix. The biggest thing with that for me was the vivid dreams. There were no thoughts of suicide or any of that nonsense. That and a combination of just staying away from bars/clubs for a while.

I can't believe this isn't in the top comments Kids"Probably too late to get noticed, but mine was the realisation that all the reasons I gave myself for smoking (including perceived ""triggers"") were just covers for the fact that I was addicted to smoking. I'm sure folks will have recommended the Alan Carr book ""Stop Smoking the Easy Way"" to you before, but the central premise is just that - There is only one reason why people smoke and that is because they have an addiction. When you tell yourself that there is any other reason, these are just rationalisations for the addiction. Smoking is in no way pleasant or positive. That realisation keeps me on the straight and narrow 2 years later.""Chantix

I quit because it wasn't me. I care about my health. I make a big effort to eat well and exercise. But I was smoking. The hypocrisy of it drove me crazy. I was also very self conscious about how I smelled.

For awhile I was just a ""social smoker"", because all my friends still smoke and I felt left out/tempted. Then I bought a flavoured ecig (no nicotine) to puff on while they smoke and I'm not tempted at all anymore""I quit cold turkey about six years ago on NYE after having a pack a day habit. I got tired of my clothes and breath smelling like cigarettes. I always had some toothpicks and/or bar straws to chew on when I had a withdrawal, which would last about 5 minutes or so. After a month or so, you'll forget that you ever really needed cigarettes. I've also saved over $2000 a year since I quit. ""I started smoking when I was 14, tried the patch (too itchy), my mom got me an ecig to try to get me to stop, but it just wasn't as satisfying. The only thing that made me stop was me moving in with my grandparents at 17, and knowing they'd be disappointed if they knew I smoked. I quit cold turkey, and it was actually really easy if you know you can't have any and have no way of getting any. It's still really hard when I'm around other people that smoke. Other than that, I haven't smoked for almost 2 years. (I'll be 19 soon)""Way buried by now, but I wasn't trying to quit. I just went to electronic ones when my brand got to $7.50 a pack. One day I just didn't want them at all, anymore. Simple as that. I wasn't trying to quit.""I tallied up how much $$ I was spending monthly and yearly. Once I had those figures, I was able to decide on what I could have bought had I not been smoking.  Then it is time to set a date ~ 6 months in the future.

this is what worked for me! Hope it helps!"[My experience with this thread](http://i.imgur.com/HKFvHTQ.png)I was sitting on my couch watching a movie when I realized I only had three cigarettes left. I didn't feel like going to the store to buy more so I told myself that I was quitting after I finished the last of the pack. I finished the last cigarette and never touched another.

My sister used to smoke a pack a day,after herfirst ecig she didnt smoke another cig""Get an ecig with alot of nicotine, then use that to ween yourself, you'll prefer taking one hit off the ecig over smoking a full cigarette. Also, ecigs are flavored, I use a low nicotine watermelon flavored one instead of smoking."Vaping"Most important aspect is to pick the right time in your life to stop.  Smoking has to be one of your absolute to 1-3 priorities for about a month.  Don't start it if you have a big project at work (of if your gf is near the end of her cycle), or you may be setting yourself up for defeat.

Next start cutting habitual cigarettes out of your day slowly.  What worked really well for me was making a rule for myself that any time I smoked it had to be the exclusive activity of the moment.  That means no looking at your phone, no talking to other smokers (if possible), not even drinking coffee.  Basically, I made it so each time I smoked I had to want it bad enough to cut out all the extra habitual stuff I usually did while smoking.  I was amazed how often I was grabbing for a cig just because thats what I always do with my morning coffee, or while I check facebook on my phone ect.  I found that a lot of the time I did not really  need to smoke.  Over time I chose the other activities over smoking more and more often.  Most people try to quit by just trying to will themselves to smoke less.  The result is squirming around uncomfortable because you're thinking about smoking and telling yourself you can't.  Often you subconsciously end up using this ""noble sacrifice"" to justify a smoking binge later on and then feel demoralized afterward.  With my method I told myself I could smoke as much as I wanted, but put the restriction on the habitual stuff that turned out to a much larger contributor of smoking than chemical addiction.  No superhuman strength of will, no squirming around because you need to smoke,  just the slow and steady removal of associative triggers that make you grab for the pack when you're not chemically needing to smoke.

Next is setting yourself up mentally for that last cigarette.  The chemical portion of nicotine addiction lasts a grand total of 3 days.

THREE DAYS...

What makes quitting so hard is actually the habitual aspect.  Smoking is relaxing.  It's nice to have something to do when you don't have something to do.  Smokers are often the most interesting people to talk to at work or at a party (in my experience).  That part of quitting smoking will never go away.  You have to constantly remind yourself that it's a disgusting expensive habit that will eventually kill you.  Once that really sinks in and you've cut back on the habitual cigarettes, you will be ready for your last one.  I don't recommend you set a time table or tell yourself, ""this is my last pack"".  You need to pick a last cigarette and throw the rest of them in the trash.

The next step is to quit smoking.  Those three days are tough and uncomfortable.  I found that putting my fingers to my lips and inhaling as if I had a lit cigarette every now and then helped a little.  Your brain is screaming at you to smoke so I would meet it half way and go through the motions of smoking.  I experienced small but measureable stress reduction with this miming method.  I also allowed myself to indulge more in other things like sweets and extra coffee.  after about two weeks the immense improvement in my health kept me going.  My lungs felt stronger and I was sleeping more deeply.  Over time you have more energy and you find yourself doing activities you didn't realize your smoking habit was preventing you from doing.

The last step is the hardest.  Live as a non-smoker and resist the constant temptations on a daily basis.  When you feel tempted just remind yourself: It's a disgusting expensive habit that will eventually kill you.""Copenhagen.

Contrary to what the package says, chew is immeasurably safer than smoking, and non fermented variants such as snus have shown no negative side effects.

It also keeps my hunger under control and the nicotine benefits are nothing to scoff at."I just stopped one day and never looked back. Quit cold turkey.Chantix is the only way that worked for me!  It may seem expensive but it's a lot cheaper in the not so long run"Actually deciding to do it.  That's all it really takes.  

Your will to quit has to be strong enough to overcome the little moments when you want one.  No bargaining or replacing or cutting back slowly.  Really make the decision.""This might sound dumb, but just simply deciding that it was ultimately what I wanted for myself.  Same with weight loss.  Nothing else seems to work for me other than making my mind up that it's truly what I want so deviating from that doesn't really make sense.""My dad smoked cigarettes ever since he turned 16 and began to be a chain smoker. By the time he was 36 he noticed he would get tired walking up the stairs at work (he works in construction) and just all round felt like shit. 

He had heard that laser treatment had worked for someone in our family and gave it a try. He took his last cig that morning, went to the treatment and began detoxing and has never had one since or felt the urge too.  

I think the main thing to remember is that if you really want to succeed, you have to WANT to quit. Sadly my mum still smokes because she has no desire to quit at this time. :( "DeathCold turkey for my mom. Electronic cigarette and a little discipline... "I was a commited smoker for 20 years + and frankly couldn't imagine life without cigarettes - I had even convinced myself it was part my identity and for most of those 20 years just accepted I would smoke until I died of a smoking related illness rather than go through the effort to stop.    
In the end it was very easy..The way I stopped was by reframing the argument in my head from ""quitting"" to ""freeing"" myself from the constant internal nagging and cycle of cravings - as advised by Allen Carr.  Also realising that the longest possible time a craving would last is 20 minutes - that meant whenever I started to crave a cigarrette it was a simple decision: distract myself for upto 20 minutes or start smoking all over again.  
As soon as the craving part of my brain realised I wasn't going to cave it stopped bothering me - I was suprised that I stopped getting cravings almost immediately and felt like a switch had been flipped. From there it's really, really easy.  
Hope this is some use.

When you want a cigarette, it is completely contrary to your new lifestyle that it seems like a ludicrous idea.

So how did I quit smoking? Well what I did is essentially free to us all. No pills, patches or the like, just every time I wanted a smoke, I would have a glass of water. It was painful for the first month, abut after two months of this I finally beat the cravings.

I didn't know that my last cigarette was my last cigarette when I had it. If you know that your last cigarette is going to be your last one, you'll conjure up grandiose visions of your last memory of smoking that will only make it harder to stick to your guns. If you can, associate the memory of your last cigarette with something negative. Let's say you screw up and have a cigarette after. That's ok. Accept that it happened and move on.

I had the last one in my pack and was about to open the next one.  Instead I took a piece of paper out, wrote ""I GIVE UP"" on it, and taped the pack of cig's to the wall wrapped in that paper.  It was in the middle of the wall in plain sight.  It was a very spur of the moment thing.

I was allowed to have them any time I wanted.  All I had to do is admit I wasn't able to quit.  The minute I took those down everyone would know.  It made taking them town into an event instead of something I could justify.

I miss smoking, and I have no problems with others who smoke.  I enjoy the smell of it, and honestly if quitting wasn't so hard I'd probably do it again.  It was an enjoyable habit, despite the potential health issues.

There's absolutly nothing good out of it.."I had to trial a bunch of new tobacco mixes fro a new possible brand and they all tasted like ass so then I quit after smoking for 10 years."I quit when I was 20. I had only been smoking for two years, so the quitting process probably wasn't as difficult as some of the other ex-smokers on this thread. I tried to quit a few times, but like most other posters, I needed a real reason other than ""it's bad for you.""

I have asthma - that should've told me I should never touch a cigarette, but the damage was done. One day, I was walking down a hallway and I felt a sharp pain on the left side of my chest. I knew it wasn't my heart, because it had the familiar pain of an asthma attack, only it was only on one side and it wasn't stopping my breathing. It was just excruciating. I grabbed a railing and basically doubled over. The pain passed, but I was afraid.

I could have probably come up with a million other reasons for what it could be, but amidst all the initial denial, I knew the truth: smoking had caught up to me. After that, I quit cold turkey and never looked back. 

If you really want to quit, don't just tell yourself to be ""mentally prepared"" or anything like that. Sit down and come up with a god damn reason. One that means something to you. Then, tell the people who matter most to you. That way, next time you have a craving, you're not alone. Suddenly, you have reasons not to pick up that stick anymore. And that really makes all the difference. 

All the best to whoever is trying. It's for this very reason that I don't tell my friends to quit smoking. My words and those around you are useless if you don't buy into them. Find a reason, a real reason, and go from there. ""Cold turkey, I was a dick for a week, haven't looked back, this april will be a year.

I smoked for two stints in my life; once just into college at 18, which lasted for about 2 years. I quit for a lack of interest in it then. Just didn't light up one day and that was it. I did however start smoking again after a tough breakup that left me quite self-destructive and annoyed. Stopped about 9 months ago for about the same reason: I got bored of it. The fact that I was annoying all of my friends (all non-smokers) by taking them only to bars where people were smoking didn't really matter to me. Call it selfish, but that didn't get me to quit. What got me to quit was again the same feeling of just being bored of it. I realised I only did it for a habit and didn't really care for it. Add to that the fact that the price of cigarettes went up to over 20 kn (cca $3.5 per pack) at about that time put me off of them financially as well.

My dad (an ex smoker) has a theory that there is a finite amount of cigarettes a person is to smoke in some part of his life. At that point, you no longer care for them..."I got a girlfriend and decided I didn't want her to ever watch me smoke or kiss me after I smoked so I just did it. "You have to make it a lifestyle choice. I changed everything else in my life so eventually smoking simply got pushed out. Exercise, eat better, don't allow yourself to smoke inside your house/car/etc. I started creating more rules I could stick to like not smoking before noon, not smoking after midnight. Eventually, I was down to three cigarettes/day and they were only when I was walking across parking lots from my car to wherever I was going. I just had to resist the urge in those finite moments because I no longer associated smoking with anything else I did. ""Nicotine addiction is like a poison ivy rash. You will feel uncomfortable and overwhelmed, especially knowing how easily you can satisfy ""itching"".  Hell, you might even scratch.  If you do however, the itchiness will only come back even stronger as it spreads.

All my relatives smoked and it wasn't considered bad when I was growing up (I'm currently 25). I started when I was 11 and made it to a pack a day by about 16 and smoked that amount until I was 22.  Around Christmas time when I was 22 I got a bad flu and was sick for 7 days.  During that time I didn't smoke due to it being painful.  I decided that I had gone cig free for 7 days and decided to continue on.  Here I am 3 years later.

It's quite easy when you sit down and write a list of the pros and cons of smoking and Realise the cons severely outweighs the pros. Do the math and look at the money you literally burn over a week, month, year and you'll realise just how stupid smoking really is. 

My biggest tip for quitting is that You need to come to terms with the fact that one day you will you need to have a whole day without any nicotine at all. No patches, no ecigs, no inhalers, no nicotine gum, no pills. So you may as well just do it as soon as possible rather than prolong it.

I've always understood the power of suggestion and of visualization so I combined the two and every time I lit a cigarette and took that first drag I would imagine the act of vomiting along with the associated taste of stomach acids or as the doctor is fond of saying the taste of ""sick"".  I started doing this 6 weeks before I quit and did it every time I lit up which helped me to gradually cut back.  I also realized the importance of being around for as long as I could for my soon to be born child and on New Years eve 2002 I tossed my nearly full pack of smokes out the car window into the falling snow and never looked back.  To this day I have no cravings for a smoke and I find myself avoiding the smoking trolls that hang outside of store fronts and where I work at smoking like mad and reeking of smoky vomit.  What originally lead me to quit before I thought of my child?  It's amazing what you can hear in the middle of the night in a quiet house in a quiet neighborhood and one night I heard what I thought was the carbonation fizzing in a can of sprite on the nightstand.  Turns out it was empty and what I was hearing was the inside of my lungs as I was breathing in and out with the mucus coating and the inflammation of the lung tissue squeezing off air passages.""Oh, I love this because I'm currently kicking my habit of 8 years.

Basically it was a combination of an electronic cigarette and running. When we started running together, it was much harder for him to run on days that he smoked. For lack of a better term, he got addicted to running and smoking was getting in the way of that, so he switched entirely to his e-cig. Over time he stopped that as well, because he felt so much better running without anything. ""The simplest and easiest thing for me... I quit buying them. I didn't live with another smoker, I was only around them at work. I had smoked for 13 years and I guess I just went cold turkey. The biggest thing I fought was buying them again. I realized I didn't have to stop the cravings, I only had to stop the impulse to buy them when I was shopping and around my friends.

The big part was the social aspect of smoking as well, we would go on smoke breaks and shoot the shit. I would just continue to do this. I just wouldn't accept or smoke when I went and got my social fix, and it was good practice in keeping the desire to take them in check.""First thing I did when I quit smoking was get drunk. I used to smoke quite heavily when I drank alcohol so I figgured the easiest way to get past my smoking addiction is to tell all my mates that I was quiting. So the plan was that everytime I'd ask for a cig, I'd have to buy'em a round. Worked for a good month. Then I started to run and hit the gym.

That day he tossed the pack and the the lighter in the garbage can and never smoked anymore.

Another guy I know who also smoked for 30+ years, stopped by doing this: every night before sleeping he created a ""tea"" with cigarettes, by immersing 5 or more cigarettes in a glass of hot water and let that tea rest all night, drinking it by the morning. The idea was to reverse in the brain the idea that cigarettes are good and creating a disgusting sensation by drinking that gross water.  After a few days he cannot even feel the smell of tobacco.

* hypnosis recording i bought off iTunes that was supposed to make me find cigarettes unappealing/repulsive.  i think it helped/contributed.
* whenever i found myself wanting a cigarette, reminding myself i wanted MORE to quit smoking, than this one incidental cigarette which really wouldn't ""do anything"" for me anyway... basically putting off cigarettes one craving at a time, knowing i could get through not having ""this one.""  getting PISSED at cigarettes for doing this to me, making me hate them more.
* both getting TOTALLY PISSED AT MYSELF for relapsing once or twice, but also forgiving myself quickly too - not letting relapses define me.  now i see them as reminders of how serious smoking is, and why it's great i don't do it anymore, and why it's okay to hate smoking.
* not making a big deal out of it. not wanting validation for it from others.  like, it's a minor habit change.. not some indicator of my strength of willpower as a person or something.  i didn't talk about it to anyone in person. that's just me.

my advice: stop kidding yourself, ditch the e-cig. it's not helping you, it's just keeping you addicted to nictotine.  ""I did a 10 day juice cleanse almost 3 years ago.. Felt like shit by day 3(initial sugar/processed shit detox) and by day 4 I felt great. Hadn't thought about cigarettes for days (mostly because my mind was craving solid food primarily) and by day 10, I had broken the physical addiction. After that. It's really your mental state. Don't think of it as quitting.. Think of it as the beginning of living a healthier lifestyle. Once you regain your sense of smell, and taste, you're going to just be happy to have food again.. live long and prosper."What are you going to do if you can't have another cigarette?"A wide straw stuffed with cotton.  Seriously.  I needed the feeling that I was smoking, and e-cigs weren't an option at the time.  I carried it between my fingers like a cig.  I sucked on it like a cig (probably pulled harder than I would I a real one) and the mixture of the action and the resistance from the cotton slowing down my air intake helped me feel like I was smoking.  I would get frustrated because I wasn't getting the nicotine, but I just kept a set of these fakes in a newport box and ""smoked"" them when I was annoyed about not having any nicotine.  It also allowed me to still go outside and feel like I was smoking at bars and such so I didn't feel like I was losing all my friends all at once by quitting.

1) I really wanted to stop
2) I quit cold turkey and removed all ashtrays, lighters etc from the house
3) I didn't drink alcohol or go out to bars for about 4 weeks - I found previous attempts failed by drinking too soon and then having a cigarette.
4) I had nicotine chewing gum in reserve.  The idea was this if it got to the point that i couldn't do with out a cigarette, I'd have a piece.  It was like a safety net and I only had to use about 5 pieces.

After about 10 days the proper cravings had gone but the habit was still there and I found the urge was triggered by situations e.g. after a meal, waiting for a train, at the pub.   By understanding what would trigger the urge I could pre-empt it.

First I decided that me and the word no were best friends and would always hang out. It was incredibly hard at first, so I started with soon. The more I said soon we will have a cigaretteses, the less I smoked the precious.

I found that saying no did not always work and there were times I would be drunk or in a good mood and commit to the normal cognitive dissonance that any smoker goes through, so I convinced myself that they made me sick. 
I would try to dry wretch. Or dry heave. It felt odd to do at first, but I had a mission to quit and did not want to leave it in the hands of my own brain alone.

Went back to nicotine every time I tried to quit though. Eventually I tried nicotine patches since I lacked the character and discipline to lower my amount of smoked cigarettes per day on my own.

Friend's dad (smoked 60 a day for yeeeears) did This and it took about six months of smoking less every week, before he just ended up quitting completely. As soon as smoking means ""stop everything you're doing, put the coffee mug Down and go stand by Yourself in the cold outside until the cigaret is done"" it loses it's flair. This Way you're not depriving Yourself of anything - you Can litterally smoke as much as you want! - but do you WANT to smoke that much if it means being by Yourself with no other stimulation than the cigaret In your hand? Of course This Works best if you live somewhere cold, cause that alone can make you skip a couple cigs each day just cause you dont wanna get dressed and go stand outside. This might not work at all for you, but it Worked for my buddy's dad so maybe give it a shot :) i wish you the best of luck."My triple by-pass was a bit of a motivator."I was smoking a lot while I was in the Marines, because it was a break from slaving on the aircraft work and the social aspect of it was rewarding as well.

I tried quitting several other times before that but it didn't take. I didn't WANT to at that point. I knew that it was getting harder to breathe and I'd wake up in the middle of the night coughing and hacking. I knew I had to quit, I just didn't want it. 

Then I got the flu one year and I was in the bed for 2 weeks with no smoking. I figured I'd gone this long, why not keep going? 

I got fatter, more irritable and beer just didn't taste as good without a cigarette. But, I kept going. Now it's just sheer willpower keeping me from smoking again. Most people say they don't want to smoke after they've quit. I can tell you in my experience, I wake up wanting a cigarette, I finish a meal wanting a cigarette and I still want a cigarette right before bed. I just don't because I KNOW it will kill me.

OP, I know you can do it. It takes guts and determination. Grab that demon by the balls and show it who's the fucking boss. "Chantix and Jolly Ranchers!  I was a smoker for 15 years when I quit. I started taking chantix and followed the instructions.  Anytime I got anxious I popped in a jolly rancher to keep my mouth busy.  I chewed through many the end of a pen as well.   The taste of a jolly rancher today makes me sick because I had to have eaten several thousand! "Mine was an unintentional side effect of medication.  I was a heavy smoker (pack to a pack-and-a-half a day) for nine years, and four months ago, my doctor was putting me through a trial-run of different meds for my anxiety.  He had me take Wellbutrin XL for about two weeks, and though it didn't work (it just gave me major depression instead), they made my cigarettes taste absolutely foul... like what I'd imagine the insides of Gary Busey's pockets must taste like.  

After three days of no smoking, I realized that I had a rare opportunity to quit without having to deal with physical withdrawal symptoms.  It was a ""now or never"" type of situation, so I took it.  Haven't had a cigarette since, and I'm done with them for life.""I was almost 15 and had been smoking for 3 years. I would quit every once in while but then I would always go on a binge. Then I learned how 2 uncles, both grandpas, and a great aunt died, as well as how my grandma lost her left lung: Lung cancer. I pretty much quit right there.""I decided I wanted to.  Realize it does nothing for you and it's all in your head.  almost every excuse you create to condone it is created because your smoke.  You only want to smoke because your addicted you choose to put it in your body and continue the addiction.  You only crave it because we are creatures of habit, stick to a change in habit and the craving will go away.  The only excuse to not quit smoking is lack of self control, if your aware thats your failing than you can try and fix your self control, or you can end your attempts with that excuse.  either way it all boils down to choice, if you only come up with excuses why you cant quit, you never will.  if you lack self control and keep up your habit, natural selection will kill off those with high risk of cancer and low self control.  sadly, those same people are the ones breeding because of the above mentioned lack of self control.  ""I quit over one year ago. Michigan and many other states offer an excellent program that is totally free to any resident over the age of 18. Call(800-quitnow... : ) Totally excellent! Very good people that seem to really give a damn! How very rare that is today.

They will provide you with clear quality nicotine patches. All three strengths, 21mg-14mg and 7mg. The 21 is like a full pack a days worth of nicotine. The 14 is like half a pack and the 7 is like a few a day. Spend two to four weeks on each cycle. Your already smoke free the day you start, so you don't need to quit as much as you just need to not restart... ; )

 As the level of the drug nicotine lowers in your system, the compelling urge/need to smoke is reduced. Also you feel it less and less until it's almost easy to do without any.

Nicotine is the most additive drug know to mankind. It is also the most deadly as nicotine is received via tobacco smoking which   kills more than all the rest combined... ; (  Yet it's legal? Check that logic, eh?

The federal government rates nicotine as being more addictive than fricking heroin. If you are trying to quit smoking, you are really trying to combat a nicotine addiction! The patches slowly release a little nicotine into your bloodstream all day long. So, your not missing your dose.

As you spend the first two weeks, with tons of free literature, web help, personal felt calls and encouraging texts. It all helps. To quit, you must first and foremost really want to, not just think you should. I mean, are you really going to try hard  at doing something very difficult that you really don't want to do. I don't think so.... 

You can do it if you want to. Remember, if at first.......TRY Again...You can't fail if you don't quit trying to quit. Best of luck, it's so worth it!!!""The e-cig will NOT help you. I tried that but it just made the real thing seem more ""gratifying"". I haven't bought a pack in over 7 months.. You have to distance yourself from your smoker friends and really focus on not having cigarretes around. You have to push through that urge to go and buy a pack or to hang out with particular people because you know they'll have cigs. That is especially important in the first 3 months. The rest of the months are easier because it feels so good to fully breathe again! Also, having a significant other who doesn't smoke helps a lot. ""Desire.  As far as breaks at work.  Download a book on your phone. Don't tell anyone you quit.  Go on break and force yourself to read that book until your break is over.  Keep doing that for a few days. Every time you wanna light up read. 

Reading is good because it takes chunks of time to do.  Even if you can't fucking concentrate on what you read at first. You keep at it!  If your not a reader, magazine comics all of that's online. You have your phone with you, use it.  Abandon excuses. Don't be s pussy,  if you start it, finish it. This will be number 6... Thanks for listening to me, talk to you about your life. Good luck sir! "pneumonia"I had no desire to quit smoking originally, so ""quitting"" was out of the question. I had to instead become a person that doesn't smoke. That's much easier than forcing will power to accomplish something a part of you doesn't want to accomplish, and feeling like a failure over and over.

First, I stopped worrying about it. Worry causes stress and how do we handle stress? We smoke.

Second, I switched to American Spirits cigarettes. They use leaf tobacco rather than the spray-on chemical nicotine that most commercial cigarettes use these days. They take a little getting used to but the benefit for me was that the craving for cigarettes reduced dramatically.

Unlike with regular cigarettes, I didn't wake up every morning reaching for the pack. I didn't get angry if I ran out. The urge was still there but I could go hours without smoking if I needed to, and usually smoked each cigarette and dashed it out once, twice, three times before it was finished. The extra expense of the cigarettes was made up for by only smoking half a pack most days.

By the time I did decide to quit, I was able to do it cold turkey with fairly minimal anxiety (other than a day of my skin crawling) but I'm convinced that was only because I had reconditioned my body to lower nicotine levels by that point. If I'd gone cold turkey with Marlboros I can't imagine it would have worked so smoothly. Will be three years ago this June.

Good luck OP!""First, I am going to have to disagree with the vaping/ecig arguments.  Quitting smoking is quitting nicotine, not replacing it with a different nicotine delivery device.  And to how I finally quit: I learned what a slippery-slope nicotine is.  It literally makes you feel good for 30 minutes and then punishes you for hours until you get more.  No drunk smoking.  No reward myself smoking.  No cheating ever.  No cigars, no ecig, no patch, no gum, nothing.  Because every one of them opens the door for nicotine to get its' hooks back into you.  Once you quit, develop a hatred for nicotine.   But don't hate those that still smoke.  They are just at a different stage of wanting to quit.  It will suck for a few days.  And then it will suck less for a few weeks.  Then it will suck even less for a few months.   Eventually it doesn't suck.  And you will be strong for never cheating and the only one in your circle of friends that can not only claim that they quit, but have also been nicotine free for years.  ""11119 comments... think I'm a bit late to the party. 

I picked a date and time to quit (about 7 to 10 days away). Never forgot the date and time but kept smoking as normal. The day and time came around, and I destroyed the remaining fags I had on me. Think it was about 5 or 6 fags.  Never had one since. ""The most effective method to quit smoking is cold turkey:
http://www.gallup.com/poll/163763/smokers-quit-tried-multiple-times.aspx"I'm in the process of Vaping the nicotine liquid. I have been weening my self down from a pack of day. Started at 24mg now i'm down to 12mg. It's like using the gum or the patch but with all the same satisfaction as a cigarette. It's working so far. There's a sub dedicated to it http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette. It's more of a hobby for some people. "Read a newspaper article about a man who got cancer from smoking. He went through chemo and it was almost gone. But it came back, he could not handle going through more treatments so he hung himself. This made me quit cold turkey.""I didn't like how it felt when I couldn't smoke. I didn't like how it felt to depend on it. I didn't like having to waste all that cash for something that had no noticeable benefit. I didn't like how I had a near chronic cough...

Basically I found little justification to keep doing it, but plenty of reasons to quit. ""Not me, but my Dad.

I caused him to successfully quit a 30 year old, 2 pack a day smoking habit.

When I was a born, I had a whole shitload of health problems. Asthma was one of them. One day, this was maybe 4 or 5 months after I was born, my Mom went into my room and took my Dad in there and used a washcloth to ""literally wipe the nicotine filth off the ceiling"" of my room (Both my Mom AND Dad have told me this story, so I'll believe it), the next day Dad demanded a doctor's appointment and the doctor said that if my Dad didn't quit smoking then, he'd be dead within 5 years tops.

He's been clean since '86 and hasn't touched a cigarette. I literally helped him be alive today.""Vaping is working for me.  If it's not working for you, my question is what your setup is like?  I had previously tried Blu e-cigs, and I couldn't quit using them.  By the end of the day I was always lighting up anyway because the Blu's just didn't satisfy enough.  When I got a better setup (not using cigalikes) it was much more effective.  Most people stop immediately, though it took me a couple weeks.  But it handles the cravings perfectly, and I don't reek of fucking cigarettes anymore.  They taste way better too.

Also, a few years ago, I quit smoking for 2 years using Chantix.  It was a rough go, and I dropped the prescription after only 2 months, but it worked.  I fell off the wagon after being rearended on the freeway and got caught in a moment of weakness.  

My Dad quit smoking when I was a little kid by going to a hypnotherapist.  Of course, he started up again a few years ago (after like 20 years of not smoking).  He fell off the wagon after a doctor advised him to.  (Long story, but basically it boils down to using nicotine to relax the smooth muscles to relieve pain.)  Unfortunately, he hasn't re-quit.  Yet.  I'm trying to convince him to try vaping, but he doesn't want to hear it.

But, OP, in case you aren't aware of it, check out /r/electronic_cigarette.  There's a ton of great info over there on setups, juices, etc.  Getting a juice with the amount of nic jacked up is what helped me get off the analogs.  (I've since been stepping down the amount of nic in my juice.)  Also, with the right setup you can control how the vape feels and how it hits really well, so you can dial it in to where it actually satisfies as much as a cig does... or at least close enough to quit.""Stop buying cigarettes! This tends to work, no cigarettes to smoke = no more smoking! Crazy concept, but it takes will power. Seems like people have a lack of it these days, myself included... Fuck, I told myself I wasn't going to check Reddit anymore today! ""I quit ten years ago when I found out we were going to have a baby. Honestly, I look down at mothers who smoke and I didn't want to be ""that mom"". I didn't want my baby to be second hand sick. It took caring about another person more than myself, and I don't think I would ever have quit otherwise."smoking what?"My then new girlfriend (now wife of 17 years) telling me she'd ""respect me even more"" if I could quit. That + a friend at work who took cigarettes from me the next day when I decided ""I could still smoke, like, one in the mornings"".
I'd occasionally smoke now when there's good situation for that, but literally just several per year. Maybe a nice Cohiba would also make its way in somehow. I enjoy it, but don't crave it again the next day. Definitely don't miss regular smoking (was going on around 30 cigs a day at its worst)"Cold turkey. "Personally i just said ""you know what ? i am better than cigarettes they dont rule me and i am going to prove it"".

Friends who had a harder time quitting than I did told me E-cigs helped them a lot."What kind of e-cigarette do you have? I started with the kind from the convenience store and wasn't really happy with it. After I upgraded to a better system (check out /r/electronic_cigarette) I had a MUCH more positive experience. I was a heavy smoker for 41 years - started when I was 12 and was up to a couple of packs a day by my late teens - and since starting e-cigs I haven't smoked for 2 years so far. You could argue that I'm still using nicotine, but so what? Nicotine, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, and food-grade flavors are way better in my book than burning leaves and paper with who knows how many toxic chemical additives. Now I and my home no longer smell of smoke, I breathe easier and have more energy, haven't had bronchitis in 2 years (got it a couple of times a year for the past 10 years or so before that), and I'm saving a ton of money. Past unsuccessful attempts to quit have included hypnosis, behavior modification, accupuncture, patch, gum, Chantix, and of course, cold turkey. ps - I'm an RN and work in a hospital: it's a tobacco-free campus, so we can't even go outside to smoke. Not that nurses ever get a break, anyway.""I quit cold turkey. My motivation was my future child.

But do some research first and dont buy the first one you see at the gas station because you will mosy likely be disappointed. /r/electronic_cigarette is a very helpful place and I consider them one of the main reasons im almost at a year cig free. :D also if anyone has any questions about them and want to, feel free to PM me :)""keep with the electronic, it is much easier to stop the electronic than the real tobacco cigs. maybe up the strenght to 18mg , i find everyone i have convinced to use stops completely if they use the 18mg ecig liquid. If you have tried the 18mg then try the stronger 24mg. They go higher but if you cannot stop cigs at 24mg i would say you are either not doing it right or are not ready to stop cigs, I was a 2 pack a day smoker and stopped after the first drag on an electric cig and have not smoked for 4.5 years. I will give up but enjoy the taste and flavours and nicotine hit..although i have dropped down to only taking only a few drags every few hours."My wife was a lifelong smoker and could not quit.  one day we ran into an acquaintance who used to be fit and healthy (a smoker).

I then went for the trainspotting method.

I also missed the breaks, especially since I was working as a photographer in clubs, and getting some air and silence was necessary. For that I started playing doodle jump.

I also interrupted my reading for a few weeks when I first realised that  it has put something into motion in my mind (i didn't feel ready to give up smoking yet); but I eventually went back to the book and finished reading it. In the first couple of weeks since I had quit I noticed the nicotine cravings symptoms and in that moment I realised that I didn't want to be controlled by a chemical substance anymore.  I still miss smoking because I really enjoyed the taste of tobacco,  but I really cannot bear the thought of being under the spell of a substance.

If you're pushed far enough physically emotionally, and financially; something will finally snap in you mentally that will tell you to stop.

When you know you're ready and willing to quit.. you can and you will. If you're still on the fence about the concept then don't even bother, and light up another for me too.

TL:DR - Smoked for 5 years, loved every second of it. If YOU personally are not 100% ready to quit, don't bother. When you are; smoke 1-2 less ciggarrettes every day or two. Within a weeks time you will work yourself down to 2-3 a day. Start SMALL, and work your way down. As with any drug, don't attempt cold turkey or any other drastic measures, 9 times out of 10 it won't work.

I started vaping 2 years ago, and when I started I didn't know much about e-cigs.  I would buy the gas station kind and they didn't last as long as I thought they would, so I would run out and the stores would be closed.  Those are the times I would smoke a real cigarette.

I still craved cigarettes because I was addicted, but I hated the act of smoking, I hated the smell, I hated the taste, and I hated myself for doing it. I just rode that feeling and rallied that self loathing and I was able to quit cold turkey.
Of course it was difficult, but I learned to tell myself no. That actually became a really powerful mantra for me - just saying no. I'd rationalize to myself that it was ok to have one, that I was stressed, that I NEEDED IT. But I cultivated a strong, powerful voice in my head that would always come back to any rationalization with a strong, firm NO. The answer was always no. Absolute no. Maybe I sound crazy, but this really worked at convincing myself that cigarettes were simply no longer an allowable option.

I can relate to work issue you describe - I was working in a restaurant while I quit, and needing the sanity-saver of a smoke break was a big thing that tripped me up. I reminded myself that I was still allowed to take a 5 minute break if I needed one in the middle of a night. And I would try to achieve the same things that were relaxing about the smoke break, sans cigarette. For me it was stepping outside, away from the chaos, spending a few minutes alone to regroup, and taking deep breaths (as though inhaling a cig...except not). Give yourself permission to take that 5 minute break, take some deep breaths - it'll help!

I'd been smoking for about 2 years at that point, and had been thinking about quitting. I just thought to myself ""If she can quit after decades, I can quit"". Went cold turkey a week after and I've never smoked a cigarette since. You have to be real with yourself and actually want to quit. Every time you want one, think to yourself Is it worth dying for? Is it really? Never let yourself fall back, not even one cigarette. I also got an e-cig about 6 months after I quit and I've never wanted to go back since.""All the pressure from my wife didn't make a difference, the difference was coming to the realisation in my own mind that I wanted to quit. Part of this was acceptance that I love cigarettes and anything to do with smoking, but you know what I love even more? The freedom of not having a habit that needs to be fed regularly. I was always thinking how long it was until my next cigarette. At work, it would be like, ok there's two hours to go until lunch. At dinners, it would be like, ok the main course has just about finished, finally I can go for a ciggie. At home, straight from bed to porch to light up a ciggie. The feeling of being freed from the slavery to this habit is unbelievable, and therefore why I'm not going back. 


I've even had a couple of ciggies when I've been really drunk. Still no urge to take up the habit again.

I had tried quitting at least a dozen times. I think that is a helpful precondition for some reason. My primary motivation the time it actually stuck was that I noticed I smoked whenever someone or something pissed me off as a way to ""stuff"" my feelings so I wouldn't blow up. I decided to give myself permission to be a raging asshole for as long as it took to stop. I warned my friends.

I also noticed that I never felt like smoking when lying dow. So when I would get the urge I would lie down and the feeling would pass. I also used the well known technique of reminding myself the urge would eventually pass if I could put up with the pain. As the days passed, I got enough chemical freedom to become aware of the sensation in my fingers when I would sneak a hit. That was scary!

I don't find it hard at all to not smoke sober. I could care less. Get me wasted, it's another story. I went from May 2013 till this month before smoking again. I think stress triggers it (I had/have huge job/family/housing) stress all at once. 

What made me stop the first time was the fact that I liked a girl who didn't smoke (now my wife) and I knew I wasn't going to be with her long if I did smoke. I think the first month was really rough. I went for about year before ever smoking again, and again it was when I was drunk. I have no idea why it is so easy not to smoke when I'm sober now. I remember breaking down and feeling like I was going to explode if I didn't smoke for a few days..""My dad quite when he started having major smoking related health related problems. The second time his lungs collapsed about 10 years ago. They still collapse a few times a year since the damage has been done, but the doctor says they are healthier now than when he was still smoking.""As a former 4 pack a day smoker:

1. Decide you want to quit.  I had pneumonia and was still trying to smoke when I had a ""what the fuck am I doing?!"" moment of clarity.  I decided I REALLY wanted to stop.
2. Depending on how much you smoke.  You might do the patch to ease yourself off the nicotine and reduce the withdrawal symptoms.  I did the whole regimen.
3. Never touch a cigarette.  No social smoking. No ""only when I drink"". No nothing.  15 years after quitting, I fear relapse from even holding a cigarette for someone.  I've had numerous ""relapse"" dreams.  DON'T TOUCH THEM!  NO EXCUSES!!!"A good quality electronic cigarette-NOT a gas station disposable one-try an EVOD by Kangertech :)The best technique is to chain smoke a pack of red hundreds until you throw up and can't stand the smell of a cigarette. Worked for me :) "Determination.  I had to be 100% committed to quiting.  My last cigarette needed to be my last cigarette.  No bumming or cheating.  I knew I would never quit that way.

That and I replaced cigarettes with mentos.  I ate so many of those fucking mints.""What worked for me is an MVP 2.0  e-cig mod and juices from the Vapor Chef and Cyclops vapor. I'm only 24 days a non smoker but have had absolutely zero cravings for a cigarette. 
""Disapproving long-term significant other is really the only sure-fire way if you have no discipline. I was a smoker for 11 years, joined the Army which made it worse. I was up to 3 packs a day when I got out. 

I've always been a disciplined person so I quit cold turkey 2 years ago without a relapse. I think people generally think that all you have to do is just ""stop smoking"" which isn't true at all. It requires a serious look at yourself, your level of commitment, discipline, and self-worth (most people are hesistant to look that closely at themselves.)

At the end of the day, you have to look inward and make a conscious decision that you will never smoke again. The discipline to stay quit lies beneath that deciding moment. Do you want to smoke again? Have you left yourself any mental ""outs""? Common ""outs"" I've seen are people who rationalize it, or trivilalize the mental damage you are doing to yourself when you relapse. You have to first value yourself, your decision, and your body before you can think about quitting forever.

TLDR; Quitting smoking is no problem. The hard part is to quit being the person who was a smoker."E-cigs lol"So at least you recognize wanting to quit. Now try starting to associate every cigarette as a vile disgusting nasty flavored cancer invoking poison. That way each cigarette you take makes start to cringe. Then start weening it down from a pack to half a pack to maybe 2-3 a day. Always reminding you how nasty each one is.( Possible accelerator here-should you get sick, with the vile thought of a cigarette- smoke one, that might really have you hate them) i hope you can see what i'm trying to have you invision and process here. You want to remember your last cigarette as the most disguting thing ever! Which ever that last cigarette will be. And if you havent smoked in awile then smoke one for what ever reason, that doesnt mean oh well i guess i can smoke more now. No that just means you're  now down to 1-2 cigarettes a month or 1-2 in a year. But remember never be like ah man that was so good or i needed that. Its always gonna have to be arghh gross why did i do that. ""Chantix worked great once I I stayed off them for 8 months. After that it was just trying and trying again. You get better with each try. Remember to try to not let yourself feel guilty. Guilt is like poison for change. People feel guilty and then, generally, do the same behavior again. Instead lead guilt behind and strive for change. No reason to feel guilty if you're changing. ""I smoked for 6 years from 16-22.  I quit during college because I was getting fat and starting substituting unhealthy behavior (day drinking and smoking) into running.  I absolutely hated it at first.  Whenever I would be at the breaking point of wanting a cigarette, I would go for a run.  It is ridiculous how well it worked.  You can't just stop smoking and leave a void, you have to stuff something into its place.  Mine was exercise.  

Good luck to you on your endeavor!""Practice, practice, practice.""Chantix, get it from ur doctor. Shits wonderful.""I had to quit because work went smoke free.  It would take me 15 minutes to get off campus to have a smoke and another 15 back.  It would have been my entire lunch break.  The only time we were supposed to be allowed off was during lunch.  I enjoyed playing cards at lunch and didn't think I could go on not smoking for 9 hours straight.  This is after 9 years.  I couldn't go 2 hours without a cigarette, tried more times than I could count to quit.  I quit 5+ years ago, still know when my last cig was.""I should add that I used the lozenge and an antidepressant, buproprion, which makes cigs taste horrible.  I had some success (about a month or two smoke free) doing that previously.""Not me, but my dad. He quit cold turkey when he was in his early-mid 20s. He thought long and hard what his life ment to him and thought ""what the fuck am I doing with my life"" that was the day he quit cigarettes and weed""I found that my e-cig was the way to go.  I simply stopped carrying real ones with me, and had no choice but to use my e-cig.  I don't leave home without it now.""Last year I spent 9 months writing 196 pages that focused on three endgame policy strategies with the goal of decreasing the number of smoking-related deaths in the United States. These three strategies were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively in order to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and how each strategy could complement the others.  I learned too many facts.

And the fear of getting wrinkles earlier in life finally sank in as well.""As a healthcare worker that *doesn't* get breaks because I'm a nonsmoker, I can understand the appeal. ""I love my wife so much I realized that I would just be dying a horrible premature death and I didn't want to subject her to that. It was selfish. Also , the money we saved quitting per month was exactly the difference between our rent at the time and our mortgage we were about to get. Monthly payments the same, plus more house, less death and more love? Easy. (Not really but it worked for me... The third time. Plus the patch)""A few things happened all around the same time. My little sister found out that I smoked and she wanted to be just like me in every way when she grows up, and that made me feel like shit. So that motivated me to stop. 

Cloves were my cigarette of choice. Those were no longer sold in my area, so getting packs of them would become a hassle. I used this as a motivation to quit, I decided I wouldn't switch to another kind of cigarette.

My depression ended, I started wanting to live for several more decades again and decided to quit smoking cigars as well. I replaced smoking with a rekindled addiction to caffeine. That's not good for me either. Coffee is the lesser of two evils. It's the cheaper of two evils. It's the socially acceptable of two evils. It's the better tasting and smelling of two evils. 

But those first two weeks of quitting are hell. ""Vaping, as some others have said. Quit ""cold turkey"". Finished a pack on a Tuesday night. Went into the vape shop the next day and got a short class, and never haven't had a real one since. I've gone from 24 mg down to 12 mg nicotine in just over a year and a half. If you're using those gas station cigalikes, you're doing it wrong. "Quitting really. Its all will power. "Fitness. 

I noticed that I was getting winded at the slightest exertion.  

That, and a girl wouldn't make out with me because I smelled and tasted like an ashtray. 

That was enough. Quit over 20 years ago. Last time I even tasted a cig was over 10 years ago. 

Won't ever go back. ""One day I woke up and decided that I wanted to quit, I really don't think it is possible to quit if you do not want to.

It was also much easier because I was moving around the same time, change of scenery can help out a lot.""I smoked for 3 years, my friends were all worried about it but i told them when i want to stop, i would stop of my own accord as it was, at the time what i wanted and needed to do, it was a couple of months after christmas and i just said to myself *no more* and going from a pack a day to 0 packs for the past 5 years was a case of over night will power.

Those people who say they cant quit, are fucking bullshitters because its as simple as turning off a light switch."ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. Not shitty ones that look like cigarettes actual good ones. Go to r/electronic_cigarette and read the FAQ side bar and stuffSTOP BUYING THEM!!!! Jesus christ..."Repetition. I don't think there's a magic bullet. Just keep quitting. Read up on how addiction works and realize that cravings only last five minutes or so. It makes it easier. I used whyquit.com for information. Whether it's entirely scientific or not, I don't know or care. Some of their tips (like drinking cranberry juice to help fight cravings) helped me get through the first few crucial days. It also helped me to know that physical addiction doesn't last all that long when you quit. ""Yo no one else has really given this a vote yet, but for me it was patches and hypnotism. I know it sounds like nonsense, but's just a few minutes a day where you focus only on relaxing, and repeating these little mantras to yourself. One I really like was, ""I don't think of my self as a non-jet skier, I just don't think about it"".

The patches helped with physical cravings in a big way, so I could focus on the mental challenges. There are some kick-ass apps that have it all built in including a tracker that calculates how many days it's been and how much you've saved.

One last note, the hypnotism will only work if you want it to, and give it a few weeks. If you go into like ""this is bullshit"" it will never help. I actually still meditate frequently as a result.""Cold Turkey, I ate a lot of it.""I smoked for 7 years, 17 to 24. I quit with the patch for 3 months, it worked because i wanted to quit, but i started again. I tried the patch again, not really wanting to like the first time, didn't work. Once again, i really wanted to stop, so i bought a Blu disposable e cig, used it for a week and felt no need to smoke another cigarette again. I ended up getting a real ecig, with the flavored juice and all that good stuff, and use it once in a while with zero nicotine juice. Its been 10 months and i can honestly say that ill never smoke another cigarette again. Good luck everyone!""Three things for me.. Being mentally prepared to give them up, Nicotine Patches, and Cannabis. 

Firstly you've got to be genuinely mentally prepared to give up Smoking. If you haven't got the right frame of mind, the addiction will always pull you back in. For a couple of weeks before you attempt it. Keep reminding yourself that the day looming to when you are going to initiate the attempt, and be upbeat about it while reminding yourself of the positive changes that you're about to experience.

Patches relieved the Nicotine Cravings, once you feel confident to reduce your nicotine intake, cut the patches down to size instead of buying patches of a lower concentrate (of nicotine). It should be a cheaper option, while achieving the same results (getting the required nicotine intake).

And lastly, I've smoked Cannabis off and on over the years. When that occasional urge to intake some form of smoke, I found Cannabis ticked that box as well. Fortunately for me, I really don't crave it, and very rarely ever indulge in that anymore either..

I'm so happy I beat the Nicotine addiction, as I never thought I could, because was a heavy smoker. All the Best to those considering kicking the addiction!""Nut up and just do it.

Edit: Yeah, it's not easy, and it doesn't get easier. My cravings have never really gone away. It's a little voice that you learn to ignore after a while. Will power."Running.  you can't run and smoke. "My dog got sick. The vet said that if I smoke around him it'll make it worse. I love that dog so much, and i didn't want to make him worse. So I threw out my pack when I left the vet, and never smoked again.""Bit late, but 4 year smoker here. 3 months no smoking. 
One morning I woke up, had a cigarette and felt sick after. An hour later I had another and vomited. I began associating smoking with vomiting/sickly feelings for about a week and then I just stopped because it was making me so sick. The smell still makes me feel like I have a full on stomach ache, I think that's going to deter me from going back. Can't stand the things now. So glad I quit! ""Two things: 

1) My therapist told me to quit. I was 21, in a bad relationship, and I had only smoked for a year and a half or two. It was our very first session. I think she only ever told me to do two things during my time seeing her: quit smoking, and breakup with your girlfriend.

2) Oranges. They are amazing. They take about 3-5 minutes to peel. They are sweet. They are good for you. They give you some immediate satisfaction. If I really wanted a cigarette, I would eat an orange. I probably went through a bag of oranges every two days. I only smoked a half a pack a day, though. I don't think I could have done a two-bag-a-day orange habit."Bad case of the flu. Every time I tried to smoke wound up a 15 minute coughing fit. Stopped and 5 days later the flu was over and so was the physical addiction. The psychological part lingered for a year but that was it."Cold turkey w/ the patch. Relieve yourself of the physical habit first, than relieve yourself of the chemicals.

Avoid people and places that make you want smoke the most, the urge is the most unbearable when you smell it (olfactory senses trigger the most vivid urges as with memories).

I'm a month clean today and it started with others quitting around me. If your friends or family are habitual smokers, than ask them to be mindful and not to do it around you.

Hope this helps somewhat "I honestly just stopped."Running and rock climbing, healthy food, and by surrounding myself with people of a positive attitude, or at least positive traits to influence me.  Yes, this means that there are a lot of people I can't hang around anymore, but I'm way better off for it.  Incidentally, people with a higher neanderthal content in their DNA (of which I am one) also generally have a harder time quitting smoking, according to something I read on the internets recently.""I'm using Chantix right now. 

It works fine, i haven't smoked in a month.""What kind of electronic cigarette do you have?  This is more important than some might think.  The ""cig-a-like"" brands IE: Blu, & NJoy that are sold at convenience stores never worked for me.  

It wasn't until I went to an electronic cigarette shop and got a simple ego battery and kanger tank setup that I was able to actually quit.  I eventually got much more into the ecig game and upgraded my unit numerous times to achieve a better vaping experience.  I smoked cigarettes for a week while I got used to the ecig and then quite to never have one again.  That was April of last year and I've since quit using the ecig after stepping down nicotine levels.  

Nothing in the past had worked for me. (list all other cessation methods here aside from hypnotism)  I was a pack and a half a day smoker and I was pretty sure that I'd never be able to quit.  But then... KARATE CHOPPP! Habit smashed with relatively little pain, and I could toot away on my ecig at work during my break just like I used to.  Same nicotine buzz, better taste, no smell, it changed my life to say the least.  

I gave all of my old ecig stuff to my brother who smoked 2 packs a day and he has since quit.  He liked menthol, I didn't, whatever your preference a decent $30-$50 ecig setup with some juice you really like might just work for you.  If you have questions about it feel free to ask or go say hello to the friendly folks at [r/electronic-cigarette](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/) I've since unsubscribed but can say that they were instrumental in helping me quit with ecigs. ""Mixed nicorette with sugarless gum and slowly made the nicorette pieces smaller. After 30 years of smoking and many tries, it worked for me. Also you simply have to be ready to quit, not just want to quit. 15 years nicotine free."My wife and I quit at the same time and she said to just remember that you will always want one. For some reason just knowing that helped us quit and the cravings just went away. I haven't smoked for over 20 years."Before I was born, I guess my brother who was a toddler at the time said to my mom, 'Mommy, don't smoke because then I wouldn't have a mom anymore.'

He cuted away the addiction.""Getting super shit-faced at a wedding, smoking probably a pack and a half that night. Next day I skipped life, including smoking, and figured I could make it two more days.

Just made up my mind to not smoke. The first three days are all hell, getting it out of your system. Then it's a mental game for the next few months.
.I haven't smoked since August 2012, and now my husband is smoke - free since January 1st.""Ooh, I can actually answer this one!

I was a smoker for about 4 years. At most I was up to about two packs a day directly after my father died, though generally I smoked about a pack a day.

One day I just thought to myself: ""This is stupid. Smoking is doing nothing for me. I get no pleasure from this, and all it does when I smoke a cigarette is make me not want a cigarette.""

From then on I just haven't done it. I won't lie and pretend it was easy, but keeping that idea at the forefront of my head -that smoking is going to do literally nothing for me but make me not want to smoke- has let me quit cold turkey relatively painlessly.

Good luck, internet person.""You absolutely have to quit because *you* want and/or need to...not because you or someone else thinks you should. It's a matter of being completely ready and determined. I was basically disgusted with my smoking when I quit and between that mindset, and an abbreviated patch regimen, I had very few issues quitting. Besides, the patch gives cool, vivid dreams. "6 days free of cigarettes right now. I wasn't a huge smoker but I definitely have strong urges to pick up just one more. It's really bad sometimes especially when I drink. My main line of defense: running. When I went running for the first time in months i was winded as a mother f*cker. It's something about running that just keeps me from smoking.   Cold turkey. Period.  "My ex was great in bed and told me that it turned him off.  he said it was like licking an ashtray.  

I was in love, so I chose that over smoking.""I had quite a few failures as well. This final time, I started slowly. 

I went a month only smoking medium cigarettes. Then went a month smoking light cigarettes. Then I went two weeks of smoking ultra lights... This whole time, I would also restrict where I could smoke. I stopped smoking in my apartment... Then my car... Then I began restricting the amount of cigarettes I'd take to work. Finally, I scheduled a two week vacation where I just stayed home and played video games non stop.

That did it for me.

I will say that I still crave cigarettes. I'll sometimes go sit next to the outside smoking section just for whiff... 

I miss it but I enjoy breathing and the added time I have...

Best of luck to you..."[deleted]I think you just really have to be ready to commit. I quit a few times over the last 7-8 years but I always went back after a few months. Then finally one day I was ready and was able to quit cold turkey. I have actually had one or two in the last two years since I quit but never wanted to pick it up like before. "I did it in steps. I started smoking only American Spirits (which claims to be less addictive). Then I cut down to only smoking them while I drank. After a few months of that, I quit completely. ""coughing up blood. i smoked for 8 years. went cold turkey that time, it was my 6th time quitting. smoke free for 6 years now. don't give up!""This Sunday, Feb 2nd, marks my 8th year since I quit. I started smoking at 14 and worked my way up to at least a pack a day. After 20 years of the habit, I decided to quit. I tried a few times before, but not seriously. 

I had three keys to quitting. Motivation, I wanted to watch my 3 year old grow up and fully participate in his life. I identified boredom, not stress, as my primary trigger. Finally, I popped Nicorette lozenges like candy. They gave me a wicked buzz but were pretty disgusting. I could use them anywhere and the effect was quick. I tried gum and patches, neither really jived (I experienced hyper-real dreams with the patch). It was also a great help that most places no longer allowed smoking. Back in the day, I could sit in a bar, smoking and drinking for hours. Money was a slight factor, though I had enough disposable income to waste on cigs (you could buy a pack for about dollar when I started and most places openly sold to kids).

I wish there was a magic formula I could give you. If there is one, it's honesty. Be honest with and accountable to yourself. I knew I could never become a ""social smoker."" I also knew I didn't have the willpower for cold turkey. Make small goals: hours, then days, weeks, months, etc. There are some great sites that detail, over time, how your lungs recover once you quit, I found this information inspiring. Save the money youÛªd spend on cigarettes in a jar. When you reach a $100, ÛÏTreat yo self!Û Keep trying until you find your keys. The right combination does exist. I loved smoking more than anything. If I can quit, you can too.""30th Birthday in a hotel room in Atlantic City, NJ.  Smoked my last one and just decided to quit.  Casino cigs are really expensive and I didn't want t o spend my 30's being chained to cigarettes.  Been nearly 3 years.  Not even a puff of one."I just relapsed after a month due to heavy stress. Any tips on avoiding this in the future?"The cost.    
Moved to Australia and the price was so much more expensive.  For a ten pack a week guy like myself it was nearly $200. I cut right back to 4pack a week,  then 2, 1 and finally none.     
It's hard,  made me cranky as hell for a few weeks,  but it's worth it. Haven't smoked in 5 years now. ""I quit by getting very angry that something had that kind of control over me, I also did it for my mom.  Note: smoking weed helps""E-cigs. I'm down from 24mg to 6 of nicotine. After buying my first starter kit, never lit up again. Get one of the more mid-range - expensive ones; the cigaretty looking ones are shit and don't do you any justice. start with a high nicotine content to get that ""kick"" you're looking for. still hooked on nicotine, but who gives a shit. Still have a few cartons of ""analogs"" that I haven't touched and just offer them to guests who smoke.
"Weed tbh. Whenever I had a craving I would smoke some weed and I did this until I just didn't find tobacco appealing. E-cigs worked for me. The Njoy Full-Flavor disposable is a good one."For me, it was about health and a possibly longer life. Each time I lit up and started smoking, I'd ask myself something along these lines - ""Would I rather smoke this cigarette or live another 10 years?"" or ""Are the few minutes I smoke this worth dying years earlier?""  Every single time I lit up, I asked these questions. Most of the time, I would end up putting it out sooner and not finishing it. After awhile, I would only take a couple drags. Soon, I just stopped lighting them.

That was the initial things that helped me. Because it was a 'choice' I kept giving myself. 

However, when I'd stopped smoking long enough and *smelled* 'smoke' for the first time in my life, I was disgusted! I couldn't believe that was how I went around smelling. I remembered one of my aunts telling me as a kid that I smelled like smoke. I had no idea what she meant. I grew up in a house of smokers and until I stopped smoking myself, was never away from smoke long enough to 'smell' it.

It's been a very long time since I stopped smoking. Every now and then, I still get the urge. Occasionally, I give in - but am quickly turned off when I get a whiff of that smell on my hands/clothes - even after just one cigarette - it's there. And then I'm over it really fast.

""I ran out of excuses having finished college. Stopped smoking, avoided bars and clubs for a few weeks (You could still smoke in them in 2003).
""I quit and restarted several times. Finally I got a horrible case of bronchitis from smoking while having a bad cold. Really really bad. So painful it wasn't painful any more.

Now I can't smoke if I even want to, and being in a smoky room makes me feel sick.

Lord knows I enjoyed smoking. I smoked a zillion cigarettes and enjoyed probably 97% of them. Smoking was an integral part of my life. Ten years later it still gnaws at me, but those days are over.""IT and gaming smoker. I used to sit down in from on the computer and play games like WoW and Counter-Strike for hours while chain-smoking. And clients are stressful. Cigarettes let me go outside so I could silently and sadly think of ways of telling them to go fuck themselves.

What made me stop? Snus.
What made me stop using Snus? Expensive as fuck... and it was easier to quit than cigarettes. Snus kind of helped me ween off. There are also studies showing that Snus is much less damaging to the body because of how it is produced (the real stuff I imported from sweden, anyway).

I tried Allen Carr's stop smoking method, and it's good. It helped realize the silliness of it all. But it didn't get rid of the itch. And the itch won a couple of times.

Nicotine free for...8 months now? I don't know, it kind of just happened. The hassle of getting snus shipped in just didn't seem worth it.""I was driving home from seeing my boyfriend, now husband, and just decided I was not going to smoke anymore.  Some how that worked.""Nicotine patches and lots of food.  I got around the work craving by just going outside and walking around the building or drinking tea.  Mints helped too.  You just have to get through the first week, then it becomes easier.  I've done it twice (and I smoked a lot, like a pack a day).  Also, don't even consider having a single drag ever again.  If you have one drag, you'll start smoking regularly again.  Just get in the mindset that you'll never touch a cigarette again.  It helps to get rid of all cigarettes, ashtrays, lighters and other reminders of smoking from your entire home.""Simple: I decided that I would only quit once. It worked, and, frankly, wasn't that hard."Time.."After trying to quit many times I finally found a way. I wasn't just addicted to nicotine, I was also addicted to all the other crap in cigarettes.  
  
I started rolling my own cigarettes but then found out the papers have lots of chemicals as well. I started using RAW 100% hemp rolling papers and organic additive free tobacco (American Spirit). I used that to wean myself off of cigarettes. I also found if I smoked a manufactured cigarette during this time that I would get much stronger cravings.

Hope someone actually sees this post...""It's worth noting the amazing response rate on this thread.  People who have quit are usually incredibly proud of it, and eager to help others dothe same.  The take-away is to just do it.  It is well worth the effort.

The second time, I quite cold turkey, but I also started working out regularly. Whenever I felt the urge for a cigarette, I just stopped to really think about it and about how it truly affected me. My lungs, my skin, my teeth, the smell in my clothes and on my hands...all of it. Usually this turned me off enough to skip it and just move on. 

This stuck and lasted with me. I have, on a very rare occasion, smoked a cigarette here or there, but I always feel terrible about it after and have no desire to do it again on the regular. I haven't been a regular smoker now for 7 years. I have smoked 3 cigarettes on different occasions in those 7 years and didn't really enjoy any of them. So, I guess you could say it worked.""In all honesty, I got pregnant. Quit the day I found out I was, cold turkey. It's been over a year and of course there was an occasion craving but never gave in and it's been easier then I expected. I suppose I did have other things on my mind at the time. ""poverty, my health was seriously starting to get fucked up (trouble breathing in the morning) and the patch. thank lord jeesus of latter day saints that someone invented the patch""I woke up one day and I started coughing and out came a loogy made of blood. Apparently, the smoking has been drying up my lungs and every morning when it is cold, my lungs have no room to breathe.""Was bed ridden for almost two weeks due to a bad case of bronchitis.  When I finally felt well enough to even consider nicotine again I thought it was as good as a time as ever to stop, as the worst of the withdraw cravings would have passed while I was laying sick in bed. 

This was 7 years ago.""**Nicotine mints** - *except that I've been on them for five years.* I recently tried to quit the mints with the patches and I guess I started too low of a dosage. (14mg) I was a train wreck - Raging one sec and on the verge of emotional breakdown the next. I was like that for 14 days straight. Though an e-mail conversation with my SO (we weren't talking b/c I was being a moody little _itch) we agreed that would go back on the mints (2mgs -8-10 x's a day), regroup and try again on the higher dosage of patches once the US school year is over. I believe that I am still better off with the mints over cigs since the other toxins aren't present. Mouth cancer is still a concern for me. "I heard somewhere that cancer cures smoking.E-cigs!! So I'm not sure if you can consider that quitting..."For me it was vaping. Tastes so much better, doesnt leave that horrid smell or after taste, and is still satisfying. 

For my father, it was being diagnosed with diabetes and having heart surgery. He quit the that second. ""I havent had a smoke in 15 days now so I am on my way but I cant say that I have totally quit yet as I have a long road ahead of me.  I also quit an everyday weed habit 15 days ago so that made it even harder.  I had two reasons: First, health, I woke up 15 days ago with the flu and it was absolutely horrible.  I was out of service for two days (to the point where I couldn't even have a smoke if I wanted to).  Second, during those two days, I started adding up how much money I smoke away each month and it added up to $450 between smokes and weed.  Once I realized that I was smoking away a PS4 every month, I just had to try.  Im putting the money away each day that I would have spent and I am going to reward myself with a PS4 after 30 days.  Maybe buy some components to put together a nice gaming PC after 90 days.  I have a friend who put the money that he would have spent on smokes in a bank account each day and each year he uses the $3650 to take his family on vacation for a reward.  He is on his 5th year now.  I have been a smoker for 15 years so it definitely had a noticeable effect on my lungs.  Even just after the 15 days, I can now take a deep breath without coughing.  Its pretty awesome.""Honestly? Getting pregnant. My SO hasn't quit, but he doesn't smoke around me. I can't stand the smell now after he comes in from a cigarette, but I let it go." i quit drinking."I started dating my now wife. When I expressed my interest in her over the phone she said the feelings were mutual and she wanted to come and see me.  I was so excited that I chain smoked my last two cigarettes then used mouth wash, cough drops, toothpaste, chewing gum and a spritz of vodka to mask the smell.  2.5 years later, I haven't smoked since.

I was already a social smoker though.  Smoked a pack a day for 10 years, then quit for a year only to cave in when out with friends.  The first time i quit for over a year, i used comfort food to quit. Any time i wanted a smoke i just ate something wonderful to pass the cravings.  That worked well for me, but alcohol made me not care if i smoked or not.

Today, I weigh 60 lbs less than when i did when i smoked, and i used crap food to kickstart the process.  So don't let weight gain be an excuse, as it is only that, an excuse."A massive amount of MDMA"DON'T STOP QUITTING UNTIL YOU CAN STAY QUIT!!!  On my final attempt, I decided that a)I would make staying stopped my first priority, over everything else. If I had to go home ""sick"", because I had to go concentrate on not smoking, I would...although, once I made that decision, I didn't have to. (didn't feel guilty, because I was sick so often from bronchitis/asthma, etc, I figured it was a good trade off)  b) I decided I would try EVERYTHING anyone recommended. On some cancer website there's a list of, like, 100 things to do to help stop-- I tried them all. Some worked, some were ""meh"" for me, but I tried everything. I took the stop smoking class (via the cancer society) 3 times-- most useful piece of info: most of us do not suddenly stop, it takes a few times. You aren't a loser because you've started, just...begin again to quit. Each time gets you a little closer to, ""I'm so sick of this shit"".
C) Just...keep.... trying!!! (I've been smoke free for 8 years now, feels GREAT, I love being able to stay healthy, hike, and every time I ring up someones purchases and watch the chu-ching of money money money, I'm glad I stuck with it. Good luck!
""Working out and wanting to loose weight. I was 300+ lbs (I am only 6'1)  and inactive and a smoker. I started working out (tons of cardio), and had a thought in my head... if I want to lose weight, I have to do cardio, if I smoke cardio will suck. Thus I had to quit smoking... I am now 180lbs have been a year and 5 months clean of smoking.  ""When I was really ready to make a change in my life.

I stopped smoking several times before that for other people but it never stuck.

Went from 2 packs a day to not with cold turkey, gum and the patch help slow it down, but will was the only thing that carried me the distance. ""I started playing hobby sports more often. (Airsoft in particular ) It encouraged me to workout and excercise. Took my mind off of it for a bit and tired myself down to the point of exhaustion. 
Using electronic cigarettes somewhat helped, but I didn't rely on it. Before I excercised, I smoked so much electronic cigs but it didnt give me the buzz I needed. All it did was screw up my throat. 

Work and school are the hardest places.. seriously. Break time was my smoke time. I remember my worst time was when I intentionally left my pack at home a couple times and almost broke down during break time because no one in my class smoked. 

That when a friend introduced me to electronic cigs and it came in handy. I carry a vape now with nicotine in it to ease myself. Plus you dont smell like smoke when you go back in. 

Every little step of success is progress. Lessen the cig each day. If you can't try to make a pack per week. then less and less. fill it in with vape or running or socializing more. 

It's been months since my last cig. ( Vaping right now thinking about it... ) Dont let it control you. Best of luck friend. 

""A sharp pain in my chest, that can't have been from all the vitamins that tobacco was providing.
Cold turkey after that 3.5 years ago.""My dad grew up on a tobacco farm, and he smoked for around 35 years. He tried Chantix, the patches, gum, just about everything. He needed to quit because of heart problems, but nothing worked. His doctor recommended he get hypnotized, and he was really hesitant, but it worked. He quit cold turkey and hasn't had a cigarette in 3 years. ""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO0qwl5k9R4 

This video is a pretty good motivator. ""Got so used to smoking cigs while on opiates, once i kicked the dope I could not smoke cigs anymore.""I just literally stopped one day. No fancy gums, tricks or any other bull shit. Just will power. That's all you need.""I quit about 10 years ago, after smoking for two 5 year stints. Trick is to keep trying to quit. I tried at least 5 different ways, ended up spending more time trying to quit than normally smoking. I think I just got to a point where it worked out - it ended up being a cold turkey with a few nicotine gums to ease it through. After quitting I started to dream I was smoking, and wake up guilty :(. 

Anyway, now I can have a smoke once every 6 months or so at a wedding, or super messy night out without any problems. The next morning my mouth feels like a filthy ashtray and I feel guilty again :)

Just keep trying man - you'll figure it out, its different for everyone""I'm WAY to late to this party, but basically if you do it you have to do it immediately. None of the, ""ill just finish this pack"" nonsense. If you're seriously ready to quit you will not want to pick up another one in that moment. Another thing to keep in mind is to not take failure too seriously, if you fall off the bike wait until you're ready and get back on. And as far as not smoking just see how long you can go. Don't think about quitting forever as that can be really daunting. Just think about how many hours, days, or weeks you've gone without one and how you do not want to make up that time again.

But the number one thing that motivated me to quit is this: Almost EVERYBODY has smoked at least one time or another in their life. And not only that but everybody could smoke if they wanted to. So a majority of the people that don't smoke now had to quit at one time or another, might as well do it right now. 

Good luck""Throw away your smokes, lighter and ashtrays. Don't light up ever again. 3 days of hell. After a week you'll feel really good. Hang in there.

Come on over to r/ecig.  We've got some awesome follks with great info that are always willing to help!""Stop telling yourself that it's any more than a habit. Telling yourself it's an addiction only helps you justify not quitting. I find that with anything challenging, i can't tell myself it's hard or i will fail. I have to tell myself it's easy, so easy that failure would be the most embarrassing thing i can imagine. This mindset has helped me lift more weight, run 20km obstacle courses, finish my degree and get through 2 weeks of nightshift at work. All of these things were big struggles for me only a couple of years ago simply because i told myself it was hard, it was a challenge etc etc ""Probably too late to help, but for what it's worth I tried a multitude of times and failed on each.

When the gubment made cloves illegal in the U.S., I smoked them up until the day I could no longer find them.

By then, I was sick of smoking the hookah and smoking in general. As far as drinking, that was the hardest part of quiting. After a night of drinking I would come home and smoke hookah.

When I quit smoking I didn't drink for 1 month to guarantee control and slip ups from not happening. I also had got into working out consistently for a few years and that really helps too. You never want to smoke after lifting weights or a run.""All seriousness, I stopped smoking cigs when I stopped drinking booze and smoking bud. For me, couldn't have one without the other, and when the other (weed or booze) was gone, I had no desire or reason to smoke cigs. I tried a few, but I couldn't see only smoking cigs as a viable option. They do nothing for me sober, but when I'm intoxicated, they give me something to do, and I would do things I'm not proud of to get them.""I had just built up a tolerance to smoking, and it just didn't feel good, anymore.

The idea of quitting seemed so daunting because I'd been endlessly reassured that this would be a herculean task. As to my actual method, I spent one month weening: 15 a day the first week, 10 the second, 5 the third, and 3 the fourth (had been pack a day). The most surprising thing was that when it came down to it, I freaked out the first day, but that was it. The anticipation was the hardest part, but actually not smoking was not all that hard, just decided it was something I could no longer do. Was grumpy for about a week then over it. I still occasionally miss the reprieve of having one before work, or during work, or at a big event or occasion, but as a daily habit it was no big deal to quit because I didn't view it as such.""My wife offered me a blowjob everyday I didn't smoke for 6 weeks.

It was Christmas Eve, earlier that day I was at work thinking ""man, I don't really want to smoke anymore, please help me with this.""  Later that evening I went out for a smoke, and started hiccuping as soon as I started.  When I went back inside the hiccups were gone.  A few hours later I went back out, the same thing happened.  I decided that was my last cigarette.  It wasn't, maybe 8 months later I bought a pack, had about 6 within 2 hours, then threw the pack out of my car on the way home.

Then being admitted to hospital for chest pains. He gave himself asthma in the 8 years he was smoking. The doctors thought it was lung cancer. So understandably he was scared shitless and gave up over new year. 

His way of doing it though, was to do it with someone else. His family in his case. So him and his dad are using electric cigarettes now. Getting over the cravings is hard, yes, but if someone is going  through the same thing with you, it becomes more bearable. Also it gives you motivation to stick to it. ""Grape juice.

I knew deep down, in my heart of hearts, that I would one day do whatever I was trying to quit. It was just a matter of time. I knew that deep down I didn't really want to quit. It wasn't until actually wanted to stop,  that it was a lot easier. ""I quit after a long weekend of out of town partying. It almost felt like an out of body experience where I was looking down at myself from about 15 feet above, lighting up a cigarette early morning with little planned for the remainder of the day.

It was the middle of summer and started to make some positive lifestyle choices, finished college, thinned out some fringe 'friends'. 
I can't attribute it to anything I can put my finger on, but that morning I kind of just took an introspective look at my life and decided to go a better direction with it. ""Will power.

Today I still smoke every once in a while when I drink. I don't drink often, and I don't have cravings of any kind after a night of drinking and smoking.

The trick is, just buy the strongest one and cut slices off if you don't need the whole thing. It's much less expensive this way.

Also be careful also about using too much or you may vomit. 

So, gradually the patch that you have on gets used up over a day or so, so you naturally taper off. You will probably take the old one off and maybe the next slice you put on will be a little smaller. And so on. 

The nice thing also is that once you are on the patch you have essentially quit smoking. You could stay on it indefinitely and still reap the health benefits of quitting. But in reality, you will basically probably taper off over time.

Also, if you every get hit with cravings some time after you have quit, or you are going to a bar or some tempting situation, just go grab a piece of patch and stick it on. Problem solved.

He can walk away from cigarettes, but not his dip.""I'm about 6 days smoke free. I got a cold, and for the first few days, I didn't crave cigarettes. Hell, if I was home, I was generally knocked out on Nyquil anyways. Once I realized it had been a couple of days, I figured I might as well keep going. It still sucks, but at least I'm past the physical addiction.

So if you wanna quite, start hanging out with sick people, take a few sick days off from work, and just take a bunch of Nyquil.

But seriously, this sucks. Good luck.""Waited a long time to tell this story, and not me (but my dad). 

The answer is: a heart attack.

It was 1997. I was 16 and the oldest of 3; my dad was 46. By his own admission, he LIKED smoking. Though he didn't like the stains on the white walls or his teeth, he enjoyed going outside and being alone to de-stress a few times a day. He was heading in to work one day and started feeling tingly, and short of breath on his walk in to the parking lot. He thought, ""I'm having a heart attack"", and briefly considered finishing the walk into the building so he could get to his office and call 911. ""Something"" told him not to, but to get back in his car and drive the half-mile to our family doctor's office. [yes, terrible idea]. He arrived at the receptionist's desk at the clinic and said ""I'm having a heart attack"", and passed out. He woke up in the hospital -- a different place than where he'd remembered arriving.

After stabilizing him, the doctors had put in a stent (via balloon catheterization) to hold open the 95% clogged artery. When the doctors found out he was a smoker, they advised him that if he quit smoking, immediately, today, his chances of another heart attack within 5 years was about 5%. If he had ONE cigarette, his chances of NOT having a heart attack in 5 years was about 10% (because, like Pringles, you can never have just one cigarette). These numbers may not be accurate but it's what I remember from nearly 17 years ago.

Dad described having a heart attack as ""an elephant sitting on your chest"", and when an elephant sits on your chest, ""it gets your attention quickly."" He quit cold turkey, and hasn't had a cigarette (or heart attack) since. I'm now 32, he's just turned 63, and me and my extant siblings . . . plus two more that have come along since . . . have all gotten a lot more years with him because he survived a heart attack that motivated him to stop smoking.

I hope you don't need similar motivation, but it would probably work if you survived it.

P.S., my mom didn't find any similar motivation, and smoked for another 15 years. She quit 2 years ago, using e-cigarettes, and is to 0mg now (but still uses the e-cig because she ""has to have something to do with her hands""). She sits in the living room and looks like that caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland.""I stopped after taking Champix. I have heard of stories of people losing it and killing their families while taking this stuff. It also gives you very vivid dreams which didnt affect me. I smoked for 20 odd years and I haven't had a cigarette for ~6 years or so.
What got me to the point of wanting to quit was when I couldnt even climb the stairs in our home without being out of breathe. 

The major thing though is that if you really truly in your heart dont want to quit, nothing will help you.""Taking the stairs wherever I could and for as long as I could. I would walk up and down stairs until I couldn't breathe, and it killed the urge and got me thru the withdrawal. It is one of the hardest things to break from, but don't give up! You can do it! My boyfriend is trying to quit right now, and I do not nag him or give him a hard time - he is a grown man and can make his own decisions, but I have to say, he is really doing great. Its hard as hell, don't give up because the victory is that much better when you get to your goal! Good for you!""My trigger was being at work too. My SO wanted me to quit because it was effecting my health. So we went cold turkey together. I didn't succeed too well. As a lot of my friends in the office were smokers and it was an unbelievably stressful environment to work in. Then I got fired (under questionable reasons). Problem solved. In fact it was several problems solved.

Joking aside, I found that the first two weeks were the hardest. Now I like that I can look back and think I've not had a smoke for 5 months. It makes me feel proud to be able to say/think that.""I added up how much smoking was costing me, made a lot of wishlists/dream boards, and bought myself stuff as rewards for every milestone. Dinner, booze, and new shoes :):) also treating 60-70 year old patients on oxygen who cant do anything anymore because they have COPD, emphsema, etc."Commenting so I can come back to this post. Great thread!"The E-Cig helped me. I got a flavor I liked and kept it charged, also refused to buy cigarets. Told myself it wasn't an option. After a while I couldn't even take a drag of a real cigaret without wanting to vomit. I'd smoke less and less of the E, forget to charge it, eventually I went days without it and now I've been smoke free for 2 years this April :) "Heart Attack at 56 yrs old. Been almost a year. Told the EMT guys I quit on the way to the hospital :). Hope you are successful. My way sucked for me and more so my family that I scared very bad.Take one cigarette a day with you and when you light up just take two puffs off of it and the put it out and put it back in your package.  One or two puffs are really all it takes to satisfy the urge.  I smoked Camel straights for 45 years and this is how I stopped 9 years ago.  After about a week of doing this you will find that you are really weaning yourself off of them and you will also get tired of doing it and quit."Just plain ol' deciding to quit. And telling your family about what you've decided and what you're about to go through. Don't milk it for sympathy, just talk to them about it. I couldn't look at my daughter anymore without feeling guilty beyond belief.

It sucked. It was cold, hot, sweaty, shivering, anxious, miserable, enraging death for about two days. Then on the third day it was all the above minus the actual death feeling. On the seventh day I had a fit of the DTs and was so sick I had to call into work. About two weeks after that I was in the clear, still slightly stunned feeling, a dull shock that didn't seem to ebb away completely, but the actual pain was gone for good.

There's no secret. There are practical things you can do to help yourself along, but just not smoking is the most brutally simple way to put it. 

Drink juice. Fruit juice, cut half and half with water, ***fucking constantly***. Sip it, nip it. Keep your glucose up. When you quit your metabolism is going to crash. You will gain weight, it's not just a matter of not binging on junk food. Your metabolism will slow and you will gain weight. You can attenuate this with lots of grains, and shitloads of veggies and fruits. Eat well, walk about an hour per day ideally, 30 minutes at least, and you will be ok.

I don't miss it. I think about it plenty, but I wanted to quit nearly every day my last five years as a smoker, and it only gets harder to do so the longer you do it.

Hydrate, fruits, juice, nuts, crunchy veggies, walking. 

You have to give a shit. And suffer. And then you will be free.""A friend and employee of mine went into heart failure, he was 23 years old. He was a daily smoker, as was I, off and on for about 10 years. When he got back to work, I quit with him, solidarity, you know? It wasn't just for him, but he was a catalyst. It has been about 15 months since my last cigarette, and his stupid ass smokes every day again.""I took Chantix, which was terrifying because I thought for sure I was going to get these horrific nightmares and kill myself. I didn't get any nightmares but I got these crazy (awesome) dreams. I also moved home, got a new job, and new friends. :)""Had a bubble on my gum one morning. Went to the dentist ASAP. Turns out it was the beginning, serious, signs of gum disease. He drained the puss and i still need surgery on it to prevent it happening constantly (which it does). I now have one ""dead"" tooth where the bubble was. Went cold turkey after hearing that. I used vapor pens for a while but now am clean for almost 2 years."Chantix. "Got five years.
Decided I was better then smoking.
Made a rule, if I smoked a cig... I had to eat the butt.
Never smoked again, and now when I say I gonna do something, I do it.
Smoking made me a worthless sack of shizz.

God bless all you smokers who still smoke!

One day you'll realize your better than that crap.

One day you'll leave it behind, and quit running away from life and embrace it!

Vaporizers seem to help... But who the F knows what's in those things.

Drink water, exercise, love, & live healthy!






""Having a kid.  First time she was old enough to ask me what I was doing, about 3.""I was a smoker for roughly 12 years, one day i decided to quit before it was too late. I threw out everything smoking related. Ash Trays, Every single pack of cigarette i could find, and i also made sure to wash and clean all the things that usually start smelling like cigarette smoke after a while. I only had to avoid buying cigarettes, which wasn't that hard. But no matter what you do it really comes down to willpower. I did succeed in quitting smoking from one day to another. And i haven't touched a cigarette since.""Just quitting. Everyone has their own tips or secrets. Mine was that I just wanted to. I did it for me, not for my family or my girlfriend or the asshole at the grocery store telling me to quit, no... I did it for me. And every time I wanted a smoke, I asked myself, ""will you regret it later?"" And the answer was always yes. After 6 years of smoking, went cold Turkey, no patches, gum, or pills, and I'm going on 21 months without a full cigarette. I say full, because I definitely allowed myself a few slip ups, especially while drinking, but never sober and never more than 2 drags. It's all about impulse control and having people around who understand you're doing fucking shitty, and that's okay because you won't always be like this and it's not their fault.""Ex-smoker for almost 2 years now, one day I randomly, and I mean super randomly, decided I was going to quit. I had this strong sense of not wanting to smoke, so right then I threw out my cigarettes, not wanting them around me to intice me. 

After that I used more gum and mints than you can imagine, I found wintergreen gum and mints gave me the feeling in the back of your throat you get when you smoke. After about 3ish weeks I weened myself off the mints and gum and have never looked back. 

The hardest thing to do is to actually 100 percent commit to quitting, once you do that it becomes a lot easier. ""I was and still am going through a period in my life where I am trying my hardest to be honest with myself and others. Then I just kept telling myself that there's a big difference between quitting and trying to quit. So I quit, cold turkey. ""I had to do it cold turkey. No patch or gum or anything like that. I did learn to crochet, though, and that definitely helped with the whole not knowing what to do with my hands part of it. Made a big ass blanket. Took about a month, but by the end of it the cravings really had stopped.""I woke up one day with a sore throat and decided not to smoke for the entire day. I wasn't craving for it or anything, I just wanted to recover from that itch in my throat. 

I followed through the next day and was pleased that I've managed to suppress the cravings for 2 days now. Decided to challenge myself not to smoke until the weekends and maybe reward myself with a huge premium steak. 

Weekend past, steak eaten, I decided to keep my non-smoking run going. After the 1 month period, I told all my friends and family that I'm on the verge of stopping. They laughed but I made it known to them by crushing all my cigarettes and smoking peripherals in the chute. 

Until now, I'm 2 years smoke free and I couldn't be happier about it. Before this, I've tried stopping for 3 times after smoking for 8 years; through rationing, nicotine patch and vaping, none of it works. The most effective way is just deciding and coming to a realization that I need to stop this bad habit of mine. It's tough with all the cravings and sudden onset of fever when going cold turkey but you just need to be mentally strong to not fall back into that nasty vice. "I switched to hard drugsVashhheeenI used hypnotherapy. After 3 sessions I simply didn't want to smoke any more. It cost me $75 per session. Well worth it imo."I read that if you go 3 days without smoking then the nicotine is no longer in your body and the addiction is no longer chemical, but mental. I decided that if I go 3 days then I would just convince myself not to smoke anymore.

That's what I did. No nicotine gum or patch, I just decided not to smoke anymore and this has worked for me. I now have no desire to smoke and have been a quitter for 5 years."Fiance's mother died of lung cancer.  I was an 8 year smoker prior to that.Sign up for a half-marathon and start training.  It helped me finally stop smoking all together. Even one cigarette would mess up my run the next day. "Electronic cigarette with a flavor you actually love.  I tried a LOT before I found one that worked b/c nothing fulfilled that need for ""smoke in the lungs"" (and my smoking mj really helped that craving, if that's an option for you I'd certainly look into it).  I found a good rich earthy flavor for the e-cig (Superskunk by alienvapor.com if you're interested, it does NOT taste like MJ, but it's a good rich earthy flavor I found NONE Of the tobacco flavors were even close to what I was wanting), and kept my mouth busy with sunflower seeds (this satisfied the ""hand to mouth"" need/habit).  You have to toss your regular cig's and resign yourself to NOT BUYING MORE, it's will power man, pure will power.""Anger.
Tried quitting for years and kept relapsing.
20 odd years ago I went to the hospital that had a quit smoking group and was told there was no places left... Stomped off and threw the remaining cigs in a bin.
Toughed it out... cold turkey. 
Just took it a ""craving"" at a time.

Plus I was coughing up blood in the mornings towards the end so knew I had to really lose the habit.""Stop smoking when in a car. It works miracles
""I was born into a family of smokers. I said I would never smoke. Famous last words. I smoked just like everyone else. Even after taking care of my Grandfather with mouth and esophageal cancer...I still smoked. It wasn't until a box of diapers cost less than a box of cigarettes that I stopped smoking. *Great reason*
  ""I was going through divorce with my first wife, and the woman who would become my second wife asked me to stop smoking while we were on a drive because she didn't like it.

I threw the smokes out the window.""A friend of mine is currently testing out a theory, that if you have an addiction start doing shitty versions of it. He too is trying to quit smoking so he bought a big bag of the cheapest, rankest pipe tobacco he could find and is hoping that by the end of the bag, he'll never want to smoke again. 

I personally don't think it will work, but you never know!""Snus! Its a Nor/Swe thing. Its a type of smokeless tobacco that is packed in a little pouch that you put under your lip. It's not cheaper then cigaretts, but defenetly healtier!!! Just order a can from any website that ships worldwide.""when I realized that quitting was the easy part. it takes no time, no effort, no nothin' to just quit. that is easy. the hard part is accepting that youve quit. for some reason, making the distinction that my struggle was actually with ""accepting that i quit smoking"" instead of ""quitting smoking"", worked like a charm. i quit as soon as i realized that - and now i spend my time accepting that. :) ""This will probably be buried, but actually weed. I actually smoked weed before cigs, and I picked up cigs for during work of when I didn't have bud, and I would dip too. Then when I was having trouble walking from class to my car I knew it was time to quit. So I switched to dip but that was almost worse than cigs for me so when I had a really bad craving I would just smoke a little bud. It would take the edge off and was healthier and in a couple months I just didnt even want to touch cigs at all. Last time I smoked one was maybe about a year or two ago""The blu ecig. I got one and started using that. I always had it in my pocket for my quick nic fits. Then after 2 weeks, I used it less and less until I forgot it at home and didn't notice. ""A hitter box. Every time you want a cig, blast a hitter instead. Pretty soon you wont need the cigs. I used schwag so it tasted horrible, and did nothing. Just like cigs!""One morning in 1998, I said ""I will put off my next cigarette for 15 minutes."" I did that consciously for about a week and haven't smoked since. "chantix worked for me. It's now 3 years later no smoking."Seems I'm in the minority, but I actually enjoyed quitting with patches. It helps you recognize the difference between a mental craving and a nicotine craving. Wait til you are nic fitting and slap on a patches. Fit shuts up but your habits are still there, so while the physical cravings are low, you'll still want one when you drive or drink. You'll still need willpower for the mental part, but the mental cravings are the hard part anyway, and it takes a while to relearn to do some things without a cig.

Bonus story for patches is the insanely vivid dreams you'll have if you sleep with a patch on.""For me it was taking advantage of a low stress period of time. (for me it was winter break) During that time I didn't have to focus on school work, so the massive effort mental down time I suffered from quitting wasn't hurting me. This, combined with the fact that I repeatedly and constantly told my friends my quitting plan, really helped. Also, reading Allen Carr's book helps better understand the struggle that's going on in your body and mind. Also I had been trying to quit for about a year before I was successful. 

"a really sweet tooth infection and the price of smokes in LA"TL;DR: Stress. And *actually* wanting to quit for yourself and not because anyone else says so or wants you to. Say ""No"" to yourself having a cigarette when you want one the most.

I never told my family I smoked. They probably knew, but I still kept it hidden from them. Luckily, I started not long before moving out of my parent's place, so I didn't have to actually hide it for long. A few years later though, one of my great aunts died. We didn't consider her distant at all; my sister and I grew up seeing her quite often when we were young and she was a fantastic person and we had fond memories of her. She died about 2 years ago and the memorial service was at this sort of overnight lodge place outside of Houston (we live in Austin). So, I went with my family for the weekend and didn't take any cigarettes with me since I hadn't ever told them that I smoked.

Well, the whole family and extended family were there, and we were (of course) all drinking the night before the actual service after we had dinner and standing around talking. There were a number of smokers there from the extended part of the family (a lot of which I did actually know; not like a bunch of half-cousins I had heard about and never met or anything). They were all outside by the fire pit smoking and drinking, and I went to hang out with them with my drink. I came really close to asking one for a cigarette and not caring that my family would have seen me smoking, but I held back.

That first time I denied myself a cigarette was because I didn't want my family to see me. But after that, I had the realization that, ""It was incredibly easy for me to say 'No' for all those years before I started smoking. So, why the hell did I ever think it was hard to say 'No' while I was smoking? Oh, that's right - because I didn't *actually* want to quit yet. Now I do."" And that was that.

I've even been drunk at parties and kept someone else's cigarette alive with a couple puffs without inhaling. Still haven't actually smoked a cigarette since February 2012.

So, just remember, you can only quit for yourself. But I would highly recommend doing it right at your most stressful moment. Denying yourself a cigarette when you want it the *most* makes every denial after that as easy as breathing was before you started smoking."I once watched a Documentary film about how James Woods got himself to quit smoking. He hired the services of an agency that helped people to stop their nicotine addiction. They had employees follow him around to monitor his habits to see if he would smoke or not. Then if he was caught they would kidnap and torture someone he cared about in front of his eyes until he successfully quit. I learned a lot from this film."Actually being ready to quit. One night I was just done, gave away the rest of my pack and never went back.""While for some quitting cold turkey works it seems as though most still think about smoking. For myself and my husband, we were ready and went to see out doctor. She gave us each a RX for Chantix which is a nicotine blocker and per research is more successful than other aids and the cold turkey method. (I know this from the research conducted 3 years ago when we quit.) The first week you can smoke but it starts to taste bad and the drive to smoke dissipates. After a month and some wild vivid dreams we were done and an added bonus is not having to fight that ""I still want a cigarette feeling"" as described by those who quit cold turkey. Just my story everyone is different. All I know is this worked for us. ""This will probably get buried deed deep down but here goes:

What worked for me: sports! I started going to self defense lessons using a very popular fighting system: Krav Maga. The training sessions were so intense that after 10-15 minutes in I felt like somebody kicked me in the chest and that I needed more air. I held on to that sensation and each time I needed to smoke I would remember that moment when I was barely able to breath. I haven't touched a cig since. "I tried acid. The cigarette then tasted like I was forcefully inhaling a mixture of dirt and hatred. Haven't wanted one since.Electronic cigarettes and nicotine gumLiar!"Realizing with every cigarette I smoked, I was making a conscious decision that in all likelihood would end my life sooner than necessary.""Cold turkey. I tried gums, rationing, and repeating many times. What finally worked was I set it up to have my last one late Sunday night before bed. Had it... then threw out ash trays, lighters, even the empty box. I then proceeded to keep myself super busy with work, exercise,  travel, etc. Anything to keep from having downtime to sneak one in. After a few days of perpetual burning myself out the cravings began to get weaker and I was fine. Except for a cigar at new year's I haven't smoked since the 3rd Sunday in July 2013. "Get a really big e-cig and fill it with juice with the highest nicotene level. To start out with anyway. Those things mean business "You have to understand that addiction is like a sliding weight that is propped up the more you use. As you use less, the weight falls back down and you will eventually crave less. There is an inherent time delay in the cravings vs the height of the weight, i.e., takes a bit for the weight to drop if you stop using. Hence, using any type of nicotine supplement props the weight up and does not achieve the final goal of letting it fall back to zero, where you don't crave nicotine. You have to just stop and mentally battle through the cravings and the mental issues associated with them, which can be difficult. You will falter, just keep cutting back. Eventually, you won't even want a cigarette. It is ultimately a mental battle that you either force yourself to win or die of cancer (possibly). "new years resolution....lol. my baby girl was born on the 2nd. 28 days. she made it easy."distanced myself from other smokers (not hard since most friends dont smoke).. used to live with a smoker and no longer do, that helped... 

Once I was away from other smokers quitting was easy"I'm not sure this applies to everyone but I could not get addicted to them now matter what and how much of it I smoked I found it tedious and time consuming and dirty and asked myself why am I continuing this if it doesn't get me addicted "Shame - I smoked 2 packs a day for 18 years. Then I went to a super ritzy beach wedding of one of my best friends. 250 people and I was the only smoker. His sister made a point of coughing at me and making me feel like a jackass.

Got back home, and quit that week. Tried using patches a couple days, then forgot one day, and realized that I was just done with it. I no longer saw myself as a smoker, and something about that made me just no longer feel like I needed it.""Smoked for 8years, 16-24yrs. Got real sick one night, sweated balls so much I flooded my iPod. I thought to myself, if this is what dying feels like, than fuck that! I stopped the next day. It's hard but put simply, if you don't buy cigs than you won't smoke cigs. It's been just about two years now, the smell still makes my body tingle, I just don't smoke. I still regret that I wasn't stronger to quit sooner.  ""I bought a packet and threw it away after having only one, only you can know you are ready to give up smoking. If you make excuses and say oh I will give up after this pack then you are most defiantly not ready to quit. Find what is keeping you hooked and fix that that's what I did. 
Every time your tempted buy a pack and just throw it away in the bin. It feels great I quit at the age of 21 I had been smoking since I was 15, I'm now 35. "Winter in Wisconsin. Stood outside and said f this. Quit and never looked back. "I firmly believe that the notion that ""quitting smoking is the hardest thing you will ever do"" is some nonsense that the Tobacco industry came up with to make relapsing smokers not feel so bad about being ""unable to quit"".

Quitting smoking is hard because it's *soooo* available.

And yes, there are biological factors at play.

But the way I quit was one day I just said ""I'm sick of the smell. I'm sick of the hatred from non-smokers. I *want to* do this, and I *can* do this. And my willpower is strong enough to do this.""

And a few days later, I was pretty much over it.

My friends who have had trouble with quitting had trouble because they didn't really want to quit - they were quitting for external reasons.

And yeah, if you don't *really* want to quit, and goddam there's cigarettes and other smokers all over the place... Then yeah, it's really hard to do something you don't *really* want to do, especially when it's that available."I manned the fuck up after 2 packs a day and just quit.I was only doing 1-1/2 packs but that's what I did as well. Just don't smoke another one. 37 years and I've cheated a total of twice while drinking. Can't stand the smell now. "One book... read it once, I've been 4 years smoke free.

I successfully converted to e-cigarettes, literally just stopped smoking one day and carried on with some lemon flavour."I was really broke and had to choose between smokes and food.  Food won."My wife and I decided to have kids.  We both smoked and decided that if we were going to have kids then we had to quit smoking.  I smoked for over 20 years averaging between a half and full pack a day.  To help with the cravings I went on a nicotine patch.  DO NOT smoke while on the patch.  During the early quitting stages, I was playing ball and my patch must've fallen off.  About 3 hours passed and I thought it would be ok to have a cig with my beer after the game with the boys.  I almost fucking died.  Last cigarette I ever had.  So to recap, kids, patch, near death experience all helped me kick the habit.  Easy, right?"Sunflower seeds and dum dum lollipops.  Every time I ga craving I would alternate between the two.  I quit in a week but gained some weight. "Cold Turkey.  I tried patches, I tried smoking one less cigarette than the day before, I tried Zyban.  I had to just go for it and quit.  I have remained a non smoker for7 years by considering myself a recovering nicotine addict.

Every time I ga craving I would alternate between the two.  I quit in a week but gained some weight. "I smoked 20-30 a day for 6 years. My answer is the right motivation. I tried giving up with patches, then other forms of nicotine replacement therapy, and resorted back to smoking every time ( about 4 failed attempts in total). Then one day, I was walking up the stairs to my apartment and my heart went crazy and I was out of breath and felt really weird. Immediately after that, I craved a cigarette. From that moment, I went cold turkey and haven't touched one since. I truly believe quitting nicotine is a mental battle. 

Nicotine replacement therapy is not quitting, it's marginally better than smoking, but you're still addicted to the substance. I know many a person that still use nicotine replacement therapy years later and can't stop. If you really want to stop, and are determined to, then you'll do it.

Another point is treating it as a proper addiction. You will always be a nicotine addict, and so can't touch cigarettes again or you will relapse.""4 months smoke free here. its hard to say, but it 'clicked' for me. I was at a point where i wanted to quit sincerely. Im 31 and it was a mind fuck for me that i smoked for half my life, kinda made me sick. And on top of that smoking was starting to hurt. So with those 2 things, I just dove in and went cold turkey. Somethings that helped me were:

* Gum
* I quit before I went to bed, so when i woke up the next day I had 12hrs under my belt already.
* Smoking doesnt relax you. Its actually the deep breathing during smoking that does.
* The half life of nicotine is 8hrs, aka theirs none in your body after 16hrs. All mental after that (fake or not, this helped the first few days)
* Hobbies ( Video games, and MTG for me )
* Avoid drinking for a while

This is the 3rd time for me and the longest time quitting. I cant tell the future, but hopefully im done for life. I have no desire to smoke anymore, and can be around it without wanting one. I work retail, so plenty of stress, and I over came it. Just dont beat yourself up when you fail. 

I believe you or anyone can quit, it just wasn't this time. Just give it hell next time."The only thing that made me quit smoking was having a baby. I quit the day I found out I was pregnant and still haven't touched a single cigarette and they are a few months old now. "Bukowski, whiskey, and too many cigarettes. 

I've never sat down and said ""I need to quit."" I have however accidentally quit a few times (the last few months included). I've found it happens most easily when I sit in my garage on a frigid night reading, pouring all the whiskey I can down my throat, and chain smoking like a monster. Makes for a great evening, but if done right a terrible couple of days after. At least with me, even when the hangover wasn't too bad, my chest and body would feel so bad that I had no desire to smoke for a few days. Once those first few days are out of the way, it's much easier to say fuck it and just keep going smoke free. ""I am not a smoker but my dad was. When I was younger I had an obsession, as my mom put it, over my dad's dad who died before I was born. As an inquisitive young child I would always ask questions about him. One day I asked how he died, being around 4 years old my parents decided it would be easier to say he died from smoking (lung cancer caused by smoking), so I turned to my dad and asked if he was going to die too. As soon as that question hit him he stopped for good and hasn't touched a cigarette since. I know this probably doesn't apply to you OP, but it's how my dad quit."Spend that money on other things."I smoked from the age of 13 to the age of 33.
I've tried patches, celery, chewing on straws, gum, and cold turkey.
I wish I could say that my dad's death from cancer, or my grandfatherÛªs battle with emphysema had some influence, but neither did.
Tried the patches in high school and would rip them off at lunch to have a smoke.
""Replacement"" with celery, chewing on straws & gum was a joke.
In my 20's I made a bet with my (then) boyfriend that I could quit...cold turkey. Pride is one hell of a motivator for me, so I quit to prove a point and it lasted just shy of 3 years. 
Once we broke up though, I started smoking again.
The ONLY thing that worked for me is having a strong desire/reason, within me, to quit.
This final time, I had begun to get a little tired of smoking, but didnÛªt really want to quit yet. As lame as it sounds, smoking had become a part of my personality and I wasnÛªt sure if I could ÛÏbe meÛ without cigarettes. 
ThatÛªs when my current boyfriend, a smoker for as long as I was, had a medical scare. (Thankfully all is good though!)
We decided to quit together...cold turkey.
He stopped right away; I decided to finish the 2 packs we had left. 
By setting a limit with the 2 remaining packs, I found that by the time I was halfway through the 2nd pack, I was forcing myself to finish a smoke. 
When the pack was done, I was more than ready to quit. 
I know I have commitment issues with most things, so I told myself that when I was ready, I would allow myself to be a ""social smokerÛ. 
Tricking my brain into thinking that I could have it again if I ""really needed it"" helped soothe the anxiety I felt from the finality of my decision.
I had one almost a year after I quit and realized how gross it tasted. 
It has been over a year since we both quit and neither of us has a desire to smoke cigarettes again.
We just recently started vaping, but we get the stuff without nicotine. I find that helps with all of those anxious, bored moments when I would normally smoke a cigarette.
Not sure if vaping is a good way to quit, as IÛªve heard mixed reviews.
The only thing that seems to work for anyone I know, is a strong desire to stop.
Also, eating large meals and drinking alcohol when you first quit is really hard to do without a smoke, so be mindful and breathe deep.

TL;DR
The only thing that seems to work for anyone I know, is a strong desire to stop.

Good luck!""First time quit because I lived in a place with very high cost of cigarettes. Moved away and started again, then had a bet with a friend: Neither was to smoke, the first one who did had to buy the other whatever drinks he wanted the whole night, wherever he wanted, effectively a $1000 bet. It worked. ""People are strange.  My dad was a smoker for over ten years.  One day he bought a pack of Viceroys, lit the first cig, put it out, crumpled up the pack, and never smoked again.  The idea of becoming used to doing something so disgusting made him sick enough to literally lose the urge.  More and more studies are finding most addictions to be far more psychological, and far less physical, than ever believed."Actually wanting to quit"Finally something that I can talk about....... Un-fumigated for 120 Days after smoking for 10 years.

Quitting and relapsing is a part of the quitting process you only need to stay quit once to quit successfully.åÊ
Some genius said ...quitting is so easy you can quit a hundred times!!!

I did better, I quit a thousand times! The last one before getting married, the last one before buying my car etc etc etc. Actually nothing against last ones but they filled me with sadness once finished and so I'd smoke another. 

I'd buy a pack and stock it with a fellow smoker....and that didn't work neither did patch, gum, lozenges.

Each time, I'd try and then give in to the craving. Actually not the craving itself but the reaction to the craving. Aaah canÛªt handle this anymore Û?Û?Û?.. and then comes the smoke. So whatÛªs your dialogue? Recognize it donÛªt judge it.

Now listen up the craving isn't difficult to deal with. Really isn't. ItÛªs your reaction to the craving that's difficult. Your reaction is the anxiety and discomfort / mental physical to which you react by lighting up. Now this connection has become so practiced that youÛªve stopped seeing the steps. Now when you try to quit you see and feel all the discomfort. 

What youÛªre trying to do is break the pattern. You canÛªt stop the discomfort so observe it without judgement. This takes practice. DonÛªt be angry sad or distressed, just observe. Look at it, see how it feels in your mind.....what connected thoughts does it bring and how does your body react look carefully? If you focus your mind you'll realize the craving is manageable. 

Why focus? Because when you focus, you recognize the reaction to craving for what it is and it gradually evaporates. So focus on the way you feel but donÛªt react. Just focus. This takes practice; maybe you can start while smoking preparing for the time youÛªll quit.  

Watch patiently, patiently through Day 1 focusing on how your mouth feels funny, your heart pounds like a maniac or whatever is happening in your body and the dialogue in your mind. 

Going back to the tantrum analogy you can't stop the tantrum but with patience you can wait the child out. With your focus and lack of judgement you can calm the craving down. Through day 2 to the next couple of days. Now somewhere in there the child screaming for cigarettes has grown more feeble. Ready to raise hell again given a chance but presently feeble. You haven't won yet but you're winning. 

Now how about a little blackmail? LetÛªs buy the one thing you really, really really want with the caveat that youÛªll sell it if you smoke. Its got to be big and something you really, crazily want. I quit because I couldnÛªt bear to sell my new bicycle! 

Will power, youÛªve got a finite amount of it so fight the cigarette craving by giving yourself anything else you crave (that isnÛªt harmful). I ate like a pig!  

Again quitting is so easy you can quit a hundred times but use the relapses to learn about your reaction to craving, donÛªt despair, donÛªt get upset use the relapses to recognize yourself. Because you only need to stay quit once to quit successfully. 

Quitting smoking is only level 1, Level 2 is quitting the craving behavior in other life areas. 

TLDR: Badly written,  You quit by observing yourself
""I am not an ex smoker but my father is. He smoked for over 10 years, from in early 20's to mid to late 30's. He stopped by one day deciding that he did not want to smoke any more he put down the remainder of the pack he had and never picked them up again.""I smoked from the age of 14 until I was 30. When I was around 29 I started looking for a healthy activity to start participating in and mountain biking is what I discovered that appealed to me most. I tried going on some group rides to meet people to ride with and I just couldn't hang due to a lack of cardiovascular endurance. I stopped smoking in November 2011 after purchasing a new and very pricey mountain bike. I figured I had no choice but to quit if I wanted to get the most out of my new ride. The hardest part was when I was hanging with old friends that smoke and definitely when drinking. You just gotta power through that shit and eventually the urges will go away for the most part. Sometimes I still get the urge when I'm shit faced drunk, but then I just remind myself how terrible I'll feel the next day.""Pneumonia that knocked me on my ass for three weeks. It felt like an elephant stepped on my chest. Every breath was difficult. And then being told by the doctor that I could look forward to that every year for the rest of my life. As soon as he said that I quit.  
"I tried Jesus. He helped me quit."I coughed up blood into my kitchen sink back in August 2011.  I quit cold turkey after that.  I went to the doctor and he said that I was still fine--no cancer or anything.  He said he was glad that I had decided to quit.  I've been smoke-free since.  I'm fit as well, too.  Lost 15 kg.""I smoke and have attempted to quit in different ways, patches made my craving even stronger, cold turkey lasted a week and I just really wanted one after a very stressful day at work (work in customer service and you will know what I mean by one of those days) and have not been able to go more than half a day since, I have an electronic cig which I use while driving to avoid the mess,  and potential littering fines as my car doesn't have an ashtray. 
I have no will power to stop and don't know what to do. ""Nothing worked yet for me yet, but gonna give the patch a serious try next month. Both my parents quit cold turkey (my mom quit because she got pregnant), the rest of the ex smokers in my family all quit cold turkey. I have friends who have succeed using Champix and e-cigarettes. 
""When I first started dating my girlfriend I knew that her grandmother died of lung cancer due to being a heavy chain smoker. Her grandmother was her best friend and things between us were getting very serious. I would have dreams of our future and of me causing her great pain because I was dying of lung cancer in these dreams. I would wake up sweaty and nervous, and of course this made me want to have a smoke. Over time I began only smoking when she wasn't around, as we fell deeper in love (cheesy) she was around way more often and I would smoke less and less. Eventually we moved in together and at the point I was only down to two or three smokes a day (I noticed a lot more cash in my pocket as well). I figured if I was barely smoking at all, why not just give it up altogether and now I haven't had a cigarette in a little over a year now.""The gym, jogging/running, and loads of gum.  I went complete cold turkey and those were the only things I changed."I read the book quit smoking the easy way by allen Carr. Was able to quit after I finished the book haven't smoked in 4 years. Worked for a co worker as well. "Man I have tried several times to stop smoking.  I still smoke the occasional  analog,  but I haven't bought a pack in 7 months.  
     At first I tried to roll cigs.  I thought,  ""They will taste worse, and be tedious and annoying,  so it will make me stop"". I didn't help one bit so I knew I had to find a different method. 
     I then found my way into ecigs. I loved my eGo electronic cigarette, I can honestly say it made me stop smoking entirely.  And it only took about 3 months of smoking one until I just got bored with it.  I actually just sold it to a friend to help him stop.  I highly  recommend them to anyone who is trying to stop.
    Also I happen to smoke marijuana,  and that contributed to me quitting cigarettes too.  Every time I get an urge to smoke,  just pack up half a bowl(or what need you)  and catch a buzz.  Instantly takes my cravings away. 
    I'm 23 now so I'm glad I stopped early. I love the smells,  getting the smells back is fucking awesome. Quitting cigarettes is one of the best things I could have done to improve myself. 



TL;DR Ecigs,  weed,  and my nose loves me now""I went to Denver and smoked a bunch of tobacco and weed. Im serious. At the Denver Airport, I just looked at my pack and decided I was done with smoking. I haven't bought a pack since. maybe three cigarettes total since that happened.""I can recommend electronic cigarettes, patches, not a fan of the gum. Certain MAOI PRESCRIPTION drugs caused me cigarette smoke discomfort/nausea."I smoked for 8 years and was up to a pack of cigarettes a day + half a can of dip or so. I quit cold turkey and ate a handful of shelled sunflower seeds if I got a craving. Then I quit the sunflower seeds cold turkey once nicotine wasn't a problem anymore."The idea of becoming a ""non-smoker,"" as opposed to an ""ex-smoker,"" opened up mind-doors for me.  Non-smokers haven't sacrificed anything, *they don't smoke*, whereas ex-smokers have, and living with that illusory sacrifice makes it terribly hard.  It might seem like semantics, but it's just true.

Also, admitting to oneself that it's an addiction, and treating it as such. You have to remove the illusion of enjoyment. You don't enjoy it; you're just getting your fix.  You've been programmed to *believe* you enjoy it by the addiction.  Seems like simple stuff but it really blew my mind."This thread makes me want a cigarette. I quit as a New Year's resolution and whenever I have a drop of alcohol I get instant strong cravings. "The best advice is ""don't smoke"". It takes more effort to smoke than it does to not smoke. Be lazy. You need to want it. Call yourself out and get angry. ""Fuck you, me! I don't NEED it! I can beat it!"" And stop making anger/frustration your excuse.  You don't NEED to smoke. You need to stop being a whiny bitch. 10 years smoking. Cold turkey quit and I'm on day 250. I've also refrained from smoking on multiple excessively drunk nights
""believe it or not - new year's resolution. I just quit after 9 years of smoking. It was two years ago. No patches, no pills, no e-cigarettes, nothing. I smoked the last one on 31st Dec 2011 and this was it. My girlfriend did the same, we both don't smoke since.""Had a heart attack at age 42, doctor comes in room tells me I need to quit smoking and lose 50lbs or I will never see my 7 year old son graduate High School. Happy to report I never had another cigarette and my son is currently getting his PHD in chemistry.""Vaping ecigs... Although I am totally addicted to that now.  However, given an addiction to one or the other I'd choose ecigs all day, every day. They are cheaper, taste better, don't smell like ass, and supposedly healthier.

5 years going strong provided I dont get shit faced at the pub :)""Realizing I was getting nothing out of it. I had my first cigarette my freshman year of college. I only smoked when I was drinking for the next 2-3 years (but I was in college so I was drinking a lot) and for 2-3 years after that I would smoke regularly. After college, I moved back home which helped me cut back to the occasional cig cuz my parents are super against any smoking. I'd have one or two a week and occasionally binge when drinking. This past November, I smoked a whole pack in a weekend when I was out of town for the weekend. I was standing outside smoking the last cig in the pack and just thought to myself, what did I get out of smoking these 20 squares? My breath/clothes/hands smell like shit and it sticks even more when its cold out. I was outside freezing just to smoke when really I wasn't even enjoying it. Decided I never wanted to smoke another cigarette again and haven't had one in two months. "Please try vaping. It is an excellent middle step. Start with r/electronic_cigarette"I was really determined to quit but couldn't get thru the first day or two cravings without  the patch. With it I quit, for 4-5 years. 

Foolishly I started again. After a couple years I was able to quit again with the patch.

I did the gradual thing - 1 every two hours for two days, one every three for three, one every 4 for 4, slapped on the patch and stopped. Was not easy - especially for the first couple of weeks. Even the gradual slow down was killer hard. But it worked in the end for me."Dip"Hmmm, I smoked from about 15 - 22 years old.  It started at about a pack a week and ended up to maybe a pack every 2 or 3 days.  Never a pack a day.  I quit cold turkey for several reasons.  I hated the way it made my skin feel and smell.  Additionally, I wanted to run long distances.  Smoking is truly gross.  Also, smoking is NOT sexy.  When I smoked, I also had impotency issues."Pneumonia."I tried to quit tons of times then I realized yoda was right, ""Do, or do not.

Had an event take place in my life I was in no way prepared to deal with, got way too drunk, made some mistakes, spent 3 days laying in bed suicidal, when I finally snapped out of that I knew it was time to make some changes, gave up all of my vices (for a time) of which smoking was one of them.  Thankfully it's also the one thing I quit that has stuck. "Smoking weed. Making the decision to put every cigarette I smoked out on my leg.  Six cigarettes later and I find them utterly disgusting now."Willpower. 
Alternative: get hooked on something else. ""Quitting smoking takes practice. 

Many people will tell you how one day that just had enough, said Fuck it and quit right there, never smoking again.

What they're not saying is that they tried to quit cold turkey many, many times and they had as much conviction the previous time. Then after a few days the cravings won and they caved in, feeling like a failure and kicking themselves.

But next time they quit, they knew better than hanging out with their smoking buddies or whatever the trigger was. So they lasted a bit longer. Don't get me wrong, it's not like each time you quit you hold out longer. It is very random each time, but the trend goes in the right direction.

Eventually after quitting more times than you can remember, you hit a smooth ride. You fight the cravings and temptation and after an agonizing month, you're still free. If you get here, it should be easy, right? WRONG!

So you take a drag and next thing you know you're doing a pack a day again. But you quit again, and again, and again.

Eventually you are really free, it's been four years since I smoked my last ciggy. I quit many times using every tool out there (Alan Carr really does work). Once I quit for 9 months, then I had a celebratory cigar with a friend, big mistake. After that I quit many times not lasting more than a few days. Then I quit again for 6 months, but my wife who quit with me and started smoking again. 

Then one day, I said fuck it, I'm done. I haven't picked up a cigarette since.""Cold Turkey and didn't drink for 2 years.  I know if I drank, I would smoke.""Champix combined with making my mind up that is was time. Seriously Champix though, I don't miss smoking in the slightest even at all!""Willpower. Thought about my health, said 'fuck this I'm never touching another cigarette' and quit. Went from 20-40 a day to zero and never looked back.""Well the e cig was a joke for me. But it made me realize it was a physical addiction not a chemical. Once I had that figured out, I just threw it away. Haven't gone back since.

1 year.""I decided to quit, I wasn't enjoying chain smoking anymore and knew that for me the trick is to not have the first cig then I won't start the cycle of smoking from waking to sleeping. Any obsessions of smoking will pass and can be over come as long as I don't act on them.

The really shitty thing is I have Ulcerative Colitis and have been mainly in remission for 6 years. When I quit smoking I got hit with a flare up which has taken me out of life for the last 3 months. I have been bed ridden, in extreme agony, loosing a lot of blood.. the pain caused by ulcerative colitis is of another beast. Think shards of glass passing through your bowls as they are being twisted, pulled and ripped.

I've now been in hospital for a week, requiring IV Corticosteroid, rectal Corticosteroid, blood transfusions, potassium drip. And immunosuppressants then surgery are next options. But it has come down to that I don't want to smoke anymore, I can't even justify having a cig even though this most recent UC flare up was most likely caused by quitting smoking."Making myself feel insanely guilty every time I caved. Eventually it wasn't even satisfying because the self-loathing was overwhelming. "Cold turkey. You need to understand that quitting smoking isn't about will power, it's about obedience. make a decision and STICK TO IT. Good luck.""I chewed that stupid gum for three years.  Realize there are two pieces.  The physicality of touching a cig, the smoke, the heat.  And, the actual drug addiction.

Use the gum to curb the drug addiction as you work through replacing the physicality of it all.  Try carrot sticks, candy, whatever works.

Then, one day, three years later, I got tired of chewing the stupid gum and gave it up.  Sometimes I chew sugarless gum when I need a ""taste"" in my mouth.

Bottom line, though, you really have to want to do it.""Avoiding anything I associated with smoking. Places I smoked, like smoke break rooms, being around people who are smoking, and not drinking at all for the first 3 months. Having a good strong reason to quit also help.""Electronic Cigarettes.

If you're going back to the real thing then I suspect you have one of those crappy cig-a-likes from your local convenience store. 

Go grab a Joye Ego C Twist, a Kanger Pro Tank, and some 24mg Nic juice.""This will probably get buried but...

I attribute quitting smoking cigarettes to ""magic"" mushrooms. While tripping on some very strong ones, I left my roommate's room to go smoke in the kitchen. Halfway through smoking it, I stared at it for awhile, then asked myself ""why am I smoking?""

The next day, cigarettes just didn't taste the same. Over the period of two months cigarettes just lost their appeal.""Former 1/2 pack a day smoker here. First you need a solid REASON to quit. Risks of cancer/emphysema etc are too far off to hit home. Coughing and wheezing during sex once was my final straw.

I tried patches, gum, slowly weening off them, e-cigs w/ nicotine you name it. It all failed miserably. Why? Cuz I was still puttin that nicotine in my body.

After 6+ attempts I said fuck it and tried cold turkey. It sucked, and I hated everything and everyone for about a month straight, but I haven't had a smoke in over 2 years. 

I STILL get cravings sometimes. Toothpicks and non nicotine gum are my best friends when it comes to curbing that need for one more drag.""Had a child, once the decision affects more than yourself, its a little easier to give up
"It helps when you have someone else doing it with you. My sister and I have been clean for 6 years."It's easy, do not, I MEAN DO NOT buy another pack of smokes. Done. 
(This also helps if your not around others who smoke, because of course you will just bum them)""cold turkey and not wanting to go through quitting a second time.

remember: you dealt with stress before smokes, you can deal with stress without them again.""I put myself in a situation where I didn't even have an option to for about 3 months, and I know that can be quite a difficult thing to do. I was participating in an outdoors program, and tobacco wasn't permitted in the course. it worked great for me i wasn't even thinking about it because i was busy doing other shit. "A lot of gum (not cum) "I am 43.  I was 35 when I stopped.  I had been smoking Marlboro Reds from the time I was 13. Varying levels of ""pack per day"".

Even when I was in the US Army, running marathons and in the best shape of my life -- I was close to 2 packs a day.

I would quite for a while and always find some bullshit reason to allow myself to start (or keep) smoking and.  ""I'm going on vacation - I know I'm gonna be partying"" etc.

Always went back.

Finally I ""used"" my wife and kids""  I figured I may just be able to get some extra time out of my life to spend with them (1 day or days years - - doesn't matter). I decided ""Yep - I want whatever time with them I can get.""

This was on my drive to work. I had about 3/4 of a pack. I rolled down the window, chucked them out (sorry about that) and haven't had a single drag since.  December 8 will be 9 years.


You can do this.......just don't try to bullshit yourself""Smoking less and less until eventually the cravings go away. I set goals for myself, smoke <4 cigs per day this week, <3 the next, <2 the next, <1 the next, freedom. I was not a heavy smoker to start with, so that helped. The most important thing is patience, and allowing yourself to have cheat days if you really need it, but not letting those cheat days set you back by weeks of effort."Money. I moved from AZ to NY and refused to pay more than $5 for a pack. I bought one box of nicotine patches and was done in 2 weeks. (I was a half pack per day smoker.) "Regular hot yoga. Tough first few days, but soon after my lungs cleared up and I developed a strong urge not to fuck them up further. It is a tough remedy though. "I quit cause its a choice. Choose to be weak  or choose to be strong. Find any reason which there are many to quit and hold yourself accountable. I smoked for 15 years and just stopped. There are better things than wasting your money and getting sick. Choose to be reasonable and to do the right thing for yourself. Nicorette Gum"I quit when I realized that my habit wasn't really about smoking. 

Smoking did some things for me. If I had to make a big decision to make, smoking gave me time to reflect or deflect. If I had just made a big decision, smoking have me time to recompose myself. If I was bored of the conversation, I could always step out for a cigarette and hope that the conversation would be better in 5 minutes. Smoking occupied my time but it was really just a placeholder.

I quit three years ago when I decided that I wanted that time back."What people say is not really a good way of testing this "A heart attack at the ripe age of 23. I was a pack and a half a day smoker and quit cold turkey because I was in the hospital for over a week without cigs, so I said why not just keep going. 2 years later and I'm pretty healthy but still have to get checked every year for my heart.""Honestly after 8 years of 30 cigs a day and many many failed attempts all it took was a bet with a co-worker, no was was I going to get beaten by that smug fucker Hehe

5 years going strong provided I dont get shit faced at the pub :)""A quit drug called champix. I quit for 3 years on champix and then started up again. I went to the doc the other day to get a new prescription and start all over again. However you do it, you have to want to.""Lots of comments, but you asked so I'll tell you what worked for me:

I had to really want it. Not think I should quit. Not have others want me to quit. I got sick of the damn things controlling my life and wanted to quit.

The second key was I didn't tell anyone. I just quit. Friends would say let's have a smoke. I'd answer go ahead I don't feel like one right now. I didn't tell anyone for about two weeks because if your friends smoke they won't really want you to quit. Need to bum a smoke of someone? Tell them you quit and they will shower you with them.

Then came the hard part. The first two weeks. I read somewhere it takes about two weeks for nicotine to leave your body completely so up until then I had cravings like crazy. They only last a few minutes. Never ever smoke when you're having a craving. Make that promise to yourself. When they come, just sit down and say it will go away because it is true. Then after two weeks, when you want one (and you will) remember how intense those fucking cravings are. Remember that even if you have that one cigarette you're putting nicotine back into your body and will have to relive that first two weeks all over again. You'll go through it all over again for two minutes. I found that is why quitting was so hard I wouldn't smoke for a few days and then have one. Maybe I would go for a week than have one. I made an unbearable situation endless because the drug never got out of my system.

Finally, once you make it through the woods don't ever have another cigarette. It won't taste good, but you'll smoke it. It will feel good. And everybody always starts smoking again because of that one cigarette. You'll be vulnerable while drinking. You'll be vulnerable at those times you usually smoked ... after meals, with that first cup of coffee in morning, long drives ... so be extra vigilant.

You can do it. Cigarettes are shitty for you and your body will respond to their absence in a positive way. Consider making other changes if you can like working out. If you do that, focus on the cardio stuff that gets you breathing because it will make you appreciate the lack of smoke in your life. 

If you're a pot smoker too, realize that will make giving up cigarettes even more difficult.""When I was a smoker, I was into Drum Halfzware Shag. It was like $8.05 for a whole can of the stuff and had a very pleasurable rich flavor that I very much enjoyed. Well then Obama decided to tax rolling tobacco the same as regular cigarettes. The price went up to almost $30 for the same sized can overnight. Due to the price increase, every store around me stopped carrying it, so I started ordering it off the internet. Well then Obama made it so you can't buy cigarette tobacco from the internet anymore.  After about a month of smoking cigarettes I didn't even like, I bought an electronic cigarette and stopped smoking cigarettes altogether.

Thanks Obama!

I've been smoke free since 2010 though I still use my electronic cigarette. I have been slowly tapering the nicotine levels in the e-liquid that I use and hope to one day not use nicotine anymore.

I could be making an assumption here, but my tip for quitting with e-cigs is to get a really good one. The first one I had was the crappy convenience store kind that looks like a cigarette and glows on the end... those things are terrible. Do a little research and find a nice one. Also try to find a flavor you like. It took me a while to figure out, but the tobacco flavors are pretty nasty IMO. I've been using cinnamon lately and really like it! Finally make sure you carry an extra battery, juice, and atomizer in case you need to top off, replace, or recharge.

Also, stop buying cigarettes... then you'll end up being a bum... and nobody likes a bum.

Best of luck!

I had nicotine gum for plane rides (I travel a lot for work and have a stressful job) so I know the alternatives weren't great. Nicotine replacement only prolongs the effects of your physical withdrawal, eventually you're still going to feel super awful.

I finally decided I'd give it a shot. First I quit smoking for about six hours just to get a taste of it, finished the rest of my pack and the next day it was quitsies. I prepared the wife and told my friends and manager at work that I was quitting (so they would avoid coming into the office), then I just quit.

Six months now without any nicotine. Can't say I don't get my hourly cravings or the cravings after a big meal, it hasn't really gotten that much better to be honest. It will take a long time. But hey, I used all that money I saved on cigarettes to buy bigger clothes!

I didn't even agree with everything he said, and sometimes he stretched his analogies too far, but in the end the vast majority of what he said was true and it made me realize some fundamental pieces of bullshit that we get told by society and smokers around us.

One of the biggest of those is that I am ""Giving something up"" by stopping smoking, hence why he calls it stopping and not ""quitting"".  To quit somewhat implies you are giving up something that is good, and if you read through either of those books you will hardly look at smoking as good anymore.

I'm a little sad the highest upvote is the most useless piece of information to help you on this topic, but I pray this comment finds you and gives you the drive to at least read one of the books I mentioned.  I promise you it won't be a waste of time and will definitely help you along your way.

I am not the kind of person who likes self-help books--I despise them, actually--and Carr's book is unfairly bundled together with those books. It shouldn't be. He writes very plainly and practically about the psychology of smoking and he made me realize very quickly why I was smoking, which made it really easy to stop.""I only smoked for a couple years and I don't know if I was ever fully addicted.  I did smoke daily though.   Basically I got too drunk/sick one too many times,  where cigarette smell just made me extra nauseous. So it just kinda turned me off from cigarettes over all. I think they're gross now. "Vaping and college. Cant smoke on campus without a fine. So vaping does the trick for me. Relapsed a few times but been good since the start of January. 1 Month going strong!Cold turkey. The way I thought about it was that withdrawals are like a passing sickness such as the flu that you just have to harden the fuck up and deal with until they pass."I hate to boast, but for me it came down to sheer willpower. I just knew I wanted to quit, so I did."Actually wanting to quit. All my previous attempts failed until I really WANTED it."Cold Turkey.  If the OP has failed five times then they need to keep trying.  I tried every method under the sun - gum, patches, medication, etc.  Cold Turkey is the only thing that stuck, and that was after 50+ attempts.  I finally got tired of quitting and was able to get over the hump.  Ditch that electronic cigarette immediately.  "Find a girl that you really care about that hates smoking. Cold turkey seems easy after that."Electronic cigarette. 

Vapin it right now.

I mean, you gotta get a quality set up to quit, otherwise you'll fuck yourself into smoking again.""Switch to a decent e cig that works well and stays charged for several days and throw out all your real cigs. 

Get an e cig juice that has a nice flavor and start with 6mg of nicotine. If that's not enough go to 12mg. You won't stay off cigs if you use the juice with no nicotine. The carcinogens and burning plant matter from real cigs is what hurts your body mostly. Nicotine without those other negative factors isn't that bad for u in small doses. 

Would u rather be addicted to smoking a clean vapor or burning some shitty dried up leaves with a bunch if chemicals in them? Exactly. 

Also download a cig quitting app so you can watch your progress each day just by checking your phone. This is good motivation. 

Try and remember how fucking gross smoking is. Try And remember how nice it is to be healthy and not on the brink if sickness all the time. 

You can do it, I promise you don't have to smoke for the rest of your life to be happy. 



""My father smoked for a couple years in college. A year and a half ago he had surgery for a problem that ended up being far worse than anticipated and we almost lost him. Really it's a miracle that he lived. Had he continued smoking there is no chance he would have made it through the surgery. Seeing him lying unconscious in the ICU day after day and realizing how angry and hurt I would have been had he not lived, just because of something as stupid as smoking, really struck a cord. There's no way I want to make my family feel like that. After nearly a decade of being a smoker, I quit cold turkey and haven't looked back."I quit when I saw my Nan die from cancer. Definitely not how I want to go out.  "I haven't smoked in over four months.  I'm still struggling with it, but the only way I was able to give it up for good was to go cold turkey.  I had been smoking for well over ten years and I've tried everything I could to quit including patches, gum, chantix, e cigs...you name it I tried it.

This is actually the longest I've ever gone without a cigarette.  I think it has something to do with not wanting to relive the withdrawal process again.  I didn't do anything drastic to change my life, it was all mental mind fuck.  I really had to think about what and who I needed to quit for.  I wanted to quit for me, but not the me I know of right now.  The me right now is healthy no problems at all really, but my future self...I had to decide that my future self deserved to be healthy.

Another thing that motivated me was my mom.  She's been smoking for as long as I can remember.  It breaks my heart.  She's got COPD on top of her asthma and everything.  She's not even 50 and I worry about losing her every day.  Anyway, a little over a year ago she wound up in the hospital because she couldn't breathe.  Honestly she couldn't even gasp for air.  After that she switched to electronic cigarettes.  And believe it or not that is a huge step for her.  

Anyway,  I think about how I wish my mom had a better quality of life.  I wish she could be healthy and have a pair of brand new lungs.  And I think about how 22 years ago she was my age thinking ""Man, I need to stop smoking"" and never having the nerve to do it.    ""Will power. Cigarettes just started making me feel like shit after each one so I decided I had enough. You won't be able to quit until you truly want to.
""I tried so many times.  My birthday, the beginning of the month, the end of the month, a new year.  My monkey as was too lazy to read Allan cares book.  One day I ran out of smokes and decided not to buy another pack.  I also remember somebody on reddit posted a YouTube video of the affects of smoking 100 cigarettes and how that shit stays in your lungs. I used lozenges for two weeks and it was brutal. That was six months ago. Now the smell of smokes makes me want to puke. But I still get urges every so often. Smoking is like a gang. Get out before it kills you. ""My girlfriend so far up my ass about having to quit.... That I just didn't want to deal with it anymore. 

Edit: Spelling on mobile ""Chantix. I had a best case result. A week after i had quit i felt like i had never smoked in my life. Haven't had a puff in six years. This is after many failed attempts, patch, gum etc and 15 yrs of smoking. ""I had bronchitis twice in a year. I was coughing until I threw up, regularly for a combined total of 7 months. I looked up chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and COPD. Did a ton of research about it on the internet. Scared myself straight. I quit cold turkey mid pack on St. Patty's 2012. I looked at my friends and told them. This is my last cigarette.

After quitting cold turkey, the scare of COPD kept me off of them. Also, one of the biggest things, I put updates and status' on facebook often. I talked to everyone about it. I kept it as a topic for a long time. Everyone was so proud of me and my friends really made me feel great. I don't like to admit I can't do something, and I don't like to fail in any public setting, even facebook. So I never hit another cigarette. It's been 2 years (almost). I still want to smoke almost every day. But I just remember why I quit and don't want to throw away the past 2 years. Also, I FEEL AMAZING! I can breathe; I can run!

You can do anything you put your mind to. Just control yourself.""General Snus was a great way for me to go. Although it still is a tobacco habit, it is great to not be smoking for the last several years."Marijuana."Chantix and 100 dollar smoking surcharges off each pay check for insurance.

In seriousness, it was my own will power so that I'll be around for my unborn kid(s) someday.""Cold turkey...Strong will and commitment. Or when you get congested chest, bronchitis or a spre throat, remind yourself how bad it could get down the road.""In my mid-40s.  Every time I got a cold it was cough, bronchitis then occasionally pneumonia.  One time it even progressed to pleurisy.  But every time it was bronchitis that required steroids and antibiotics.  After going through this hell more times than I care to count, I vowed to stop.  I got an e-cig and gradually lowered the nicotine content.  Now it's been a year tobacco free.  I had to actually want to stop.  Deep deep down in my heart, I never wanted to before.  I'd made it as long as 8 months but always took it back up.  In other words, I got sick and tired of being sick and actually wanted to quit!""Dipping worked for me.  At first I did both for awhile, then I stopped smoking entirely and just dipped.  Eventually it got to the point where I didnt want it anymore.  Six months later, I smoked a cigarette, threw up almost immediately after, and was like yea I think im done.  When people smoke around me now I actually feel ill.""Don't give up.  A failed attempt isn't a wasted attempt.  When I quit (very long time ago) I asked my doctor what the best way to quit and he told me that nicotine only says in your system for 3 days and after that it's all mental.  So I figured I could tough it out for a few days and be on easy street.  Boy was I wrong.  Metal addition is tough and I failed a lot but with each time I progressively moved away from the habit.  Try to go as long as you can without one and keep track of how many days it's been. If you screw up try and beat your ""high score"".  Eventually you get to the point where you can go a month or two and that's when it gets a lot easier.  It's tough but worth it.  It's a gross habit and you save a ton of dough by quitting but you know all that shit.  Just keep trying and good luck!  ""I bought a new car and wouldn't let myself smoke inside. That eliminated one of my biggest triggers. Then later that year, I used the step 1 patch for a week successfully, switched to step 2 and it was just like going cold turkey...so I got off the patch and haven't had a smoke since. Going on 11 years. Also, I think I may be one of a very few that managed to quit on their own birthday.""Im not a smoker, but my mom was. she started when she was 12, and she didnt stop until she had a heart attack 4 years ago at age 52. She finally stopped after she almost lost her life....I'll never smoke because of that reason."Chantix worked for me. I gave me some weird dreams for a month. But it worked. I quit and have been not smoking for last 6 years! /r/electronic_cigarette"I wanted to. Really wanted to.

I quit smoking when I met the love of my life."Chantix was a miracle drug for me.   Smoked for 20 years.  Quit over a 3 month period.  That was 8 years ago now.  I still get the occasional urge but I know all it takes is one to be hooked againChantix smoker for 30 years haven't smoked in 3 and will never again"I was on the verge of quitting when I went to buy a pack of Marlboro Reds and the price had increased to $3. That was a line in the sand, but it came at the perfect time.  It was 1999 and I was 22. I had just discovered that it feels good to have personal responsibility and it seemed like a challenge to improve myself, and my life. I felt that by overcoming it I would have more control over myself and more confidence. I was also tired of being sick all the time. When I smoked I would get colds and allergies easily and it took a long time to get over it.  I was extremely addicted. I tried the patches and they were giving me even more nicotine than I was getting by smoking. I recognized that as the trap that it was and used the lowest dose patch they make and cut it in half, for about two weeks. I never smoked another cigarette. I still wanted one a year later. I wanted one quite a bit less three years later but I could have easily started back up but I didn't, because I would be disappointed in myself.  It was my love of myself that pushed me away from them.  Somewhere between 3 and 5 years I could honestly say I had no desire whatsoever to smoke a cigarette. 15 years later and I still have not smoked one. Maybey once or twice a year I'll have a cigar but I don't inhale and my mouth tastes like ass for three days. I hate the smell of cigarettes now, they smell like poison and irritate my lungs. ""wellbutrin...it's a miracle drug!!

buy it online from an Indian pharmacy "I didn't buy or bum cigarettes.  No matter how bad a craving got I just reminded myself I wasn't buying them anymore.  Hard to smoke what you don't have right?I quit  a little over 2 years ago after my 3 yr old daughter told me that when she gets as big as me she wanted to smoke too.  I think within the next week I went and bought some nicotine patches and haven't smoked since. I still get urges every now and then but I can definitely ignore them."I held on to my last pack for a few months, occasionally tucking a cigarette behind my ear, so I could always delay the gratification of what was essentially a second away. I would push back a few minutes at a time, then eventually get distracted and forget for longer periods of time. 

I would also surround myself with smokers, and practice not doing it. It sounds lame, but in the end, you have to demonstrate the willpower. Don't worry about past failed attempts, and just focus on your future, and occupy your mind with non-smoking thoughts.


I'm over a year without smoking, but I still get the ""one can't hurt"" logic kicking in, but it's just a matter of my knowing I no longer want to wake up with a throat rasp that keeps me away.

Also, I smoke a ton of weed. ""MEDITATION.

Seriously.""I quit at the same time as a Tajikistani immigrant I knew. He put it in real simple terms, ""All it takes is will power. Just stop. The problem with many Americans is they have no will power."" It really is that simple, just stop.

1.5+ smoke-free years later, 'MURICA!""I used cinnamon tic tacs. Every time I wanted a smoke, I would pop a bunch of tic tacs. I went through a ton of those fuckers, but in the end, it worked. I will be 8 years smoke free on Monday."I am using the 21mg. Nicotine patch.. Works pretty good. For some people its a little to strong but I think the slight buzz helps me a lot.. "Read Allan Carr's book ""The Easy Way To Stop Smoking"" Worked for me. I smoked 1.5 packs a day for 40 years. Read this book, learned the truth about smoking and nicotine addiction (the only real reason we smoke in the first place) The truth put me in the right mind set to quit with ease this time. It felt like I turned off a switch. I was just done, I am a non-smoker. 14 months and not looking back. Tried and failed 100's of times, this time was easy. No patches, no gum, no pretend cigarettes. It was well worth the $9.00 I spent. Saved over $4000.00 so far. "A great way to stop is by going on Reddit today and finding this topic. Just reading all of these stories and experiences is inspiring. "I smoked for 13 years. Starting with regular cigarettes, then non-filter cigarettes and at the end tobacco and rolling paper [it was getting a quite expensive vice].
I stopped in a single day. What was different with my other couple of tries done previously was the single fact that I really wanted to this time.
Although I admit, Canadian winter and the thought to go out to smoke helped :)

Another thing I found out during my smoking years was *Fisherms's Friend*. After having one of them, the desire to smoke disappeared due to the strong taste [the liquorice perhaps?] of the candy.

Even if I haven't smoked in the past 4 years, I still regularly eat them...you give a vice for another I guess :)"Flooding worked for me and the wife. Smoked about 30 cigarettes at a rave and felt like walking death the next day. Double pneumonia."It's gonna be buried, but my husband quit because of me. I didn't badger him, but he used the patches, he wanted to be smoke free by our wedding day. Ever since then, he is. I loved him before, I still love him now, but as a person having a super sensitive sense of smell (not allergies, but I can smell what someone is eating from two rooms down with the door closed, or smell when someone is sick), he smells so MANLY, like man, and sweat and HIM, it's just such a turn on not to smell ashes anymore. :)""Getting pregnant. The day I had my first positive test, I had one last cigarette, then gave the rest of the pack to a guy smoking outside Albertson's on the way to work. 

It's been almost a year, haven't smoked since, and I have a three month old. Totally worth it.

(Although when I walk by someone who is smoking, I tend to inhale deep. I miss the smell.)""I smoked weed and cigs for about 10 years. Quit cold turkey on the cigs and used the extra money to buy more herb! Though this isn't completely giving up smoking, giving up tobacco has helped my general health greatly!""I smoked for a couple years in my teens, but try as I might, I could not become addicted. Still, I have converted several friends over to  e-cigarettes. Many of the people that I converted said they hated e-cigarettes, but the key is to get the ones with the giant tanks and the huge batteries. The first time I tried one, I took a large hit, thinking that it would be more gentle than smoke. However, I was surprised that the hit made me choke and gave the throat feeling of a cigarette. It's not a perfect solution, because of the blood vessel constricting properties of nicotine. Another drawback is a large initial cost of about $150 for a good unit, plus there is the issue of education. Most smokers I know are too lazy to learn how to properly use the device and adjust the wicks and such, but the ones that have made the investment have completely stopped the use of conventional cigarettes. I have read several articles that most smokers are more addicted to the ritual than the nicotine. These devices provide both aspects, are cheaper in the long run, and you can use them practically anywhere. Quitting smoking is certainly better, but I feel strongly that these devices can save lives. Good luck!""I got cancer, and that stopped me from smoking. Wasn't even lung cancer, but fuck that, your lungs are very sensitive and vulnerable to a great deal of things, no need to endanger them any more than you must. I do still consume Cannabis regularly through a vaporizer and even that is dangerous to do. But I find Cannabis far more useful than tobacco, and vaporizing a decent medium. "I'm late to the party but - I took up running. Better de-stresser than a cigarette. Best way to lose an addiction is replace it with a better one."I was well over 100lbs overweight (somewhere around 120-140, stopped counting when I tipped 320 on the scale) and made massive life changes 3 years ago. Quitting smoking was a minor part of that, and at the time, was simple to do compared to losing the weight.

Both stuck. I've not gained any of the weight back, and I think have had maybe 9 cigarettes in the 3 year span.""I ended up having a pulmonary embolism from a blood clot. That kind of pain was incredible, and waking up from from the delaudid to a congealed pool of blood during recovery wasn't exactly reassuring.  My brother died from the same thing, and I ended up picking up smoking again around the time he died. The irony is not lost upon me.The way it was presented to me was that I could smoke and continue to get blood clots and possibly become brain dead, or quit. Knowing how it feels to lose a loved one made me end up quitting. That and the constant pain and severely restricted lung capacity.""I used Nicorette losenges -- the chalky ones that might remind you of Tums.  Popped one every few hours, and over time, found myself using fewer (this is the intended result) and tapering to where finally I decided I was done using them. 

I got a 12 week supply through my health insurance, but only ended up using them for 5-6 weeks.  

That was almost 2 years ago, still smoke free. Good luck!""Just before I quit I had reduced my smoking to mainly only when I was drinking. However, I could smoke a pack a night. I tried the nicotine gum and that worked for me as I could use it while drinking. 

The secret of staying off the fags is getting into exercise. You need your lungs at their best and the feeling after working out is far better than cigarettes and you just feel better all round. Knowing that smoking fucks all that up worked for me. "Here we go again"I cannot give personal experience, but my dad was a smoker. He never smoked in the house and agreed with my mom that if they were to have kids, he would stop smoking. One specific day, he simply threw away his last pack of cigarettes and never touched them again. He struggled to keep away, but he stopped cold turkey and fought never to go back.

A year later, to the day, I was born.""I started smoking brands o normally never would - Virginia slims, lucky strike, the pouches you roll yourself, little cigars, etc.  I smoked less and less, and then I was smoking stale assed cigs.  Eventually, taste aversion kicked in and I didnt want it anymore.""Oddly enough, a commercial featuring Lance Armstrong sleeping.  I still don't quite get it.""I coughed up little bits of lung. I took up an ecig fir a couple months then got rid if it. The most powerful tool is your will. You will want to smoke, but resisting the urge. I smoked for about 10 years. Nothing can make you smoke but yourself. Jedi mind trick them smokes outta your head! ""Conditioned myself to hate smoking, I drank unsweetened grapefruit juice every time I had a craving, and after every meal. It's awful stuff. Members of the church I go too also helped me and were the ones who have me this idea."Allen Carr's East Way to Quit Smoking"Honestly, I was able to give up smoking cigarettes by smoking weed. Probably not the best resolution but I've been off of cigarettes for about a year now.

"I had my wisdom teeth taken out and was so afraid of getting dry sockets that I got on the patch. It worked so well for me. The biggest thing though was after about a week of not smoking I just kept telling myself that if I had a cigarette then all the shit I went though to quit and all the withdrawals would be for nothing. So I kept at it and now I'm over two years smoke free. Good luck! "For me it was accepting the fact that my life would suck more after I quit. I made sure to not rush to replace the habit with a healthy one. I wanted to really feel and accept the new reality of not having 25 little buddies to comfort me all day...I considered it a challenge. Be aware that you're going to feel the urge to smoke, REALLY feel it..and then feel it pass by. Take up a healthy habit when and if you feel like it. You can do it if you like a good challenge. Considering you failed 5 times than I really doubt you'll be able to...actually I bet $100 that you can't quit for a year..starting this Feb 1st..wimp

COLD TURKEY... don't be a pussy."I got cancer. Quit immediately. 7.5 years and still going strong!"Not my story, but my dads. I made a deal with my dad that if i could go a month without candy, he could go the rest of his life without smoking. I did this when I was a 12 year old that lived a mile away from a sweet shop.""My girlfriend and I went cold turkey. It wasnt easy, but we kept each other motivated to quit. For me personally, I got tired of not being able to breathe after doing just menial tasks.""Just stop. Cold Turkey. You don't need anything to help you. That is all in your mind. Sounds hard when you feel like you are really addicted, but just stop. You are not a fucking wimp, don't let that shit control your life. You a man/woman right? Well fucking act like it and put those Cigs in their place.""Pack a day for about 5 years, two packs a day for 5 years or so after..

The specific brand and type I smoked was often stale at a few of the local shops (not the most popular I guess). I went to one place, they were out, went to another and they had some crazy prices about $1/pack more than usual. So it was either pay extra, pay normal for stale smokes, or just say fuck it. So I said fuck it and quit. My girlfriend, living with me, took two days two realize I quit and another day or two to come to terms with holy shit he's serious.

I quickly ordered an e-cig but after a few days of playing with that I just gave up. I bummed a smoke every few days from someone, then once a week, then once every few weeks, and now I'll smoke one every few months give or take (socially). I considered my quit time ""reset"" every time I broke down until I was to the ""once every few weeks"" stage I think. I also recall a ""friday smoke break"" milestone to where I waited all week for that Friday to have one smoke. Pushed back every craving. That Friday smoke? It wasn't even a tenth as sweet as I thought it would have, and it tasted kind of..gross? Weird.. :)

My crutch, the real thing that kept me going, initially was lots of reading. I read and read and read some more on quit stories, motivational quotes, and quite a bit of data around the addiction itself. After ~72 hours, the chemical hold is gone and it's all habit from there. So getting to 72 hours, zero e-cig or anything, was rough..I decided to give up all other vices as well including soda and all sorts of things. Drastic change for me. Walking every afternoon turned into running every morning. I got into the best shape of my life (which isn't saying much). Eventually I retook some of the vices, let go of some of the workout routine, and settled into a decent middle ground of moderation and sanity I think.

I don't think I could have quit without the drastic changes. Between the runner's high, coughing up increasing (and then decreasing) amounts of tar and other nasty shit, and the huge glaring fact that after 72 hours I ALREADY WON. All I had to do was not be stupid and throw it all away. 72 hours, eh, not so much to throw away. When I hit a week the cravings weren't giving way much yet unfortunately (cig every time I got on the tollroad, cig every time I was waiting on that exit ramp going to work, cig walking to the car before lunch..the timed ones were the WORST!!!) but I had a WEEK of smoke free hours at risk..Two weeks, no way I was throwing it away. By a month, it was more an annoyance than a craving and I really felt stupid for making such a big deal out of quitting.

You mention the smoke break being the vice. Take the same breaks but do something else. I did the same thing and changed my vice to going to refill my water bottle, walking the long way across the office building, walking downstairs, walking to my car, anything to get up and move and get rid of that restless feeling. I couldn't sit in my chair and just dwell on that 10:15am daily smoke break I'm missing out on.

Mind over matter; you'll beat it!"Electronic cigarettes got me to stop smoking regular cigs. I still use my e-cig daily but I haven't smoked a cig in a month now. The sudden realization that smoking is an utterly disgusting habit."It's been 12 years since I've had a drag off a cigarette...

I tried quitting cold turkey numerous times and kept failing.  I learned to just keep trying; don't let your past failures depress you and make you feel like you aren't in control.  **Just try again**. 

The more attempts you make at quitting, the more likely you are to be successful at it.

After maybe the 15th time I tried to quit cold turkey, it finally happened.

Good luck my friend.""Cold turkey bro. Cold turkey. 

Only way to go, and the only way to make you feel 100% in control of yourself. Hell, I feel on top of the god damn world after quitting cold turkey. I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT!""I'm in college, and one of my good friends quit right before Finals Week. He thought that if he could go through that hell of a week without a cigarette, he could go the rest of his life without one. He hasn't touched one since.""A combination of WELLBUTRIN (bupropion hydrochloride) and my long time habit of never smoking in my car.  I was in a situation where I had to make three round trips of two hundred miles each, nearly back to back over a three day period.  I had not bought any smokes, and on the last leg, of the last trip, I realized I hadn't smoked in three days, and I could do this.  That was February 2003, and I have not smoked since.  By the way, I smoked for 40 years.""This isn't me but my dad. He was addicted to smoking. He's smoke maybe a pack or 2 a day. It wasn't until he had an x-ray of his lung and saw that there was a black hole and the doctor told him if it grew any bigger, he only had a 30% chance of living. I hope it doesn't need to be taken that far to make people stop smoking. Choose the right choice and use your sheer willpower to stop yourself."I had adderol prescribed and would chain smoke. When I stopped taking adderol I stopped wanting to smoke. Smoked for 11 years"Also, if you're like me, make sure you apologize for how shitty you will be to everyone during the quitting process, because it is hard on your nerves.  Good luck.""The way I done it was counted ho
w many was a regular amount for me in a day, say about 12, after that I rationed out 11 smokes a day until I was used to that. I didn't put a time frame on it. As time went on I kept reducing as a felt comfortable u til I was at 3 a day, then I just went cold turkey and chewed a lot of gum(which helped during the cutting down too!) I have tried to get some friends to try this method but they always prefer cold turkey and always crack after a week or so. Off them 3 years now.""A combination of things. The biggest help was moving to a new city- with a different routine, I just sort of forgot to smoke and gradually lost taste for it.
I still smoke occasionally but nowhere near my former pack-a-day habit.""Here's my story and what worked - please note that this is may not be applicable to everyone. First off, I found I had to be ready to quit. It didn't matter how many times somebody told me I should or how many times it crossed my mind. I had to reach a point where I was sick of it myself. I was sick of going outside constantly, having to take breaks from work or activities with friends. And I was especially tired of not being able to keep up with people physically. I reached a point where unhappiness as a result of smoking outweighed the joy it used to bring me. Many of my friends had quit, so it was also often an isolated activity.

Having said that, here's how it went. I set a date. I made sure I ran out on that day. No temptations left behind. I threw away my lighters and ashtray. During my first week, I did everything I could to distract myself physically and mentally. As soon as I got home from work, I was out walking, running, or biking. I would walk to areas in my neighborhood I'd never been. Go exploring by myself. Cook some complex and fantastic meals. I made bottles of roasted chili oil for friends.

During the first two weeks, and I cannot emphasize this enough, I made sure to do the activities that made me want to smoke previously. The activities that I associated with smoking. I visited the bar every other day just to have a beer. I made full tasty meals. I visited coffee shops. I went to rock shows. Anything I could do to force myself into temptation. I also quit during a super stressful project at work (i.e. no more smoke breaks to relax). I knew that if I could give a big middle finger to smoking in those circumstances, I'd never face that kind of temptation again. It's a method of pure stubbornness.

And it worked. I smoked for 10 years and was able to quit cold turkey that way. The first couple months are hard - no kidding yourself there. I had nightmares for months where I slipped up and smoked. I would wake up with the most horrible feeling of guilt and failure, over something that never happened. I would try to reason with my own head during the day, trick my own brain... But it's almost two years later, and I'm still smoke free. There has never been a situation where I've thought ""this is too stressful - I need a smoke"" because I forced all those stressful situations on myself in the first month.

Along the way, it felt great to keep dates in mind. Announcing that it had been a year without a cigarette was a great feeling. I don't know if this advice will help you, but maybe it will shed light on another method. I wish you luck. If you really want it, you can absolutely do it. Keep trying.""Congrats to you guys who've done it, no matter a day or 10 years. I actually quit over the summer for 6 weeks. Longest I ever went. Felt great but then one night after a friend's wedding, I bummed one and it was like I never quit. Took about 2 weeks before I was back to a pack a day.

I sincerely believe it's all about being ready to quit. If you're not ready and try, you'll most likely fail. Just trying to find the will power to get to that point again where I say, ""I'm ready"", but for much longer than 6 weeks I hope.""My grandma was a smoker for 40 years. She stopped after she had brain surgery. Nothing in the brain was affected, she just couldn't smoke in the hospital. It got annoying to keep having to get up and go outside to smoke, so she just quit.""Honestly. What worked for me was taking it one day at a time.
 The first day was terrible. I was irritable , moody and just an asshole. But fuck if I was going to give up, I mean I knew I could make it one day. 

Day 2 was also bad, but I wasn't going to let myself go through all that shit the day before for nothing. So I manned up and plowed through the second day.

I kept using each days struggles to fuel my stubbornness to give up. Eventually after a week, the cravings were going away and I finally knew I was getting somewhere. 

The hardest part, honestly, was breaking the other habits I had. Like going outside on my breaks at work. And going out to bars. I avoided bars for the first like 2 months. 

Doesn't mean i still didn't struggle after that. But 1 month turned into 2. 2 into 6. And before you know it. It's been 3 years since my last cigarette. "Stop being a fucking bitch. "My father died from smoking related issues. When he was on his way out he made me promise to do so. 

It took me a while, but I finally did it. After I promised, I knew it was something I was going to do. 

The trick is to wait until you have that one cigarette that doesn't quite taste right, and you don't quite want it. You put that one out, and then you go cold turkey. That's how it worked for me at least. Of course, I had a motivator that most would not understand."My best friends dad's terminal lung cancer."Think about your current or future children.

You owe it to them to be around for as long as you can.""dumb luck.  and gift incentives from girlfriend such as beer, candy, and eventually a playstation 3.

I had told a friend of mine I worked with, ""Hey guess what happened yesterday?"" She asked, what? I responded, ""I ran out of cigarettes last night and I'm not going to buy anymore."" She said Cool.  Then 20 minutes later I'm leaving work and I'm like, I'm definitely gonna go buy some cigarettes.

When I parked my car, I got out and saw my co-worker walk around the corner of the convenience store. She had been dropping something off across the street and happened to walk around the corner so I was not expecting to see her and she immediately knew what I was up to.

So I bought some dark chocolate M&M's and a coca cola and walked off to the car after feeling ashamed of myself.

After that, I quit. I still have one cigarette left in my computer desk drawer. Has been there for like 4 years now come February something. And I still have my PS3.  Woohoo!

Anything you want enough to quit smoking in exchange for it?

EDIT: The girlfriend also became my wife so she doesn't want me smoking so I don't. I also have the promise made that when I'm 65 and there's no kids in the house I can start smoking again.  For the occasional fix, I would go to a hookah bar. Similar feeling, but doesn't trigger the same cigarette needs and habits so that helped. Also, I'm only 26, but I look forward to 65. can't wait. And yes, that simple of a promise is important to me. It means I can smoke later in life, when I want to. Right now, I'm in control of right now.""First identify why you want to quit. If one of your main reasons isn't ""because I want to"" you are going to have a rough time.

1) decide when you are ready to quit for you, and nothing else.
2) go cold turkey, no e-cigs, just straight up quit.
3) survive the first few weeks, for me I mentally associated smoking and the smell of cigarettes with a whole bunch of negative things to the point that after a few days, smelling cigarettes would make me gag.
4) never ever smoke again. it's scary because just 1 cig can cause a full relapse. I had been cig free for over a year and relapsed off just one. One turned into once a weekend, turned into one pack a day, and took me another 2 years before I kicked it again. Currently going on 5 years now and I will never ever risk having a cigarette again."I am woman. Smoked for 15 years. The payoff for me was to put my head inside my blouse everyday when I got home from work and smell freshness and the soap and lotion I put on 10 hours earlier. It became my payoff and I began to realize just how disgusting and dirty and stinky I used to be. I was clean now and never wanted to be filthy again.The patch and suckers is what worked for me. "It started when I started to pay attention to my cigarettes. Instead of playing on my phone, or talking to someone or letting my brain think about anything, I focused on the cigarette and how it made me feel. Like how it hurt my throat, how it smelled, how I felt after, and really focused on if I felt the relief I was looking for. I discovered that I really don't enjoy smoking, I like the idea of it, but the act of it really isn't as enjoyable as I thought it was. So I woke up one morning and decided I didn't want a cigarette, so I rolled with it and it's been almost 3 months now. I don't know that it's a method that would work for anyone else, but hey its worth a shot. As well as realizing that it has never cured my boredom, or helped me manage my stress, it just helped me to get away from what was stressing me for 5 minutes, and take away the stress of craving nicotine."Realised I wanted my health more than the next cig. Nothing besides my own midset got me through. After the first week I stopped getting cravings altogether.It seems there is a lot of different ways to quit. I remember the best thing about quitting was how soon I noticed a change in my health. Within a week my lungs felt much clearer and that was enough to get me through those nagging cravings.Anatabloc helped so much. It sounds so silly but those mint things were amazing!"An eCig really helped me out in the shortrun when I had to stop after my daughter was born. I can't say it's not unhealthy at all, but it's a better alternative for now. I found a site where you can choose the nicotine strength, so I've been slowly backing it down since then. ""I started when i was 14 and im 18 now, so all i needed was the will power and my back of my fathers hand to quit. "I posted this exact same thing a month ago and didn't make front page :(I ended up thinking about what I was actually doing... setting fire to something then sucking in this smoke... for what? I mean seriously when you break it down doesn't it just seem like the stupidest thing ever? Quit smoking weed the same way."This may be a little to late in this discussion with 12,000+ comments but I gave up after my lung collapsed when I was 26 after smoking 20+ a day for 13 years.  I am now 40 and while I am still not 100%, cravings are a thing (almost) of the past. "Tripping on acid made cigarettes disgusting to me. I still smoke when Im drunk and hanging out with friends who smoke but most of them have quit now.  While I still smoke a cigarette once a month or so I still consider myself as having successfully quit. I don't particularly care about being 100% nicotine free."Chantix, a pregnant wife and a lot of self control. 

4 years and I still crave a butt when drinking. "It's all in your head. You have to really want to quit! Do it cold and tough it out. It's been 13 years for me!"Smoking two packs of cloves one weekend about 6 months after I had initially quit. I could not speak again for a week, and my job requires me to speak. I was in horrific pain and nearly lost a week of business.

It just never seemed appealing again.

My boyfriend quit because I told him that I could not move in with him unless he did so. In the time since I quit, I've developed a severe allergy to tobacco smoke. He wanted me more than the nicotine.""it was a combination of things. not wanting too anymore, and ""having to"" because of the addiction was a big one. The SO quitting with me was a big one, and the use of Chantix. It help a LOT to cut the urges. It was still hard, but i have been smoke free for almost 3 years.""smoking half cigarettes at a time instead of a full one. this allowed me to cut back to half of what i smoked, and then soon a quarter of what i smoked, and then cold turkey. i found i was still fully satisfied with half a cig. oh and truly, truly wanting to quit.""Hypnosis. Not kidding. Whether it was placebo effect or not, I haven't touched a cigarette since and I have no desire to. Also, if you're going the e-cig route, I pray that you did not buy a blu or something like it. Go to a  vaping store if there's one on your area!"I started with the patch but kept forgetting to change it...I also chewed on cinnamon sticks. Gross looking but they are the same size as a cigarette and helped me through it My grandpa actually quit by going to see a hypnotist"e-cigs. those things are wonderful, tasty, and they're healthy compared with analog cigarettes. satisfies not only the crave for nicotene but also the feeling of smoking. ""If you hang out with other smokers, try making a bet and all quit at the same time. It really worked for me and now all five of us are three months strong. ""I basically just decided I needed to do it and I have the kind of willpower only clinically bullheaded people have.  At a little over a pack a day habit. No patches or pills or anything to drag out the withdraw. I just accepted that it would suck a lot and kept telling myself it got easier. The first three days were rough, but it got easier every day. I think I ate 7 pounds of hard candies. After a month or so it seemed laughable when I got a craving. Now I still get one when I am under extreme stress but its even more laughable. I'm about to hit 2 years without a puff. 

TLDR: I ate a lot of Blow-Pops and accepted the suck. ""Electronic cigarettes. Yes, it's still nicotine. But it's enormous harm reduction. I remind myself of that whenever I run free and easy on the treadmill at the gym. 

I tried cold-turkey, the patch, the gum, even Snus. Horrible stuff, Snus. I quit for a year once. I missed them every day of that year, and eventually it wore me down. But the ecigs? It was... easy. I've used them for ten months, steadily weakening the nicotine dose as I go. I haven't even been tempted to go back. 

I got a lot of help from the people right [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/). ""Basically I got fed up with trying to quit and decided to really quit. 
Every time I felt like having a cigarette I would say to myself that this will pass and every time I have this craving I know that the next one is going to be further away and have less strength and that I have made the decision that I would no longer smoke cigarettes so the cravings can be damned. Other times I would say to myself that I was just moving from a false reality of being a smoker to the new true reality of being a non smoker, and that every time I accepted my new true reality it would get easier to leave the old style of thinking and beliefs behind. I made it easier for myself if I could by keeping away from any smokers, If someone lit up around me I would move or leave for a while, stopped going to clubs/bars, told any friend smokers to go outside to smoke, stopped drinking alcohol for the time as well (since I used to socially smoke a lot), and started rewarding myself for positive behaviour in better ways than having a cigarette. 
But if I had to say what was the real difference between the 100 times before I tried to stop and the one time I actually did stop (and im still a non smoker these many many years later). It was ONE simple thing.

I decided I was a non smoker.""E-Cig did it for me. I got a reaaaal low nicotine dose so I could have big pulls without the heart racing crap. Haven't touched them since, and I feel amazing."e cigarettes"First step for me was to not place importance on the cigarettes or the date I quit. I smoked for 10 years, a pack every other day, and the moment I realised that I was placing too much value on a disgusting item I just stopped. Don't get me wrong, the first few days I was irritable, but that fades with some self control. I remember the month I quit (April) because I bought a road bicycle and started riding all the time...girls on jogging/cycling paths in workout clothes> smelly smokers. I'm nearly a year off cigarettes and I'll never go back. I just kept telling myself they're not important and as  time went by I just stopped caring about them. Mind over matter, good luck to you!"I was put on an antidepressant called wellbutrin. I believe it is the same medical ingredients as zaiban (sp?) which is for quitting smoking. It made it taste so horrible that i was done in about a week. That was about 8 yrs ago"Almost four years ago I went cold turkey, after being what one person called ""the most pro-active smoker in the world.""  I loved smoking, for 17 years, and would chain-smoke at every opportunity.  I tried quitting a few times, but any time any stressful event happened, it sent me right back to it.  I could not cut down, it was an all-or-nothing thing.

I also used smoking as the only way to take a break at work.  I took a couple of days off so I had a long weekend, and basically laid on my couch like I was ill most of the time.  I ate anything I wanted, but I did not allow myself to go outside for any reason.  It sucked, but it gave me enough of a head start to get the nicotine out of my system before having to work.  

Good luck!  You can do it!"Running. I'd run hard enough to punish myself. Quit cold turkey about one week in. I smoked a pack a day."I quit after 7-8 of smoking and smoked about half a pack a day. 
When I went to University, I got really interested in a career in healthcare so I took a bunch of human biology classes and WOW. 
Once I learned what smoking actually does to your body, how important all your organs are, and how delicate the balance of their functions are, I quit, and it was easy.
I mean, the risk of getting sick without smoking is so high that I really began to feel stupid for being a smoker. It was all mental for me. 

Basically, after a few months of realizing that I have to quit, I woke up one morning and said to myself, ""I'm not going to smoke anymore"". And that was  pretty much it. Aside from a few drunken stoppers and that amazing after meal cigarette, I was pretty much done.
It was one year last November. =D"LSDI started doing freediving and I knew I couldn't progress as quickly if I didn't stop smoking. Before that I always wanted to quit and was constantly making bets with friends for not smoking for a week or two. The bets usually involved  couple hundred bucks with each friend. So it would usually cost me around $600-$1000 to smoke and if I didn't smoke for that period my friends wouldn't owe me money. "Also in healthcare. I quit 3 years ago using an vape/ecig. I got the strongest level of nicotine, where just a few drags would kill the nicotine craving. I'd hide in the med room or bathroom, take a few drags whenever I felt like it. I quit going outside, because that was a problem for me.  Also, I found myself just naturally tapering off the ecig and found I didn't need it by about six months later.
In one month, I will have been cigarette free for 3 years. I have never smoked another cigarette since I quit. I'm so happy I quit. 
Make sure you get a quality product, and don't skimp on the nicotine. Then make a commitment to yourself to quit. No fear, you have a pacifier right there if you need it. Also, remember that most people have to try many times before they quit. So, don't feel bad about the times that you haven't made it. Those were all necessary practice for your big success. Good luck!"i switched to high end tobacco (pipe tobacco/cigars) and DID NOT INHALE. once i developed a taste for it cigarettes started to disgust me. i also started running and that makes cigarettes even nastier. the difference between cigars and cigarettes is that cigars dont give you cravings and taste nice. but you have to NOT INHALE. i've been cigarette free for 8 months and i find the smell/taste of cigarettes putrid. i smoke cigars (usually tiny ones i.e. cohiba clubs or montecristo minis) 3-4 times a month on average. "No ephinany just don't quit quitting. Most people fail to quit many times prior to a successful quit, do not abandon hope that you can quit.""Wanting to. I quit cold turkey. Took me several tries quit for a few weeks quit for a couple months quit for a year. This time it's been 3 years!! Believe it or not, I still from time to time get cravings for one."Went on a hideous drug bender and chain-punched a whole 50g pouch of tobacco in about 12 hours... quit the next day with poo-for-brains and the breathing capacity of a lung cancer patient. "Nicorette Quickmist

its vile but it does break the hand to mouth action""get an electronic cigarette that actually gives you the same throat burn a regular cigarette does. That's the key to replacing cigs effectively. I quit smoking the day my e-cig arrived in the mail, July 2nd, 2009, 4pm."E-Cig took me from a pack a day to nothing in like a week.  You have to want to use it.  Its not the same.  But I think its better."I am glad that tons of people will wind up quitting because of something they read here. 

Also, my short answer to the questions: Carr, plus the patch if you really need it (but you probably don't).""2 packs down to nothing here, for one week I had enough money to buy food but not enough to buy cigarettes.

To stop I recommend you to get chewing gums and every time you want or think of cigarette just put gum in your mouth and even if you have one already in your mouth just take another one(gum not cigarette) or eat.

After a while you might also(and probably will) get serious food cravings, when this happens eat what ever you can and want, because you need to get your brain dopamine 
reward system used of the lack of nicotine. Don't be afraid of getting fat you can lose weight that you gained later.

Usually when you get the need to smoke your time will stretch and 5 minutes will appear to be 30 minutes, always clock with you, and when this happens do something, if you are at work when you think or want to smoke don't take any breaks or go away from your work for no reason other than your work.

In first month you will also get stressed and nervous a lot, do stuff I wrote above, personal relaxation techniques are very good at dealing with stress and being nervous because of cigarettes.

And for e-cigarettes STAY AWAY FROM THEM, people are not aware that e-cigarettes usually contain higher amounts of nicotine than classic cigarettes and they get more addicted, I think this is what is happening to you.

Current are: 23 years old
Why: I liked and still do like the smell of cigarettes

"start vaping!Wife told me we were having a baby and it was time to quit."I began vaping. Did that for a good 3 weeks with no problem, then one night, I got extremely wasted and lost my $90 E-cig. After that, it was tough not to by cigarettes. "Cold turkey"I switched to e-cigs for about 2 years. The ""pull"" of nicotine withdrawal was still there, however, I noticed it wasn't like with a real cig. I still ""needed"" the e-cig nicotine, however, when I quit that it seemed easier than all the thousands of times I tried quiting regular cigs alone. 

Some argue that you're also addicted to other ingredients in a reg cig. I agree. I remember when I would run out of e-cig juice( the kind you fill your e cig with instead of buying disposable) I would get a pack of reg cigs. Once I was on those for even one day it was different than just the nicotine in the e-cigs juice that I used. 

All that being said, I still had to really just want to frigging quit. It was hard. It just got easier each day and week. ""I promised my infant girl I would quit smoking so that I could see her grow up, help her find her way in life, watch as she falls in love and be there at her wedding. I actually said the words aloud to her and made the promise. I quit cold turkey. The idea of having another smoke fills me with the guilt of being a liar to my daughter and a bad father. The quitting has always been easy for me, it's the never having another cigarette for the rest of my life that's hard. My daughter, unknowingly, keeps me going..."Why is the top comment deleted? I fucking hate that. Reddit: please leave comments when a user deletes!!!!!!!"Fear! One of my friends had a heart attack at 33 and I quit the next day. He has always been fit, exercises, eats right... Only thing he had going against him was smoking. Well that and bad genes. I found out later he came from a long line of heart problems.

That scared the crap out of me and I never wanted another cigarette, except while drinking for the first year. My wife and other friends kept smoking but that never bothered me. Now all my friends have quit too and I can drink without wanting a cigarette. 
""Cold Turkey.  I just decided to stop, waited until the time was right and did it.  I had a supply of chocolate, and smoked mullen when I had serious cravings.  I was an asshole to everyone for a while.  I had a smokers hack for two years after I quit.  

It was one of the hardest things I have ever done.

I can never smoke another cigarette, ever.  I know one will lead to many and then I will have to go through quitting again."Mindset change. Realizing that nicotine kills"my friend that quit smoking told me some good advice - ""every time you want a cigarette, just force yourself to eat one. you'll quit real quick""""Little seven year old me kept telling my mom that if she didn't quit smoking, she would die. And who would take care of me? She quit soon after and has been clean for 12+ years. 

Edit: I missed a word.""Getting pregnant.  Now if that's not an option....here's a twist to my story.  When my son was about 2 or 3 I started back up again.  It was stupid.  Anyway.. I only smoked about 6 months.  In that time I had gotten bronchitis 2-3 times.  On a visit to the doctor, he told me candidly after a lung function test, that if I didn't quit smoking, I would likely not see 30.  I was 23 years old.  I wanted to see my son grow up so I quit cold turkey and have never ever looked back.

I'm also in health care (nurse practitioner) and this week I saw a woman who was 50 who was full of lung cancer.  She will die this year.  I see people everyday with COPD (a terrible lung disease -90+% of sufferers are/were smokers).  These two things alone, affirm my decision to quit.  

Good luck. (if you ever see this)""It is all mental, just stop and keep a picture of cancer lungs on your phone when you need a fix!""Getting so sick that I was bed-ridden for two weeks, ill for three. Standing up made me vomit, so obviously i wasn't smoking. By the time I was well enough to smoke again, I didn't want to anymore. That being said, once you have been a smoker, you are never done quitting, you have to be ever vigilant or your dick head brain will trick you into having one. ""My parents always hated smokers, so were less than happy to find out I smoked. I told them I quit a while ago, whenever I go home to visit I just stop smoking while I'm there. It's surprisingly easy since I can just chill out while I'm there rather than worry about work, I miss it but I don't feel nearly as bad as if I stopped smoking while alone. 
Maybe try quitting when you visit your folks?""I only smoked for two years in college, but I smoked a carton a week for those two years. One morning I decided to play basketball for the first time in years and it was awful. Just hacking up a lung, couldn't breathe, all around miserable. I turned to my roommate and said ""I'm not going to smoke anymore"". And that was it. It's been 13 years. ""Went to nicotine gum.  It worked GREAT  . . . but it was a nicotine substitute.  I chewed the gum for six years.  Finally, I quit cold turkey (gum that is) and I was fine in 1 week.  The trick for me (many, many failed attempts beforehand) was to separate out the two addictions (physical to the nicotine and phycological as well).  "I wanted to quit more than I wanted to smoke"Honestly?  Whatever the fuck is wrong with me right now.  I was a caregiver for a few years and know exactly how it is to be constantly ""on.""  You can't even piss in peace, much less take an actual break.  I had tried quitting several times, but it wasn't until I had a constant pain in my lower right chest/upper right abdomen that I actually had the willpower to do anything about it.  And then it was just really, really easy to quit.  I was done willfully contributing to my own misery, you know?  That was back in September.  The pain has gotten worse, which has helped the few times I've been a little tempted to light up again.""Willpower. Smoked for 19 years (age 11 - 30), 2+ packs per day.  Woke up one morning and said I quit. Every time I craved a cigarette I just told myself no. It's really not that hard. There's only two reasons people don't quit. They either don't really want to quit, or they are too weak minded to control themselves."I successfully quit smoking cigarettes by replacing them with Jolly Ranchers. Every time I wanted to smoke a cigarette I would have a Jolly Rancher. Eventually I stopped wanting cigarettes and Jolly Ranchers are much easier to quit than cigarettes. "The Nicotrol Inhaler. It was free through my insurance. Figured it would be pretty ridiculous to pay for cigs when I could get almost the same experience for free. Then after about a month, I just naturally stopped reaching for the inhaler. 5 months cig free after 16 yrs smoking. Not a single cheat and rarely even the briefest craving. ""Push-ups. Every time I felt like smoking, I did 20 push ups instead. I'd throw in squats, leg-lifts, etc for balance, but push-ups seemed the most convenient and effective.

When push-ups weren't reasonable to perform, I'd reassure myself that I'd have a cigarette soon, and just keep putting it off until I forgot about it. Just procrastinate it away. Or, if the cravings persisted, I'd wait and wait and finally treat myself to that cigarette.

In push-up form.""Wellbutrin.  

Smoked for 14 years, dipped for 3.  I'm at 7 months nicotine free.  No vaping or nicotine replacement methods.""Forcing yourself to associate smoking with things that genuinely bother you is a strong method. However, it's not as straightforward as it sounds and requires certain levels of creativity on your part to really take effect. Here are a few self-sabotaging measures I employed that did it for me: 

**a)Sleep Disturbance:** I get to sleep for 5 hours a day due to my job so uninterrupted sleep is a necessary for me. I forced myself to wake up twice every night and smoke a cigarette. The added annoyance was the difficulty of going back to sleep. 

**b)Bad Customer:** Where I live, there's a big penalty for smoking indoors. Although both the smoker and the owner of the venue is fined pretty heavily, owner by far gets the rougher end. In other words, venue owners are not happy to give away a week's earnings due to an annoying customer's addiction. Thus, I became that annoying customer. Now, I'm not really the confrontation type--try to avoid it at all costs. So, firing up a cigarette indoors and waiting for the waiter or owner to show up was mildly uncomfortable--to say the least. The real trick here is to put off the cigarette after the initial warning and light up another one once the waiter walks away. Getting yelled at a few times is a strong source of negative association, but not as negative as anticipation anxiety and the sheer knowledge of doing something douchebag-y that are natural byproducts of this act. 

**c)Wasabi Factor:** I hate wasabi. Its hot, salty,heavy and basically is mouthrape. I found that the small store below my apartment sells this nuts dipped in wasabi. I started carrying them in my mouth and everytime I smoked, a ate a handful of those small pieces of hell. Remember, this is not something I try to avoid but instead, something that truly disgusts me. 

**d)Bitter Symphony:** I hate dubstep. I find that this kind of music has the capacity to mess up many of the songs that I like. So I loaded my iPhone  with Skrillex albums and some shitty remixes. Every time I went for a smoke, I played a song from that playlist. You'd be surprised how the ecstasy of a first breath from a new cigarette can easily be ruined by disturbing other senses. 

**e)Ignorance is Bliss:** Actually, quite the opposite. I started making an exact report of how many cigarettes I smoke. Not like 1.5 half pack or some half-assed guesstimate, the actual number. I added up the numbers every week. Whatever the final number came up to, I wrote that many times, in my evernote app on iPhone, like a child being punished by his first grade teacher, the following phrase: I smoked x many cigarettes this week and I feel shitty about it. In addition to the obvious degrading nature of the task, typing on iPhone is a torture by itself. Repeat that 300 times (which was my usual yield) and you start questioning things :) 

Like a I said in the beginning, these were a few things that worked for me and may or may not apply to you. You gotta find your unique tickoff tasks and throw smoking in there. Once you stick with it, you could find yourself having a more difficult time justifying those small packs. Good luck buddy.  "This has made me really not want to pick up smoking"I started smoking at the age of 12 (21 years).  About a month ago I switched to an e-cigarette.  I've had absolutely NO urge to smoke tobacco since.  If you're still smoking tobacco then you need to increase your nicotine blend or change your equipment.  Switch it up - and just keep trying until you find something that works!

Granted, I still intake nicotine, but according to my research the health effects are significantly decreased.  In addition, if I wanted to (I don't have any urge to do so at this time) I could slowly decrease the nicotine level in my blend and quitting would be easier.

Just some thoughts.  Seriously, best of luck to you.""My dad got esophageal cancer stage 3. He was never a smoker or a drinker, just terrible shitty luck. Hearing him cry on the phone when he told me put a bullet in my desire to ever smoke again.

I have responsibilities to my siblings and the rest of my family. This battle is too brutal to tempt my future fate.""Trust me..  one thing that does not work for sure is by lowering the frequency you smoke slowly.. like today you smoke 10 a day, and you set a goal that from 2 days onwards you will smoke 9 and so on.

that doesnt work because then you'll have cheat days sometimes when you go out or have a stressful day.. because you arleady smoke 9 so you'll be like ah whatever one more.. and then next day you may think aah i smoke 10 yest so just one more day.. and it keep going on.

i quite smoking cold turkey.. weeks before quitting i started to tell myself how much i hated the smell. I started noticing people that smoke and how bad they smell. The cig smell is just part of them at all times. I started thinking.. ""i dont smoke"" should be the new cool thing.. Everyone smokes around me and im the one of the only few people in my social circle who doesnt smoke. Im the ODD one out- but i think to myself that its in a good way. People appreciate that i dont have the need to smoke. 

point of the story.. Cold turkey works best""I switched to a decent electronic cigarette about 3 months ago and haven't smoked a real cig since. I purchased the large battery and hook it up to charge every night before I go to sleep. I also keep a car charger in my glove box to make sure my battery doesn't die. Instead of going for candy options or fruity flavors, I buy 'cigarette flavors' like Turkish tobacco or a light menthol. I think these flavors help really imitate cigarette taste for me. 
If you're not ok still remaining a slave to nicotine this obviously isn't the option for you. I have heard of people buying a mid grade nicotine level liquid and gradually downgrading (I.e. 18mg to 9mg eventually to 0) which probably helps out with the habitual aspect like puffing after meals.
I think the ecigs that use propylene glycol are a great innovation because you eliminate all the carcinogens and toxins that come along with traditional combustion derived smoking. I can also vape right before a stressful business meeting or at home (with a wife who hates smoking) and there's no nasty odor or cough. I don't get smokers cough or upper respiratory infections anymore either..""Hypnosis, 10 years smoke free. Had no cravings and would never smoke again. "LSD.  I've seen it happen first hand to many other of my friends too.  Most people find it hard to believe.  Don't allow yourself to be fooled by your ignorance."Exercise, I immediately stopped after I started to see small gains. I hate doing things when I feel like it was for nothing, I wanted to maximize my physical gains while exercising. Perhaps I replaced an addiction for another addiction, not sure. I just know it's been 2 years since my last smoke. ""I know I'm a bit late to the show but I hope you get to read this. 

This is something which isn't available to everyone because of work and responsibility restrictions, but of you're able to, I highly recommend doing a fast. 

In short, I smoked for 2 years, mum smoked for 30. She's always had the excuse of constant stress to not stop. She never lasted more than a few days. 

We've now both stopped (knock on wood) since we went on a fast. Only water for 12 days, you can do it for less time but around 14 days is suggested. Note that we did this in controlled conditions with medical professionals who guided us the whole way. Sounds crack pot and as a student I needed a fair bit of convincing but, it worked.

You don't think about it afterward, its an easy way out In my opinion, as long as you can last those two weeks, you're through with cigarettes. 

PS. This wasn't the primary aim of the fast, just a nice little side effect! Good luck man."Not me personally but ive had pack a day smoker friends who quit with electronic cigarettes. As far as I know they are safe."I think stubbornness helped my dad. 

He had been smoking plenty since 14 years of age. One day, sometime in his late 40s I asked him if he was addicted to cigarettes. He seemed shocked and said no; I can stop anytime I want. I said ok. We had a little bit if a state of.

He hasn't smoked since. About 7/8 years now.""Do Chantix if you haven't already.  I'm in health care too (grad student and can't just leave the bench on a whim).  With most health insurance, it's free.  I was hesitant about taking it, but after a week of taking it and still being able to smoke (per how it works), I just quit and didn't look back.  I quit taking it after 3 weeks because it was really screwing with my stomach, but didn't have weird dreams or mood swings.  It just makes you not want to smoke.....Tried the e-cig, just ended up smoking real ones because it wasn't the same.  Good luck to you man, i'm 1 1/2 years cig free and it's awesome.  ""Just stop. Tapering off is bullshit, won't work. Pick a day and just stop. Every time you think about cigarette, every time you see one on tv, every time you see someone with a cigarette, you do something else. What worked for me was chewing tobacco, then I did the same thing with that, replacing chew with gum. Even if a little breeze goes across your brain that whispers tobacco, do that other thing. Every time! Don't slack and think just this one. 
This is what worked for me. You will have to use discipline and do it every fucking time. I've been chewing nicotine gum for about a year. Will I quit that? Dunno. But I am safer now that I was.""i just stopped completely. no e-cig. no ""just one a day"". It doesn't work, crush the pack and find a gum brand you enjoy.""I had to actually want to quit. It sounds simple, but at one point, I realized that I still wanted to smoke. Once I realized that, it was easier for me to change what I wanted. That and my doctor said I could develop full-blown emphysema at 25 if I kept smoking. (bad lungs)""My non smoking wife was 3 months pregnant; I went cold turkey while changing jobs from all smoking environment to no smoking at all.   For five years I would almost start again but I didn't want my son to see me smoking.  He's 22 now....and uses a hash oil vaporizer.   I never smoked again, but I do eat too much. lol."logic.Had my last one during a heart attack in 1988.Fall in love with a non-smoker.It was a combination of things for me. First I set a date when I was going to quit. I choose a month from the day I decided to quit. I also had most of my friends who supported and backed me with my decision. The final and most important thing that help me was smoking as many cigarettes as I could possibly handle the night before I quit. At 11:50 the night before I sat out on my porch and smoked one after another until I thought I was going to throw up. This may sound stupid but it helped me immensely with the initial cravings. I did not even consider smoking a cigarette until around day five or six and by then the craving was not nearly as bad. I have been smoke free for about three months now and don't even think about it anymore. Best of luck to you."While driving across the country with a friend I packed a double horseshoe of dip and started working my way through a pack or Marlboros. About a quarter of the way through the pack my upper lip and hairline started to sweat, and by the time half the pack was gone I was puking into a Subway sandwich bag. I wanted to stop then, but with my friend's help I kept smoking until I vomited again 3/4 of the way through the pack. I remember the look on the truckers face next to us as he watched mu puke into a bag.
Later that day I was craving nicotine again, but because I had put so much work  into it already, I never picked them up again. ""I didn't tell anyone I was going to do it. I just decided I wasn't a smoker after my last cigarette left me a little nauseated after smoking for several years. It was a private decision that I never vocalized to any of my friends. I'm not sure why, but sometimes setting and announcing some big ultimatum for yourself to everyone you know can have an adverse effect of making the task seem impossible and absolutely undo-able. ""Smoking is always a negative action. There is no ""relief"" when it comes to smoking, just constant denial that ""I like this"" or that ""I need this."" Even the idea that you can't go outside on your break and not smoke is more denial and excuses that you make for yourself. Smoking creates, pardon the pun, a black cloud of denial, guilt, and general unhappiness. There's no such thing as a victory cigarette.

I had nasty asthma symptoms and barely a dime to my name because of smoking. I would break off arrangements with friends and cancel dates because I was too sick to go outside. But what would I do? Smoke. Smoke and smoke again. It didn't matter if I would halfheartedly say I should quit, because I never meant it. Even after a night in the hospital, I needed that break cigarette.

I quit cold turkey. I quit by being true to myself, by reminding myself that this ""thing"" is a drug and it's controlling my life. I realized that I wasn't happy, that smoking was constantly on my mind. I tallied up how much I spent on smoking and invested it into a hobby(for me, game collecting, for you it could be anything). For the first time in my life for a long time, since way before I started smoking, I was happy.

I started improving other parts of my life too, and it all started when I stopped lying to myself that I need this addiction, that I can't quit it. You may think you're happy, but honestly whenever you a tied to an addiction you'll never truly be happy. You'll always need that ""break,"" and it will never end. If you just admit you have a problem, and that cigarettes aren't beneficial in any way, then you're on the path to quitting(going on 2 years here).

**tldr: Quit cold turkey. No e-cigarettes. No excuses. Use that money you waste on a hobby or something(or someone) that makes you happy.**""My mom insisted I read Allen Carr's easy way to stop smoking because it worked for her and the person who referred her. My boyfriend, brother and most my friends smoked, in fact I was the worst of the lot and  every activity somehow centered around smoking and I had no desire or intention to quit. Eventually I read the book to placate her and figured she wouldn't press the issue anymore once I had given it a go. 

It was incredible, I thought it was stupid all the way through but by the last page I was done smoking
-no will power, no regret, no weight gain and all that. I just stopped and I was happy to have given it up. That was 4 years ago. 

I now refer the book to everyone and believe the only way it doesn't work is if you don't finish it! 

http://allencarr.com""My health, family and friends are what helped me quit. One time I was sick and couldn't breathe well at all...(on top of that I had lung surgery before I even started smoking)... I imagined that this what it would be like when I got older and continued to smoke.  I gave it up after smoking daily for 8 years. I want to be around for a while and see wife, family and friends grow.  I've even got my wife to quit smoking!!""I quit cold turkey about a year and 3 months ago. I would say don't use gum/patches, it's best to get all the nicotine out of your system as soon as possible. ""tapering off"" just makes it harder since you still give yourself some nicotine, which just makes you want more. 
"Chantix!I started smoking spliffs insteadCinnamon tee tree toothpicks. Carried with me in my pocket and at work during smoke breaks i would pop one in and be golden. Didnt hurt that my dentist said he saw an improvement in my gum health either plus nice fresh breath. "I think what it came down to for me was just a willingness to be better. In highschool, I used to be athletic. I played soccer and wrestled. one day in college after I had been smoking for a few years, I tried to go running and could barely make it 3/4 mile. I realized at that point that I wanted to be better than that. I still smoke from time to time when I'm drinking or in social circumstances, but I will never be a smoker again. 

If your trigger is work, I would suggest switching to something like cigarillos or anything where you dont inhale, but still get to partake in the act of smoking. I realized that a big part of the addiction, at least for me, was not about nicotine, but more about the act of smoking. good luck."Champix"Vaping. It seriously is the next best thing, though it's not FDA approved. I'm still waiting for a random finger or toe to start growing."Ecig"Marijuana.  I bought some, ""mid grade"" quality and smoked a joint whenever I got the uncontrollable urge to smoke something.  You get pretty blasted and not really in the best way because the pot quality isn't the best.  Haven't smoked since 2005.""Finding someone I liked more than smoking. I knew she didn't approve and that was good enough for me, now I'm happily married to my soul mate and cigarette free!""Honestly, exercise. I would go running while trying to quit and the smoking made it difficult to complete the shortest of distances. My desperation for being healthy and knowledge that cardio would be damn near impossible while smoking forced my decision. ""I smoked 30 cigarettes a day for almost 15 years. I quit eventually with a quality electronic cigarette. I initially had a terrible experience with them, because I didn't know much about them and got ripped off. I did a search on ""best e-cig"" and found a top 10 list of e-cigs, and all of them were cigarette lookalikes, or as we vapers call them, ""cigalikes"". They are all garbage and a complete waste of money. 

I ordered a starter kit from the #1 on that site, and within a few weeks, both batteries died, and I went through so much of a hassle trying to get my $70 refunded, I eventually gave up. I then found another site, again, that listed a bunch of cig-a-likes. I ordered a different brand that was supposed to be very good. The same exact thing happened. And this one had a warranty supposedly. I didn't read the fine print, and to get a refund, I would have to pay around $30 for shipping and handling just to send my starter kit back and get a replacement, even though in the large print it said ""Free warranty"". I said fuck it, and went back to smoking for a few months.

Then I came across /r/electronic_cigarette. I asked a few questions, told them my experience, and I quickly learned that all the cig-a-likes are ripoffs that don't work well. I named my price range, and someone recommended a setup for me, and even listed the website to order the different pieces from (just a battery and a few tanks). In total it cost me about $80, and I have not touched a cigarette for one year and five days now. The higher quality e-cigs that don't look like cigarettes are amazing. All you need to do after you order your battery, tanks, charger, and e-liquid, is purchase coils and e-liquid on a monthly basis, which costs me a total of $40 per month. Compare this to the $250+ I was paying per month for regular cigarettes, and I have saved a shitload of money, even after wasting a total of about $120 on those two ripoff e-cigs before. Combine that with the health benefits of not smoking regular cigarettes, food tasting better, my breath and clothes smelling better, you really can't go wrong.

Trust me on this, check out /r/electronic_cigarette and ask questions. The people there are incredibly helpful, and when I got my quality e-cig, it didn't take a lot of willpower to quit. You really feel the nicotine buzz from the good e-cigs, and your urge to smoke a regular cigarette is gone. You know how when you wake up and have your first cigarette in the morning, you get a little lightheaded and buzzed for a few moments after finishing the cigarette? Four puffs from my iTaste MVP at 4.0 volts and I get the same exact feeling. 

I started out at 24mg nicotine juice (the e-liquid is delicious by the way, you can choose from tons of different flavors, some sites even let you mix your own juice), and I am now down to 18mg. I am gradually tapering my nicotine dosage lower and lower. You can really taste e-liquid too, and it smells fantastic as well. I like fruity flavors, and they taste and smell sweet and fruity. By far the best decision I have made for my health ever. Give it a try, the good e-cigs work REALLY well, and I was a hardcore cigarette addict.""Cold-turkey backed up by solid will-power.  Was the same with every other substance I used to put into my body.  I am now completely clean.  It was very, very hard, and takes time, but it is so worth it.""The thing that worked for me was nicotine lozenges. Kind of the same oral fixation and i found cherry ones that were oddly tasty. But i also really wanted to quit and after a couple years of trying and fighting with my wife over it, I finally hit a point where continuing to smoke just wasn't worth all the hassle. 

Reading through all of these stories, you can see the secret to quitting is having a reason that is more important than the smoking, and its personal to everyone. Breaking the addiction is mostly in your head after a few days, and everyone's reason is personal, as well as their method to stop. You have to be ready, and it isn't easy. Trying and not succeeding isn't to bad as long as you learn what triggered you to go back and avoid it better, if possible anyway. Having a token to look at when you get the cravings also helped me, instead of grabbing a smoke I would fiddle around with my wedding ring or a key chain my wife gave me that had some sentimental value. It helped me remember my reasons for quitting, and the lozenges helped me ease off the physical cravings.""I haven't stopped smoking, it is just I've delayed my next cigarette for going on three years.
""I kept a pack on me at all times.  As someone who has been addicted to many substances, you tend to crave something the most when it's gone and you conserve the most when you are running low. I kept about 5 smokes on me for almost a month after I quit.
""Pure, unaldulterated, hatred.  Hatred of myself for being so weak as to not being able to stop intentionally hurting myself.  I used my withdrawal symptoms as a weapon against myself, rubbing it my own face.  I intentionally hang out with smokers and don't tell them I quit ensuring that they'll smoke around me and sometimes even offer a cigarette.  Then  I have fucked up and abusive conversations in my head just to torture my addict ass.

""Aww, pussy bitch want a ciggy-wiggy?  Does it hurt knowing that you can't enjoy even *one* drag, just to take the edge off?  Well too fucking bad.  Stop being a weak piece of shit and have some fucking self-control.  I hope you fail.  I hope you start again and get throat and ass cancer and you have to live out the rest of your pathetically miserable little life with a squawk box and a colostomy bag.""

The hatred that that inner monologue brings on is more than enough fuel for my determination."Going to Afghanistan for a year without bars. "I smoked on and off for years.  Basically cycled myself down from 'real' ciggs to ultra light ciggs.  Then I grabbed two packages of Red Man Golden Blend.  After I was done both of those packages, i didn't smoke for a year.  I had a pack for shits and giggles at the one year mark, and haven't smoked in 12 years (13 if you don't count that pack).""How do people who don't smoke get a break if they don't step outside and light up?  You've got to stop qualifying these 'mistakes' as it's just an excuse.  The only way to stop is to just stop putting a cigarette to your lips.  


You can wean yourself off using e-cigs or vaping or whatever but the truth is the nicotine craving stops operating after around 72 hours of non-use and after that it's purely in your head.


Perhaps you should set up a positive reinforcement replacement to try and quit."BluI never quit until it was something I actually wanted. Before I knew I should quit but I never wanted to. When I finally wanted to quit it was easy. I became desperate to quit and was willing to try anything and actually able to say no even when I was tempted to have one more. I still want a cigarette every day and even more when someone offers me one. I'd like the excuse to take a break at work and I even like the smell. I like cigarettes more than I like most things but I don't want to smoke a single cigarette for the rest of my life."Smoked for six years. Quit in two weeks.

Smoke cigarette after cigarette. A whole carton if necessary. I'm serious. Until your teeth are fuzzy and you throw up.

I quit by chance. I got bronchitis and the flu at the same time. I didn't want to move, let alone smoke. Those two weeks of sickness were all I needed. 

Also I found the oral fixation part was really what I was addicted to. I always made sure to keep gum, toothpicks, and lollipops on me. When you crave a cigarette just chew or eat one of those things. It helps to have the e-cig too for when you have a nicotine craving. (I quit once before but only for 5 months)

Or... try pot! Having something to smoke everyday helps. :D"/r/stopsmoking helped a good friend of mine."E-cigarette's... I was a heavy smoker and this is what worked for me:

1) Make sure your battery is a passthrough - do not get a battery that isn't a passthrough.

2) Make sure your nicotine level is actually high enough that it scratches the itch. If 18 isn't working, go to 24.

3) Have 2 batteries, and make sure you have a micro-USB basically wherever you go. If that's not feasible get a cheap 1000+ mAh battery charger from like... any cheap website.

4) Get a protank or something similar with changeable wicks and find a local store to make your juice.

5) As to the juice itself, I'd suggest going pure VG for the fluid. Some people get nasally after too much PG (same as fog machine fog juice), it's a common mild reaction. VG is innocuous, as a bonus you get a lot more vapor.

That's about it. Stay stocked up. It's easier to quit when you take away the things that might tempt you. If people are going out to smoke, go with them and only use your ecig. Retrain yourself to use it. If you break down and have the occasional cigarette, don't fret. Just keep at it.

You can always experiment later with different mods and battery types and flavors and wicks blah blah blah. But you want a base of the above to fall back. Smokers are used to having gratification when they want it. Nothing is more frustrating than wanting a cigarette and having a dead battery - the passthrough alleviates that concern.

Stage 4 - Only smoking when out at at work
Stage 5 - Only smoking when out

This was over the space of 3 years and many failed attempts, but I tried hard to not go back to many stages eg smoked at work primarily for 12 months and when I went out (a couple of times a week).

Understanding my triggers and making a gradual change worked for me.""Increase the nicotine dosage of your e-cig.  I switched to vaping with 24mg/ml e-juice.  At that concentration, three to four puffs where as satisfying as a whole cigarette, I had to be careful not to get sick by vaping too much.

I then toned down the dosage gradually because I enjoy the act of smoking and I didn't really want to quit, I just wanted to switch to something less harmful.  I've been down to 12mg/ml for more than a year now.  Lower than that isn't satisfying enough for me and higher than that is too high for me.

If you really want to quit, lower the dosage by steps of 1mg per week or so until you're down to zero.  Many people quit that way.  After a while at zero nic, they start forgetting their vape at home.""COLD TURKEY!!!!! its the only way. you are just feeding the addiction everytime you light one up. cutting back? feeding the addiction..... the first 2 weeks SUCK but then you will feel 1,000,000x better. i know i do. i gained a little weight, but i am able to walk around, jog, hike, and walk up steps without getting winded. and you are a healthcare worker.... you are trading a little 10 minute break for 10 minutes less life. you of all people know what smoking does to people. its just not worth it. you can do this! you are stronger than a little tobacco rolled up in a piece of paper with some FIBERGLASS as a filter. you got this.

Don't have one until you get to work and take that first smoke break. Then once that doesn't bother you, move that first one to after lunch. Eventually you don't have one until after work, then you realize that you might as well just not have one if you can go all day without it. Also I never thought of it as quitting. I'll still smoke when I drink, if I want to. Or right now if I wanted to and who gives a shit. But I slowed down so gradually i eventually enjoyed not smelling like shit more than I enjoyed smoking. Now it's pretty much only when I go to a bar. I still love smoking honestly. I just hate  smelling bad and slowly killing myself. 

PS. I'm talking like gradually over the course of a year too. Don't have one until 10 am for a few months. Then smoking right when you wake up will disgust you. Once that becomes a habit then take another baby step. ""Chantix.  
  
I read through all of the comments looking for this and did not see it. I wish vaping had been a thing (or as popular/accessible as it is now) when I quit, as I think it would have been a preferable method, but Chantix is what did it for me.  
  
I had tried to quit cold turkey, with patches, gum, etc. They would work for a few days up to a couple months, but I'd inevitably smoke again. I spent 1 week on Chantix and cigarettes started tasting weird. After 1.5 weeks, they started tasting like absolute shit. Before two weeks was up, I didn't even bother taking them to work with me and didn't have a desire to pick 'em up when I got home.  
  
Now, the side effects hit some people harder than others. For me, I had a little trouble sleeping and very intense lucid dreams. I slept in another room, away from my wife, for the couple months I was taking Chantix. But all things considered, it was definitely worth it. That feeling the first day of going without cigarettes and you get halfway through the day before realizing you haven't a cigarette all day, hadn't THOUGHT about wanting one, hadn't wanted to strangle someone or jump out of your own skin...it's amazing.""A herbal mixture containing passionflower and lobelia, smoked as an alternative to tobacco.""Others have mentioned in this thread, but Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking is what finally did for my wife and I after multiple attempts at quitting.

Friend JL: A free consult with a hypnotist. He and about 50 other people were shown a film of a spinning spiral, like what was supposed to simulate time travel in old black and white sci-fi films. Over this the hypnotist was repeating, ""Do not say 'I am quitting cigarettes.' Say, ""I do not smoke! I do not smoke! I do not smoke!"" After that one free session, he lost all urge to smoke.

Friend 3: Wellbutrin and nicoderm.

My father: In the early 60s, read a Consumer Reports article on the dangers of smoking and quit cold turkey.

My mother: we never thought we'd see the day, as she was the most inveterate smoker ever, and would get extremely angry and defensive if pressured on the matter. Then after she was diagnosed with emphasema, she started tapering off. She would make herself go outside or to another room to smoke, so that she couldn't just smoke freely all day long. She would only have one cigarette during one of these breaks at a time, which she reduced to a couple of drags. She tried her best to put off having a cigarette break. Finally, after about 6 months, she quit altogether. Soon after she had to start using oxygen 24/7.

Emphasema sucks. Fuck that shit. I know everybody has to go sometime, but taking 5-10 years to strangle to death is a torture nobody deserves.

Get a scrip for Wellbutrin, which helps with impulse control. Keep going to your breaks, because you deserve a break. On your break, do some other addictive activity, like Reddit, Sudoku, a cheezy novel, whatever works for you.""Honestly I used the gum and then just decided, don't have one.  If you have one, you will love it and you will want more. Don't have that first one. 

It hard.  Good luck. ""With my mind!  

---
I negatively associated any unwanted feelings, tastes, etc. that I could, with smoking.  I also couldn't be around people that smoked for a few weeks after quitting.  I still don't go outside when they go for smoke breaks.

---
I was also okay with mini failures.  But I would remember that 72 hours was the actual difficult time period, because you are still physically addicted during that time period.  

---
Assuming you don't use nicotine ""helper"" products like gum or patches which seem like scams to me.  It prolongs your physical addiction.

If you go cold turkey, it only takes 72 hours for it to be out of your system.""When I got engaged to my wife, she told me to quit smoking or she would start. And then she did. Seeing her out to the patio smoking (we never smoked indoors or in vehicles) for those few weeks definitely flipped my switch and I quit. Cold turkey. The first 3 months or so were brutal, I wanted a puff like a teenage boy wants sex. Then it got easier and now it's 14 years. I am so glad, looking at all the skin damage and rotten health of all the men my age who still smoke.
"Pregnancy"$5000 dollar donation to the KKK.  I agreed to send a $5000 donation to the KKK if I smoked again.  I am a black, Jewish man.""My grandmother used to be a smoker. My mother told me that I said something to my grandmother when I was 4-5 years old.

""Granny, why are you killing yourself?""""I smoked for 20+ years and I quit right after New Year's (3 weeks! Woo!) I quit using the patch and an electronic cigarette for those certain times (driving, after eating, etc.) I kept thinking about:
-saving $300/month
-having the lung capacity to walk a flight of stairs
-not smelling like smoke anymore. 

When my wife and I smoked, I never noticed the smell on either of us, but I could sometimes smell other people (especially on elevators). Within two weeks of quitting, my sense of smell came back and I can pick out the smokers from 10 yards away. Seriously, even if you don't quit, just stop for a couple of weeks and you'll notice how bad smokers smell. It's pretty offensive to your non-smoking friends.

TL;DR: Smokers stink.""Breaking the habits/triggers, so i stopped drinking at the same time. I don't drink alcohol any more and i don't smoke. Although at this point i think drinking a glass of wine would not make me smoke again, i prefer to stay abstinent.

It also made me realize how dependent our society is on alcohol and how it dramatically changes personality and behaviour in many people.""Step 1) stop blaming your urge to smoke on the lie that you can only take a break at work to smoke. For one, it's against the law. But more importantly, you're giving yourself a cop out and reason to smoke. Stop being in denial and start realizing you are chemically addicted to nicotine. Do you know what addicts do? They make excuses to take part in their addictive behavior without even recognizing it.

Step 2) Stop buying packs. This is an easy decision. Just don't go buy another pack and you won't have any cigarettes to smoke. Also, don't bum any cigarettes when your out on the town. This is the hardest part, because you're usually influenced by alcohol. My trick was to just stay inside the bar at all costs. Never step out into the smoking section, even if your friends are going out there to smoke.

Step 3) Get on the patch. Go see a doctor for a recommended dose. I quit cold turkey after 5 years of smoking. I failed more than 5 times, but luckily I just became disgusted with the whole process. Every time I got the urge, I would remember how gross it was. Oh, and it kills you. But you don't need me to tell you that.

Good luck.
""I used to be a smoker and an alcoholic. A few years back I tried LSD, it was a much larger dose than I thought I was taking and has an extremely deep and mostly horrifying trip. During that experience I had a great deal of revelations about myself, the world and life. I don't know exactly what happened or changed but the next day when I woke up I went outside put a cigarette in my mouth and just wasn't feeling it, put the cigarette in the ash tray and hit the gym. I did some grocery shopping, picked up a new book and came home. I poured myself a glass of scotch and I finished it and put the bottle away for the first time in years I literally had one drink. I won't try to explain what happened but I just never bought another pack of cigarettes and I drink very moderately now.""I quit just before my daughter was born, so about 5 months now. I used Nicabate mints so I still get the nicotine buzz. They're expensive, but less than cigarettes. Would recommend.""I guess I was never really physically addicted to smoking. I smoked in college, and a little while after, Its hard when many others also smoke while out etc.

I just quit one day and haven't smoked since.. No physical cravings, no urges.. I guess Im just not prone to become physically addicted to nicotine. ""Nicotine gum, patch and will.""Candy Canes helped me.  No joke.  Every single time I wanted to smoke, I'd eat a candy cane.  I don't know if was the mint, the size of the cane, the amount of time it took to actually eat the cane, but it worked.  Good luck!""Not smoking another cigarette.

It sounds mean, but there is no miracle cure. There is no ""One simple trick the cigarette companies don't want you to know about"". 

The answer is no more nicotine. No more hookah, no more ecigs, no patches or gum. All of that crap is going to make you want a cigarette. Weening myself off was actually more difficult than the 4 days it took to stop craving that crap. ""I went cold turkey 6 years ago,  I learnt to love the cravings. I can have a cigarette once in a while,  Had 1 about 5 months ago. ""I smoked for about 15 years.  In July last year I switched to smoking an e cig only when I drank.  Now I've been smoke free since November 3rd last year.  Not long, but a start.""I've smoked for 20+ years. I tried everything. I was successful at quitting while I was pregnant for a few months afterwards.
The ONLY thing that worked for me was selling my house, and moving to a new state to start over. I got rid of my car and downsized. I made sure that no remnants of the smoking life came with me. I smoked on last cigarette before boarding the plane to leave and that was 3 and a half years ago today."read Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking."I know this sounds REALLY stupid, but everyone just before I lit I cigarette u apologized to my heart (out loud).""First I read ""The Easy Way to Quit Smoking."" Although I did not quit right after reading the book, it changed my perspective on smoking and gave me an outlook which helped me quit a few weeks later. As far as actual quitting is concerned, I was struck with a moment of inspiration, threw out my last half of a pack, and allowed myself the courtesy of going a little insane for that first week. It's five months later and I cannot fathom ever returning to such a vice.

Buy the book. It's the first step.

Good luck."Sacking up."my dad quit because of my brother's asthma. even 16 years later, he still wants to smoke."Chantix the expensive crazy prescription medication. Gave me fucked up dreams but it actually worked. I'll be cigarette free 3 years in MayI just stopped. I was smoking menthols and it started to get to the point where I couldn't even laugh without busting out into a coughing fit. I knew it was time to kick that shit. "Looking at each ""relapse"" as an end of your attempt to quit is not helpful. If you haven't smoked in a week and you smoke a cigarette you do not have to start all over again from square one. Go back to quitting and keep on quitting no matter how many times you ""fail"". Cutting back and continuously striving to slip up less and less will eventually get you to the point where you are rarely fiending for the next smoke. 

You really have to want to quit and truly be committed to it as well. It took me losing my father to a heart attack to realize how seriously smoking affects your health and to commit myself to kicking the habit.  I don't want to die at 51 like my pop. 

I smoked a pack a day (plus) for around 6 years.  I quit in the winter of 2007. 

Keep on trying and don't let your failures weigh you down.  A failed attempt is not a failure.  You won't succeed at anything unless you make attempts and yes many of them will fail no matter what your endeavor may be. Giving up makes a failure not trying. "Thinking about how SAGGY and WRINKLY I'd be sooner than I should."Think of it like a diet. If you break down and have a brownie one day it doesn't mean you eat a whole cake the next. Don't buy any cigarettes. If you have one at the pub or bum one from a friend, it's ok! Think of all the cigs you aren't smoking. Eventually you will smoke less and less and it will be easier because the addiction wil wane and the overall habit won't be there. The hardest part is getting your smoking friends to stop offering cigarettes. But once you say no a few times it works itself out. If you're having a ridiculous time try the gum or chewing gum in general. 

I would switch to ecigarettes if I was quitting today. The doucheyness of it would make me quit in a few weeks. ""Once I made sure I wanted to quit (this was after various attempts), I focused myself on cutting back cigarettes, identifying my triggers, and keeping busy. 

I gave myself a deadline (for me it was the new year) and promised myself to quit by then. With the support of an amazing friend who also wanted me to stop, I did it. The new year came, and I've stopped. I do get cravings from time to time, but I don't want to disappoint myself or ruin my health anymore. ""The urge to smoke will pass whether you smoke or not, remember that and its easy.""I quit only when I became disgusted with myself and how weak I had become.
That, and that my wife stopped kissing me."I smoked a pack a day for ten years.  The price of cigs was getting ridiculous and i wanted to live to see forty.  So i quit cold turkey.  I used a straw to satisfy the whole hand to mouth oral fixation.  Then after awhile the need to smoke fades away.  "Age / time. You get a little bit smarter as you get older and start asking yourself if you really want to pay a lot of money each day to feel like shit  every morning.

And electronic cigarettes to dull the need.""where no other method?,Boldly quit harness all levels of consciousness, be confident put your mind to it. Do isometrics or tai chi outside. God gave man free will. Now that's power! ""Sports. Started playing football and realized I couldn't run a hundred yards without running out out breath. Quit the next day.
""Honestly, pure arrogance. Knowing that a very small percentage are able to quit without aid drove me. 11 years without a puff. Just stay confident. ""Date some one who hates it and drives you more crazy than ""not smoking"", that and the nicotine spray helped..""Put a toothpick in your mouth after every trigger like food, drinks, etc. You will soon be addicted to toothpicks.""I was taking Wellbutrin as an anti anxiety medicine. I believe that it is also know as Zyban which is an anti smoking medicine. Well, it worked for me. I noticed that I would no long feel the release of good feelings that came from having a cigarette so I smoked less and less and eventually I smoked so little that when I had a cigarette it would make me sick. So I quit very easily. I've been smoke free for over five years.""Repeatedly telling myself I was a nonsmoker. Fake it till you make it. Being pregnant didn't hurt, and I'd love to say it was for my baby but in reality it was conditioning and self hypnotism."staying away from people who enjoy smoking while socializing.Will power is all it takes. "I was just ready, and I had been for a long time. When my husband asked me to quit, it gave me the motivation I needed. I went on the patch, bought a disposable e-cig for those really desperate moments, and actually said no to the cravings instead of giving in. I didn't stop using the patch until I'd gone through the whole program, and even now I still puff the e-cig every now and then. /r/stopsmoking can really help too. Just keep at it. Don't let excuses cause you to fail. The break thing is an excuse! Don't let it happen!""Cold turkey worked best. Telling myself I could be a smoker again one day, if I wanted, helped psychologically. It was also helpful to know that most people try several times before quitting. Supplanting cravings by treating myself to other things was also helpful."I couldn't afford to continue smoking with a $200/day heroin habit."I made the transition to Vaping. It seemed like a win-win, because I could keep smoking...in more locations...without the nasty smell. What I didn't expect was that after a few weeks of use I actually began to FORGET to smoke. That combined with the fact that my girlfriend was concerned about my health + job prospects that prohibit smokers made it easy to give it up."I was able to keep off smoking with keeping my mind occupied. Every time I quit the moment I started smoking again was because of boredom or break time during work/class."I was told it was the hardest thing you could do.

I set out to prove to myself I had the willpower.""More smoking..continued to smoke until I made myself sick. When I see someone enjoying a cig on the street I remember my smoking days..still miss them, but not worth it.""The electronic mini vaporizer is much more satisfying than an electric cigarette>Just coming off my 5th failed c attempt at quitting.  :( any advice?  My trigger is being at work. ( health care-you only get a break if you step outside and light up.) I have the electronic cigarette, but I end up smoking real ones anyway.  :( HALP!!!

""Zyban(tm)

Worked for me, never even considered the remotest possibility of wanting to smoke again, even when walking through a cloud of smoke in public.

It has bad mental side effects while using it though, considering it's history this is understandable and went into it knowing them quite well.""So far I have quit 3 times. most recently 3 months ago. The first 2 times I quite for a significant other, I quit because they wanted me to quit, and when those relationships ended I hopped right back on the smoker bandwagon smoking is more of a social addiction rather than chemical for me, it gives me an excuse to socialize and find common ground with other people smoking. 

This summer a family friend was diagnosed with lung cancer linked to smoking. He is struggling through treatment and is like my extended family. Every time I picked up a cigarette since hearing that news reminded me that cigarettes are the reason this wonderful person, who has helped me, my parents and many others through rough times, is going to die before his time. ""I got off cigs when they came out with the menthol gum. I always smoked menthol cigs and didn't like the taste of the original non-menthol gum. BUT I didn't take the gum according to the package directions. 

I said to myself, ""Rozina076 you are and always will be addicted to nicotine. However, you can pick to have that nicotine delivered in a way besides smoking. So chew the gum whenever you want, as long and as often as you want. You don't even have to try to get off the gum. Being an addict on gum is better than being an addict with smoke in my lungs."" 

So that's what I did. I was on the gum regularly for about 2 years but since there is not enough in the gum to sustain the addiction, slowly and painlessly I started to do it less. The third year I kept some around, but only really used it when I had one of those potential relapse moments. You know what I mean, a stressful day, or just a wiff of someone else's cig bringing back memories. I still got a box in the freezer but haven't touched the gum in a couple of years.""I quit 5 years ago after smoking for 25 years, up to 2 packs a day. I quit using Nicorette Cinnamon gum. I chewed it for almost a year, now I chew Trident Cinnamon, they're my cigarettes now. I will never go back to smoking, I can't stand the smell anymore. Most important thing...you have to be ready to quit! You can do it!!! You'll feel and smell so much better!!!""You have to really, truly, want to quit.  Know that some day your addiction WILL kill you and coat you more than just money when/if you get cancer, heart problems, circulation problems, and worst of all death. Again, you have to WANT to quit.   ""Smoked for 16 years. Quit last July. When you smoke your last one in a pack, the toughest part is to NOT go buy the next pack. It's easier to quit on an empty pack. And stop carrying a lighter. ""my 3 year old picking up a stick and telling me ""im moking dada"" ='(
stopped doing a lot of dumb shit for my 2 boys""I smoked for 16+ years. Out of nowhere I just got tired and lazy to go outside to have a cigarette. Then I noticed that after lighting one up, I would put it out after a few hits. I decided then and there that I might as well try to quit. What worked for me was that whenever I had cravings, I would dip. No offense to people that dip but I think its fucking disgusting. So eventually I just gave that up too. 

Although e-cigs should be a means to an end, I think its better than actually smoking analog cigarettes. Just get the juice with high nicotine content. "My friend did acid and had a revelation that he should stop. He hasn't smoked in about a year now..I just quit one day.  I went from being an outside guy who could smoke at any time to an office job where I had to take a special effort go outside to smoke.  I guess being too lazy to walk outside has its benefits.Uh.. Self control. "I switched to dipping, and I haven't had a cigarette in a few days. I'm more interested in having my nicotine *and* lung function. ""When I quit it was at a point where I was smoking way too much to begin with. I was studying a lot at the time and smoked close to 3 packs a day. When I quit cold turkey the withdrawals were so intense, puking in the middle of the night and falling asleep on the bathroom floor with cold sweats. That experience made me realize just how addictive they are. And now no matter what - I think back to those painful nights waking up to puke my guts out. It was baaaaad. ""Cold turkey and a promise to myself when I was 17 that I would quit before I turned 30. I'll be 32 in July, and I've been smoke free for 2 years in 2 weeks.""Needing it. Wanting something sometimes isn't enough. I was up to two packs a day for a while (thank the Marine Corps). Once I decided I wanted to become a fire fighter, I knew I had to quit. The stress of carrying a high rise pack up all those stairs was too much for a heavy smoker.
Cold turkey cause I needed it. ""Breaking Bad. Honestly. I know it's a tv show but if Walt can get lung cancer and doesn't smoke, my chances are even greater of getting it than his were. ""Was really sick with the flu / pneumonia for about 2 weeks. Couldn't bring my self to smoke a cigarette during the whole time and when I was finally better, I just never picked it up again.""I quit cold turkey just because I wanted to quit.  Every smoker says, ""yeah, I wanna quit"" or, ""yeah, I should quit.""  But you actually have to want to quit.  That's what it took for me, because I had said all of those things before, too.  Smoking had got to a point where it physically repulsed me (and this was after smoking for 13 years).  So, I quit.  Oh, and health concerns, my kids, yada,yada, yada.""I quit about 5 months ago, and for me, it came down to something very simple: JUST STOP BUYING FUCKING CIGARETTES.

I would try to quit, tell myself ""I'm going to just get a pack, and smoke 3 a day.  That's good enough.""  Then, I have 20 cigarettes in my house/car from the pack I bought, and they're gone in a day.

Really, just stop buying them.""One word, ""Zyban"". Let me explain, I smoked for seven years straight about a pack+ a day after the first couple of years. I couldn't go more than a few hours without smoking. Tried to quit cold turkey, blah, blah. Got super sick of smoking all the time and knew it was time to quit. Took Zyban per the Doctor's instructions and quit smoking PAINLESSLY. Next step was just getting over the actual habit of always putting something in my mouth, lighting up etc.. It felt weird not smoking for a couple of days, but I never had any withdrawals or the urge to smoke. 

I haven't smoked since(2005) and haven't had a craving since then. I can be around, see, and smell cigs. It just doesn't trigger anything. I feel indifferent when I encounter cigs. They do smell completely disgusting now. """"The easy way to quit smoking"" by Allen Carr. 
I really wanted to quit. I read it in two days. I haven't smoked a cigarette, or had nicotine in my body since. It's been over 8 months. I still get urges sometimes but not. As bad as before. I just don't smoke. I thought about vaping, but that seemed more like a crutch than an actual solution. 
You can do it!""A few things, firstly,  Bronchitis. I had bronchitis for 6 months and I still smoked (so dumb). I actually didn't quit until I got better, but the thought of not being able to breathe well again gave me enough anxiety to quit. It's been almost 4 months and I haven't felt so good in years. I smoked for 5 years. I'm already able to jog every morning and lost 10 pounds and to be able to breathe is AMAZING. Another thing, you have to make yourself hate cigs. Look at pictures of cancer patients, read stories, read about how horrible and corrupt the people who make cigarettes are. You DO NOT NEED CIGS. If you need a cigarette, instead go for a drive, have sex, go buy something you want, hang out with friends, make art, ANYTHING to not smoke cigs. Seriously. The first two weeks are hell but once you get through that, you are fucking golden. 

Also, get all that crap out of your head that it's impossible to quit. it's not as hard as people make it out to be but you NEED to stay focused. Make it a fun challenge. I took this opportunity to turn my health around, I also went vegan when I was quitting. I told everyone what I was doing. I will not go back because I will not disappoint myself. You got this! ""Being ready to quit.
""I quit smoking about 12 days ago.  I have been smoking for 15 years or so.  I read this great book called, the Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr.  I read the book, it's like 100 pages and quit.  My father who has been smoking his whole life read the book and he too quit.  

It was the first time either of us had tried to quit smoking and we just did it after reading the book.. What happened was, we both went back to smoking about a year later.  But, what it did do, was make me understand that it is actually possible to quit smoking. 

Though I quit smoking, i really never wanted to quit.  This time I really want to quit because I don't want to be a smoker anymore.  

So, I am just going cold turkey.  It has been two weeks and I have no more nicotine in my system.. That is what most people don't understand about smoking. Nicotine doesn't stay in your system very long.  So, after like 5 or 7 days, you no longer have that crap in your system.. All your urges are less physical and more mental.  

I quit drinking for a month as I know if I have a couple of beers, i am going to smoke a cigarette.  I live in Brooklyn and there is a bodega selling butts, literally 50 feet from my house.  

So, I am hoping after a month of no smoking, i will be able to throw a few back without running to the store.  

I feel great.  The first two weeks kind of sucked and now, almost 13 days in, my cravings are few and far between.. even the smell is making my a little grossed out.. 

though, i must admit, when i parked my car today, there was like 8 cigarettes on the street that were smoked and my first though was, wow, i could smoke one of those.. but, that passed in seconds.  

Anyway, good luck.. i highly suggest you read the book, the easy way to quit smoking.. it puts it in perspective.. 

"Chantix. Chantix.Cold turkey. "I changed some parts of my daily routine.  I found that certain activities through out the day used to trigger my need for a cigarette.

See, she's a chain smoker and I saw this shell of a person laying there looking so frail and she's 55.  The dr told her that smoking was a direct correlation.

She lived, and I decided that smoking was one health thing I could control and that for the sake of my loved ones I wanted to quit.

And I did, now the thought makes me sick.

"moving to Singapore and to a completely non-smoking campus worked for me. Vaping.  Only thing that worked for both me and my wife.  Smoke free one year this February. i got pregnant."Chantix the first time, lasted 6 months. The final time cold turkey and will power. They say after 3 days the addiction to nicotine has passed, after that it's just repetitive habit and trying to avoid needing one after eating or during drinking. Just put it this way, you want to live as long as possible? Better quit then, or think about an agonizing death you could face. ""Moving.

The US is generally much less of a smoking culture than Europe and when none of your friends smoke and you don't see people doing it frequently, the mental triggers tend to go away.""For the people who vape, yes it is a much better alternative but if you are vaping the same amount of nicotine in a pack of cigs it's not doing much.  I gradually worked my way down to zero I wouldn't recommend vaping at the same level for it is just as addicting.""Hepatitis A. Definitely recommend it for weight loss, too. ""Probably not that helpful but I haven't smoked in 5 years (nearly 6) and I just decided to stop one day. I think it was easier for me because I was only smoking about 5 cigarettes a day and I always hid my smoking, I hates the way cigarettes smelled and was actually quote ashamed that I did it.
Good on you for trying to quit, I know from family and friends that it's VERY hard so congrats on having the desire to go through it. ""I tried lozenges many times and it never stuck. After 16 years of smoking, I quit by sheer will. Haven't smoked in a year and one month. I just decided not to and stuck with it. ""Speaking for my dad, who quit smoking after being half/pack per day for 15 odd years. Originally it was to save money (in Australia cigarettes get taxed MEGA high, $18 USD/pack)
But that didn't really provide enough impetus. Plus he was young (ish), mid-late 30s, so it wasn't the whole health debacle stage. 

What worked for him was simply slow and steady moderation. 
Took him a while (few years between half/pack and the current stage of one every 6-12 mths), but first he reduced consumption to one or two a day, then to once a week, then to social occassions and so forth.

It has definitely worked, because even now that we're better off money wise, he hasn't gone back to it. A further 10 years later. 

The last time I personally saw him smoke was about 3/4 years ago.

So advice. Don't turkey it up. Don't rely on patches.
 
Rely on reducing consumption little by little every day, and avoiding chain smoking when you go out. 
The latter should be easier now that most places make you go well out of your way to smoke at venue. ""I'm not the smoker but my dad was.

For my 10th birthday, my parents kept asking me what my birthday wish was. I said if I told them, it wouldn't come true. They kept asking...so I finally said, I wish my dad would stop smoking.

And he quit, cold turkey just like that. Best birthday wish ever. ""My mom did the same thing for me. Took till I was 30. I'm a hygienist and always tell patients the best way to quit is to gift it to someone. Wrap it up and give it to someone who will be so appreciative of the gift, that it will help hold you accountable. I've had 6 patients quit!!!"It all came down to the fact that there were better things I could've spent my money on.Three weeks in the hospital with severe pneumonia. I stopped so those fucking dog prison guards lost the advantage of having another privilege they could have taken off me. It is so bad having your tobacco taken off you when being transferred or for what ever reason a screw might want to come up with for you to lose it for a week or a month at a time and scrounging or bludging a smoke until you got a buyup or got your smokes back. "I've been clean for 14 months after smoking for 10 years.

When I finally quit, I knew without a doubt it would be for good. The year before I quit I had started running to try to get over the ex. I fell in love with running so I trained for a Half marathon. I probably racked up1,000 miles while smoking. That whole time, I was just running and sort of mulling my life over in head trying to figure out how everything worked out the way it did.

After the half marathon I started thinking about doing a full marathon. It was at that point that I knew if I was going to run a marathon, I had to quit.


I spent a few weeks psyching myself up about quitting and on Monday, December 7 I quit.

I knew I was going to be an asshole fora few weeks so I did nothing but work, eat, drink booze, run, play video games, and contemplate (read crave) my addictions. I didn't talk to friends or family. The only contact I had was with /r/stopsmoking and my boss. The goal was to not have any stress.

I ate apples when I had a craving and learned to see what was triggering my cravings.

Quitting is an amazing opportunity to learn about yourself. If you find yourself craving a cigarette, realize your craving, breath, then take a step back and think about what is causing you to want it. Before long you will be thinking about yourself as opposed to a cigarette.

After a few weeks I started going out with friends, found a girlfriend, then ran marathon! It was the only time I ever cried because I was so proud of myself.

Good luck quitting, you can do it. Find what's worth quitting over and decide once and for all to quit. ""You probably won't see this, but camping. When my buddy quit cold turkey, he took me and a few other friends that wouldn't annoy the shit out of him and we went out to the woods for a couple weeks. Brought food, fishing gear, booze, weed, water guns, fireworks, music, anything at all. Distractions are key. If you're in a position to get away from it all for a bit, it can really help. And have a shit ton of things to take your mind off the urge. Although, if you're out in the middle of the woods with no tobacco anywhere for a good 25 miles in every direction, you're off to a good start ""I started rolling my own. That immediately cut down on my smoking from about a pack a day to 10 or so a day. Then I got myself down to five or so a day and moved. I told myself I would never smoke in my new apartment and I didn't. For a while, I would still bum smokes off people in bars, but then the bars all went non-smoking and that was it. Ultimately, though, you just have to convince yourself that smoking is NOT something that you do. ""I always considered smoking ""fresh air events"".  I quit because I liked staying inside more.""My wife yelling at me constantly. Cold turkey, son.""I LOVED smoking, I just want to really really make that clear before I tell you how I quit cold turkey. All it took was sitting outside with my then boyfriend, now husband & realizing he had never smoked anything & I was killing him because he sat outside next to me every time I would smoke... I smoked for 10 years & we we're only dating 7 months when I quit, almost 6 years or so later &  I'm thrilled. Good luck!!! ""Start rolling your own cigarettes, and buy tobacco that you don't like. Make smoking as miserable as possible""I got an ecig & a job where I had scheduled breaks. My thing was a brand new ecig. I had tried the same thing last year but with an old one (3 years old), the new one worked the best."Eating like a MF. "Actually wanting to do it. If you want to do something, you do it. You're not going to quit unless you just stop doing it. Its your hand, arm, wallet etc. Just knock it off. Source: I was a smoker for over 10 years at a pack to a pack and a half a day.""I got pregnant. Nothing motivated me like thinking about growing a new little life using nicotine, tar, and about a million other toxic substances.""The only thing that will ever get you to stop is actually wanting to.  You clearly don't want to break the habit, so you don't.  You know you should, and you're probably bowing to social pressure by trying to quit, but you don't really want to quit, so you don't.  It's that simple.""""You have asthma, you're gonna die."""Vaping. Quit without issue after 7 years of smoking."Chantix. I didn't do the full cycle of it because it was making my dreams and reality blur a little, but once I was about a month and a half without a smoke, I quit the medicine, and haven't even thought about touching another one. "Chantix worked like a champ. I have no will power and you don't need it with chantix. Just Mae sure you take the full three or four month prescription. I've quit twice with it but screw up thinking I've quit when really it's the pills. So I quit taking the pills and fall back off the wagon. I'm going to do it again. They really work and no I didn't have suicidal dreams. E cigs are great too. Plus you can smoke me at your desk at work. That's kinda cool. "I just quit, I said WTF am I doing this for its silly and just stopped, never looked back... Just think about what you are doing to your body, and think about why you are doing it... are you really getting anything out of it besides that 15 min break. 

If the only way you can get a break is to smoke then say you're going outside for a smoke, and instead of smoking just do a lap around your building, or something that will keep your mind of the smoking.  If you don't want to lie just say your going outside, or talk to your supervisor and explain what you are doing... just my advise. ""I was on vacation and got strep throat. My insurance at the time was horrible, so I tried curing it with ibuprofen and Tylenol. Needless to say, I was not smoking during the strep. By the time it cleared up, the urge to smoke had passed. Its not the most pleasant way to do it, but it was effective.""Honestly, just like both my sets of grandparents, I just stopped when I wanted to. I honestly don't believe most people have an ability to deal with minor discomfort long enough to get over it and I think cigarette addiction is an exaggeration. ""Tied it to identity... ""oh man, cigarettes smell great and I sure want one. but I cannot, because I AM NOT A SMOKER"""". ""Remember this: there is no such thing as ""quitting smoking.""  You either smoke or you don't. To say you are quitting is giving yourself permission to smoke. So you can have one more because you're still quitting. You haven't quit quite yet so it's ok to have another. 
It's an endless cycle and self defeating. You are either a smoker or you're not.  There's no in between. 
This piece of advice made a huge difference for me and helped immensely. I quit cold turkey 8 years ago. I pass this along every chance I get. ""First I quit drinking. Then I started running. Running is not particularly easy when you've been smoking, but it helps with cravings.

For a week or two, I allowed myself to indulge in whatever I wanted that wouldn't trigger me to smoke - so basically, no booze. Chocolate, coffee, pornography - treat yourself to everything that won't make you want to smoke.

I used the patch for a few days, but it was messing with my sleep. A doctor told me to take the patch off at night. I woke up the next day and didn't feel like I needed it. I read that it takes 30 minutes between putting on the patch and starting to feel relief and I figured I could muscle through 30 minutes as necessary. I never put the patch back on.

It also helped that one day I just got really pissed off that I couldn't quit. I got mad at cigarettes. Other people I've talked to said this attitude helped them. Spite is a powerful thing.""Followup comment: I once heard a stand up comic (on Last Comic Standing, maybe) who said that drinking and smoking is like shitting and pissing. You can have a smoke without drinking and you can take a piss without shitting, but god help you if you try to shit without pissing.""A really bad case of the flu...
 I was smoking a pack a day or more for many years, but then March of last year I caught the worst case of the flu I've ever had. It got to where I could barely smoke an entire cigarette throughout the day so I quit smoking midway through. Then after I got over the flu it had already been 2-3 days since I had smoked a cigarette so I figured it'd be stupid to start back... Haven't had one since except the few tokes I've taken here or there.

Although, this isn't much of a method for quitting as much as lucky circumstances and that I was already ready to quit anyway.""Electronic cigarette and winter. For the past four years I worked in a building over a parking garage so smoking meant being cold but not out in the weather. This summer I moved to a new office with a sorry lonely picnic table at the end of a parking lot across from nothing but cornfields. The first big snow was in November, and I've been vaping ever since. Inside. ""Coming to the conclusion that cigarettes on the north side of Chicago cost $13.50 a pack.

""Cold turkey. It's shitty, but if you can muster the mental discipline and will power, it's pretty awesome!""When I quit I bought my last packet of cigs and didnt open them.
I had them with me the whole time, but knew that I wanted to quit.

The reason is that previously, I would get until like 11pm, and get really desparate, then walk to the shop to get cigs. I think the issue of not having them bothered me more than the cigs themselves. I had the packet, I COULD have one, but I didnt want one.

Good luck buddy"Cancer"Electronic Cigarettes helped.

i went back and forth for about a year, finally went to electronic for about 6 months (was mixing my own juice), upped the nicotine and started having heart problems (i was 24) and was already waking up with a really dry mouth/nose/throat.

all in all i think it was the bpm thing, if you measure time in heart beats most animals live the same amount of time...nicotine increases your heart rate.


TLDR; Electronic cigarettes helped me separate nicotine from cigarettes and realize it was shortening my life. ""I started with Snus instead, like real vikings. Never makes you wanna have another cig again""I started running and wanted a better time, as well as I started to look at it as a bill over a month and realized how much I was spending. After three days on the patch and one insane dream I was completely done.""Cigars honestly.  I realized I really enjoyed cigars and hated smoking cigs.  I had already decided that I was going to quit smoking cigs so I bought a humidor, had my last cig in a ritualistic manner (wrote down reasons why smoking was keeping me down and burned them with the light cig) and stopped.  I relapsed a couple times with dip, but when my cigars came in I never touched anything else.  Now I have a cigar maybe once a month (more if there is a special occasion) and that's it.  I have gone 2 full months before without any nicotine and didn't feel any issues so I feel I am no longer a slave.  

It may not be what you're looking for, but it is what worked for me.  And, I've still saved money so that's always a plus.""Champix worked for me (Chantix in the US I believe).

I say 'worked' in that it was entirely successful in helping me quit, but it fucked me up completely in other areas. I told my story in another thread some months back [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1r97tw/fda_antismoking_drug_chantix_linked_to_more_than/cdl2igo?context=3).

It's been 2 years 2 months now and no desire to smoke, at all. 

In fairness my life back then was crap in a lot of other ways, which may have contributed, but if you do decide to give Cha[mp|nt]ix a go, be in a good place emotionally, watch your moods like a hawk, consult your doctor often, and cease taking it if you feel anything weird, and it's a good idea to lay off the booze as well.""Getting really Fucking sick. Getting better now, but I kept my quit. Never again, 110 days strong. 70 days sober. "ITT: A bunch of fucking quitters."My grandfather smoked for 30 years, 1 pack or more a day. We went to Vegas and got walking pneumonia. He was so sick he couldn't smoke. He hasn't smoked since then. ""I just quit. Stopped making excuses and rationalizing my habit and quit. If you ACTUALLY want to quit badly enough, then you will.""Zoloft and moving away from the town where I smoked, and all the people I used to smoke with. ""Every time you pick up a cigarette, puncture yourself with a needle. For me, it only took me a couple of days to quit smoking altogether.""its fukin hard say that for one if you wanna quit you have to HATE it and i mean hate evry thing about it how u feel after one, the head aches, pissing all the time then evry time u get a craveing and u will u can use the hate u have for thoes fukers to never go back""The best way... Every time you crave a cigarette go for a run... Run until you are fucking exhausted regardless what you are wearing, I once went for a run in dress pants and dress shoes and came back to work looking like I just got pushed into a pool. The sheer fact that you destroy yourself running will keep you from wanting a cigarette, the running part after you quit will make your lungs hurt in a way that if you smoke you'll cough your brains out but at the same Tim they'll intake more oxygen than ever before and you'll feel great... It's been 2 years, the only time I smoke is when I get really drunk and even after one cigarette I feel like dick balls for several days... Start running and get your ass into shape "I met a wonderful Woman who said she wouldn't date a smoker."It took me about 7 or 8 serious attempts, but for the final one, my wife and I made it our new years resolution. We had a 2 yr old son. That gave us more reason. My method was to just tell myself ""another cigarette will not touch my lips"". I also got into eating super healthy and exercising. It's a mental thing - think healthy thoughts.  I also got very cranky with people for a few months. I was told more than once to go back to smoking. It's been 24 yrs."ITT: E-Cigs and Cold TurkeyOnly if you sort by top.

We've been married for 9 years and it's been 8 years since my last smoke."Both my so's father and I used Wellbutrin (Bupropion Hcl). Took about 2 weeks. My SO took it as an anti-depressant (a much higher dose than the stop smoking dose) and it do nothing for him so your results may vary."I weened myself off. I realized after a ski trip I could hardly breathe above 7000 feet, so I went from 2 packs a day to 2 cigs a day in about 4 months. At the end, just before stopping completely, I would light up and take only a few drags and save the stump for later.""What many people preach on this sub is that you have to WANT to quit. You can't enter into quitting smoking thinking it as ""I really like smoking but..."" because when you do that first time you're drinking with your buddies you'll think that just one smoke won't hurt. But it does. It will drag you right back into your old habits or worse.

When I quit last August, it was because I was tired of smelling horribly, I wanted to be as healthy as possible, wanted to save money, didn't want any more burn holes in the carpet of my truck... There are so many reasons to quit smoking.

At 21-22 I decided that my 25th birthday present to myself was to quit smoking forever. One day last summer, I thought to myself, ""fuck it, your deadline to quit is in 6 months. Finish this pack, quit for good, and save yourself the hassle."" 

Just use your strength as a human being and resist picking up that smoke AT ALL COSTS. There are days even 500+ days later where I smell someone smoking an American Spirit and I start trembling because I want one SO BAD. However, I simply choose not to give in and try to bum a smoke off someone, and literally 30 seconds later the feeling is gone and I'm shaking my head and laughing about how silly smoking is, how annoying it is to have a ""cough"" year round, and how awesome it is staring at the clouds.

Many of us are lucky enough to live in a safe and possibly also beautiful part of the world. Take a deep breath, and enjoy it. I feel pity for those who need tobacco to ""enjoy"" their life."My mom smoked for years and quit with hypnosis and swears by it. never smoked again after it.Eating a shitload of eggplant."I wanted to be a good rolemodel for my sisters, cigarettes were expensive, and I wanted to fully embrace my healthy lifestyle.

""I got 3 weeks in a Jail that didnt allow smoking! It was a new rule and loads of convicts were blowing up about it. The first week was hell, then I started to feel better. Now I drink loads more though.""I quit the same day I found out I was pregnant with my first child. But then again it was easy for me because I didn't smoke for long and was mostly a social smoker. My husband had quit for 6 years prior to meeting me. He started smoking again a while later and quit again when our daughter turned 2. The first time was on Nicorette patches, he attempted it again the second time, however the patches kept coming off and didn't work as well. He ended up quiting on Chantix the second time. I know some people say it gives you nightmares, but he described it as vivid dreams. If you normally have nightmares Chantix would make it that much worse.  His handle is u/drackon654, if you wish to have him explain it better. You will find him in the warhammer40k section. ""I quit when I broke up with my girlfriend.  Life changes and difficult times can help break the habitual part of smoking, the addictive component is a little tricky. ""Well, I smoke now, because I relapsed after having quit for 4 whole years.  But I was once a quitter, and I will be a quitter again.  Here is how I did it:  

I quit cold turkey, with a twist.  I figured if I could make it a week without smoking, then I could make it forever...and I was right (at least until I thought I could handle a cigar, big mistake.) 

I packed a backpack and went on a 12 night backpacking trip to Isle Royale National Park.  There is nowhere to buy cigarettes on the island.  Other than a couple of ranger stations, it is entirely wilderness.  

The challenge of the trip, the exercise, and solitude were great a great help too.  I went solo.

Note: I extensively researched my gear before purchasing any of it, and I trained for the trip, which helped make it a success.  ""Set a date, find a smoking cessation program online that will send you regular emails with words of encouragement, reasons why it's good that you're quitting, etc... remind yourself of the gradual benefits.

For me though, the best and easiest way was to quit after being sick and unable to smoke, and just continuing with it. And also telling everyone at work and in my family and non-smoking friends that I quit so I'd disappoint them if I started again. It worked for me.""I was engaged. My wife (then fiance) said she loved me very much, but didn't want to marry a smoker, but she would if I couldn't quit. She didn't guilt me. She didn't judge me. She simply said she had tolerated my smoking our entire dating life, and that she wanted me to stop before we married. I quit. I miss it. But, it worked. No ultimatums. Just a simple request is all it took.""I started smoking in my early 20's. Luckily, I was living in North Carolina, and at that time it was cheaper in NC to smoke than breathe."My parents used Chantix. "realising that only the first cigg of the day gave me that rush and calmness made me realise how much time money and health is wasted because of it. 

Also, our bodies never needed it, our minds never craved nicotine before this. I enjoyed the rough inhalation and sensation of taking a drag. Realised deep breathing/meditation was the equivalent for me. "I had only been smoking about 5-6 years. In the end I stopped cold turkey. I had read Alan Carr's book it worked for about 2 months then started smoking again for a year. I then re read the book taking time for it to fully sink in and it made complete sense. I have been a non smoker for two years and won't smoke again. If anything I implore you to read it you've got nothing to loose and all to gain.Switching to an e-cigarette.I bought a couple loosies in the mornings and only allowed myselves those for the day. then I stopped buying loosies.smoke weed insteadHeart attack at age 42. 18.5 years ago.I started running a lot.

I'm using mine now. 7 months without smoking. "I have about 8 attempts under my belt of varying lengths from 1-2 months to 9 months before I finally beat them (3.5 years now).

I used patches. When I drank I kept nicotine gum with me to chew when the cravings got worse with drinking.
I also quit the exact same day I started a new job. 
I was new and didnt know anyone, hence I didnt know the smokers.
Also I was desperate to make a great first impression. Smelling like cigarettes and going out for breaks every hour are not a good look in a new job.""Just imagine how rich you're making some rich white dude every time you buy a pack. Better yet, just imagine that cigarette is the tiny, skinny white dicks of super rich tobacco magnates. And you're sucking his dick. And paying him for the privilege. And just to fuck with you, he has stinky nasty poison splooge, and he makes you swallow some of it so it gives you cancer, and then he sprays some of it all over your face and hair and clothes and fingers. And you stink like rich white fatcat cum, and everyone around you can smell it, and knows that you just got done sucking that guy's nasty dickarette.

Every time you feel tempted to light up, just remind yourself that you're a sucker, and that you're throwing your money and health away to companies whose legacy is lies, slavery, poison, and murder.

""Champix. Been quit for 6 months now. Have quit before for over 12 months, both times Champix. ""It sounds cliche but it worked for me and I smoked for 8 years. You really have to genuinely want it. That's the best motivation, that and think of your loved ones, what if they lost you?""Try changing habits. The biggest problem for me was to be falling back to the standar routines that i connected with smoking ad nearly my hole life was somehow. I was a pretty severe smoker. I used several of the changes that happen in live to leave smoking behind. Also my gf said she didnt want to kiss me anymore when i freshly came back from smoking. Also being motivated to go to your sportive limit by a friend (eg running) and really hearing your lungs throw the towel did a big part to convince me. (And feeling your body struggeling on the waste in your system) There is no chemical addiction to smoking, its plain habitual. Basically you could say you get used to smoking, nothing more. Its 'only' your psyche. 
I quit when i went backpacking, that was ideal because i didnt know myself as a smoker on the other side of the planet. In totally new habits and situations it was pretty easy to give it up. Maybe 1-2 tough weeks, but NZ was to overwhelming anyways to keep thinking about smoking. That was on the 14th of november 2011 so i'd say things are going pretty good. I never touched a cigarette again and never wanted to either. Though i was heavily addicted back in the days. Also the aspect of saving a lot of money i could put to a good use. Quitting smoking pays 2 cinematickets for me and my gf every month.

Tl:dr : stick smoking to the constant changing circumstances (positive as negative) in your life and leave it behind with them. Save the bucks as well. Distract and Reward yourself wisely.

Good luck ;)"My girlfriend. You can do it if you want to.I used the gum Nicorette it doesn't taste as bad as some make it out. I had great support and will power. Every day without the better it got. I still did things like crack the window whenever I got into the car for about the first year or so. Been about 5 years now and I will admit I have had a few slip ups along the way the wasted cig or the pack before a night of drinking but its been about full 2 years since I have done that."Nicorette helped a lot, but my kids more than anything. Every day, for at least a year without fail, they would tell me how proud they were of me not smoking. They never badgered me when I did smoke, but the happiness in their voices when I stopped had a big impact on me. I hope you have someone who loves you that can do that for you."Nicotine gum worked for me - I stopped and used the gum to stave off the cravings for a week or two and then switched to regular gum for a week. It sucks for about a week and then it gets better."Easy. 

Get married to a non smoker and have kids.""I'm a little late to the party, but I'll throw in my two cents.  I quit smoking July 5th, 2005.  To me there's a bunch of things that helped me quit successfully.

1.  I was on vacation staying at a friend's place.  There was no smoking allowed in the house, and I had no pattern of smoking there.  The first couple of weeks is by far the hardest, and being in a place where your pattern is broken helps.

2.  For the first couple of days, I never decided I was quitting, I just kept putting off buying smokes.  I had just discovered WoW, so that helped a little bit, ""I'll get a pack after this instance, I'll get a pack in the morning"", etc.  Anyone who played WoW in the early years knows that ""after this instance"", and ""in the morning"" meant pretty much the same thing a lot of the time.

3.  Once I decided to quit, I didn't tell anyone.  Maybe it's just me, but friends tend to go into two different camps.  Overly supportive friends adding pressure, and jerks that do everything they can to make it harder to quit.  People discovered in time that I had quit, but it bought me a few weeks of going it alone at least.

For reference, I was a pack a day smoker who had been smoking for almost 20 years.  It's tough for the first few weeks, but you'll get through it.  ""Cold turkey plus public accountability, and a sizable bet.""Isolate yourself for a while, away from your triggers, and quit cold turkey.""RN here. I tried damn near everything to quit smoking at multiple times over the years, with varying degrees of success. Chantix, Wellbutrin, cold turkey, they all have their pros and cons. The final straw for me was watching some of my patients with COPD literally focus every waking thought on taking that next breath. I had one patient tell me that she was absolutely grateful if she was able to have that satisfying feeling of being able to catch her breath just a couple of times a day. Scared the living crap out of me. That was a little over a year ago & I haven't touched a cigarette since.
""The biggest thing for me was never giving up.  I've dealt with a lot of addictive cycles in my life and it's my belief that relapses almost certainly will happen and what constitutes successful or unsuccessful quitting behavior depends on: how you look at your relapses, what you learn from them, and how you can modify your behavior to be more successful later on.

I've quit smoking cigarettes for periods of time ranging from 2 years at the longest to less than a day.  The number of times I've attempted in some fashion to quit is almost innumerable.  But within that cycle of seeming failure is that each time I fell there was something to be learned about myself and what I need to do to quit successfully.  For instance, the times I find it most difficult to stave of the severe cravings are: in the morning with my coffee, after meals, and when stressed out (this last category is HUGE and solely responsible for ALL my relapses after long periods of not smoking). 

So what did I learn from the relapses?  Mainly that being mindful of when and how I will experience cravings is necessary to quit.  Being mindful is learned mostly by experience.  You've quit 5 times now. I would encourage you to analyze how the last relapse happened, and what you can do to cope with that circumstance better in the future.  For instance, a big trigger for me was after eating, so I started carrying around a cinnamon stick that I used to pull air through to simulate smoking.  Yeah I looked silly, but moments later and the craving subsides.  Remember most cravings only last for two minutes.  If you can hold out you'll be fine.

I could go on a lot longer here as I have a lot of experience with this subject.  More than I'd like to admit. Unfortunately there isn't a magic way to quit that always works, you just have to keep trying.  Keep searching to find what helps YOU.  Here's a list of what I did that helped in some way or another.  Use what helps and discard the rest.  

1. Write a list of reasons why you want to quit
2. Keep a straw or cinnamon stick to pull air through
3. Chew gum
4. Separate yourself from stressful situations and breathe
5. Nicotine gum/patch
6. Forgive yourself for faltering and once you're ready try again

Good luck, don't give up!"My grandmother died from lung cancer then two years my father passed from a smoking related illness. After we buried my dad I quit cold turkey the next day. I smoked for 10 years and I could never be more happy that I quit!"I smoked for 8 years. Chewed the gum and worked great. I bought the 150 gum package and halfway through I just sick of them. One night drinking I ended throwing up after having one piece of gum and the next morning I didnt want to touch them. Relasped in Chicago after smoking cigars, went back to gum shortly thereafter and did it all over again, havnt smoked since. Theirs always better things to smoke, tobacco isnt one of them, too addicting. ""Cold turkey. It wasn't easy, but I started going to the gym the same day and threw myself into my projects (I was in my last year of university) and I took it one craving at a time. I told me it wasn't going to kill me to not smoke a cigarette (in fact, the exact opposite), and I focused on how shitty I felt trying to work out after smoking for so long and how much better I would feel the longer I went without smoking. 

I had cravings for a cigarette for a long while after I quit. Especially after a big meal. But after I hadn't been smoking for a while my sense of taste and sense of smell came back and I *couldn't stand* the smell of cigarettes and couldn't believe how much better I could taste things. 

Sometimes I still smoke in my dreams. It's been six years. It's so strange to me now. I don't miss it. I realize how much amazingly better my life is now that I've quit. I can run and work out and smell and taste things. My clothes and skin don't smell bad. I don't have to find excuses to sneak away around people who I didn't want to know I smoked. And the best part is that there's a very good chance I will never get lung cancer. So I've got that going for me. ""Decided to have a baby, made the choice easy. My son is 5 months old and I haven't had a smoke since Sept 2012."Shame and pressure from my fiance. It worked I guess."I found what really worked was STOP PUTTING THEM IN YOUR MOUTH!

A few years later I was cleaning up and found them up the back of the drawer, completely forgotten. I threw them out. Haven't had a smoke in almost a decade now."Changing my surroundings."I went the electronic cigarette path. Not the cheap variable voltage ones, but got a mechanical mod and a drip tank atomizer. Hits great an huge clouds. ""It's easy to give in to that urge and get rid of the craving. The trick I found was to never give in to it, and to remind myself that the discomfort was temporary. That became my mantra: It's just temporary! When the mood swings hit, I'd yell that at myself. I'll be 12 years cigarette-free in March, from a 20 year habit that had grown to 30 cigarettes a day by the time I quit. What made me want to quit was the rise of prices. I could not justify spending $21 every other day for cigarettes. Good luck to you!""I had to have major surgery on my back and the surgeon instructed me to stop a month or so beforehand to help the huge scars heal properly. I had a lot of trouble quitting, but by the time I was released from the hospital a week later I lost all urges to smoke. And I've remained smoke-free ever since. ""Patch. I was supposed to be on it for 7 weeks. After 2 weeks I had this sudden surge of thought, ""I can do this!"". Quit the patch the next day. Haven't smoked since. That was 23 years ago. 
""This is a pretty bad way to quit, but I did a bunch of cocaine one night and smoked about 2 packs in roughly 5 hours (I was a 1/4-1/2 pack guy at the time). I woke up the next day feeling like hell in more ways than one, didn't have a taste for a cigarette for about 4 or 5 days and by that time I knew the nicotine was out of my system and said fuck it to buying a new pack."Champix. Get a prescription. Follow the directions. Better living with chemistry."Reading this helped a lot:

Also, not talking about quitting. That always just brought more focus on being a smoker.""I'm pretty damn late on this but I smoked for 15 year and one day my body was definitely feeling the affects of it. I decided it was time. I locked myself in my room that night and began to read all the normal withdrawal symptoms and started to cry.   I was crying because I was afraid of what was going to happen and elated knowing this was really the end. I didn't leave my house, let alone my room for 4 days. I played drums and did a lot of research on the topic. Three years later and I haven't smoked since. ""This is going to get lost I bet, so I will make it short. This has worked for everyone that I have relayed this to and who gives it a serious go.

First of all, one must re-frame the problem, most people go into it thinking that tobacco is SO difficult to give up, that it is some insurmountable problem, etc. The first thing I and others have done, is to re-frame it and think that this is an extremely minor issue, something that can be easily conquered. Second one must reflect on the fact that after three days or so, there is no more physical pull towards it, it is purely mental at that point. This is where basic meditation helps a lot, simply watch the thoughts arise and fall, instead of automatically identifying with them, observe that they are temporary and have no real power over you.

There could be some elaboration but I think you get the gist of it. One of my friends, who really is the opposite of an intellectual (he a good guy but seriously has a very low IQ) was able to do this, and said specifically the biggest thing is re-framing it into a proportionally small issue, instead of blowing it out of proportion and effectively giving tobacco way more power than it actually has. I bring him up to demonstrate that one doesn't have to have supercognitive abilities to apply this correctly, or be some-type of serious yogi. 

Normal people are tricking themselves into thinking they have no power or discipline in the face of this, probably because of these stop-smoking services that are sold and likely working en masse, as it creates a perception that this is something far more difficult than it is, or those that sell doses of nicotine, keeping up the physical cravings. It is just thoughts holding you back, you are not your thoughts or he sum total of them.""Several months of coughing up gobs of phlegm each morning. Out of breath frequently and then quit. A few years later I had a massive heart attack, the most painful experience I have ever had. Imagine laying on your back while a two hundred pound weight is placed on your chest. that's how it felt. then followed the fear that ""I'm gonna die very soon."" 

I fought to breathe. It was SO very hard to breathe. I was sweating profusely. Dripping with sweat. 911 was called and the EMT was luckily only a few houses away visiting his Mom. He had Nitroglycerin. A State Trooper showed showed up moments later with an oxygen bottle. then the First Aid Squad got the five minutes later and took me to the hospital.  I got a stent put in my heart. then a few months later an ICD (implantable cardioversion defibrillator) put in my chest.

Either live for a while in denial and keep smoking, or plan on dying a painful death from cancer or heart attack.

I'm VERY lucky. My heart attack (100% occlusion of the LAD artery) is called the widow maker. 89% death rate is what my doctors told me.

I'm so anti-smoking now I'd be pleased to punch your lights out if it would help you quit. Please please quit.""Late - but don't care.....I smoked for over 20 years & I really never tried to quit since I didn't want to quit & fail. The first thing that happened is I moved & stopped smoking inside my apt. Then I slowly started to whittle down the # of cigarettes I smoked per day until I was down to around 3 (on the walk to work, at lunch, and after work - then I was going on vacation. I smoked my last cigarette at the airport & now its been over 4 years since I quit. I've had a few cravings, but I'd gotten into endurance sports which helps me avoid having ""just one"" plus a pack is like $12 here in NYC & that just INSANE!!!
""It took me a bunch of times, but what helped me was moving out of a house of smokers and going on a month long trip with a bunch of friends where no one smoked. Cigs were extremely expensive where I was and I never bought a pack and only bummed a handful when we were out at bars. When I got back I realized I had basically not smoked in a month and kept it going. ""High stress environments would do that to you. I know because I worked Customer Service. My recommendation is to try and just keep it at work, and when you're home or else where, don't smoke.  The less you do it, the more you're inclined to quit with time. 

Personally, I quit cold turkey and instead started this habit of chewing sugar-free gum. I'm not sure if it's healthy, but it's got to be healthier than those cancer sticks.  Can't say the urge is gone and I don't relapse sometimes, but the thing is to keep trying.""I just picked a day, about 3 months in the future, and said, ""This is the last day I'm going to be smoking cigarettes.""  That day was September 30, 2003.  It helped that I had 3 months to kind of get myself used to it.  At that time, patches were still a relatively new tech, and I bought a pack of them about a week before the big day.

Day 1, no cigarettes:  Not too bad, actually. I put a patch on my chest that morning, and I bought a 1-lb bag of the individually wrapped pieces of bubble gum.  I chewed a few pieces of gum, mostly just finding things to do instead of smoke.  

Day 2, no cigarettes:  Patch that morning was causing significant skin irritation, but I was still ok.  Chewed a lot of gum that day.

Day 3, no cigarettes:  Fucking nightmare.  The patch burned and itched so bad I couldn't stand it.  I'm pretty sure I chewed a pound of bubble gum that day, and did not sleep a wink that night.  That third day was the worst one.

Day 4:  about 90% of the misery of Day 3.  Still holding the line, though.  The inside of my mouth was raw from all the bubble gum.

Days 5-30:  Each day was about 90% as shitty as the day before.  Less bubble gum, a little more sleep, a little more mood stability, a little less feeling-like-ass.

Here I am over 10 years later, having smoked exactly 3 cigarettes in that time.  All 3 were when I was shit-hammered drunk, and all 3 were terrible and a bad idea.  None of the three made me want to go back to smoking.

TL;DR  I quit smoking by force of will and bubble gum.  You can do it.  It will suck, but you can do it.""Self-identifying as a non-smoker. That's basically the main paradigm shift that helped me stop. And, ideally not being around other smokers on the regular.""Mint toothpicks, you must substitute the bad habit with something else that keeps your mouth or fingers busy.

Do not use nicotine replacements, they are a scheme to keep you addicted. Cold turkey is the only way to results, everything else is nicotine lifeline.

Keep yourself exposed to cigarettes because every second of being exposed to it while not smoking is you reinforcing yourself against your addiction and strenghtening your determination. If you were a smoker taking smoke breaks at work, keep taking them with your colleagues, they will end up working towards your resilience.

Soldier on, its all about a firm and final decision to be done with cigs.

The first 3 weeks are the hardest.
3 months you're done thinking about it.

good luck.
""The weirdest thing did it for me... I caught one of the worst chest colds in my entire life. In the weeks following, the thought of a cigarette made me cringe, since I was already struggling with chest and nasal congestion. After I recovered, I never really craved one again. I guess I somehow associated smoking with my chest cold and never looked back.""23 year smoker, quit 8 years ago.
My wife's support was the biggest contributor, she was awesome.""I started to use dip for awhile and transitioned from smokes to dip. I slowly transitioned off the dip to the point where the cravings were mild, but at this point your simply craving nicotine not the act of smoking. Then I just quit the dip. You'll feel weird for a week or so but you'll feel so much better in a month or so. Good luck."Chantix. It worked for me. Really well - 13 years smoking ... decided I didn't want to anymore - failed at quitting on my own - started taking chantix. The dreams were AMAZING. I got excited to sleep!"Honestly, it was a documentary about the Appalachian Trail. I was watching it and thinking ""man, I want to hike that. That would be awesome"". And then I looked down and I was holding an unlit cigarette, the last of my pack. I looked at the TV, then at my cigarette, and thought ""I'll never do that if I smoke."". And so I decided it was time. I crushed the cigarette in my hand and haven't smoked another.

It's been a month since that night.""20 year pack a day smoker here...  I started using chantix a few weeks ago.  I've been smoke free for a week.  I've tried and failed  multiple times, but this stuff is magical. You don't have cravings, or nic fits if you will. I am super confidant that I'm done being a smoker.  ""First, I quit cold turkey. No e-cigs existed then, but I see it as ""cutting back"" - you haven't quit your habit, you're just substituting.

I used baby carrots and silly putty. Silly putty gives you something to do with your hands all the time - a suppose a stress ball or rubber band or anything else would work, I'm just a fan of Silly Putty. Baby carrots helped to deal with the hand-mouth fixation, and supposedly beta carotene anesthetizes the part of your brain that is addicted to nicotine, and cuts cravings - I really don't know if that's true, but it worked for me, so if not, it was at least a psychosomatic response.

Either way, after trying several times, in the middle of the day I just ripped up a pack, and stopped entirely.

I have to say, thinking of yourself as a non-smoker is key. LITERALLY re-imagine yourself; when you want a cigarette, say ""Why would I want that? I'm a non-smoker!""

Good Luck!  "Desire to smoke more pot... "building recording studios made out of fiberglass while wearing no mask.  develop asthma, that will help."Burning my $60 dollar pouch of tobacco with a good friend who quit that same moment. It's been three weeks. I guess junk food has helped slightly too. "Writing a list of pros vs cons. That list really puts in perspective. I did it mentally one night, and haven't smoked since. Once you realize the only reason you smoke is because smoking feels good/gives you something to do, compared to the health issues, smell on your fingers, breath etc, it's not worth it. That worked for me at least about 1.5 years ago. Just gave it up cold turkey without even giving it a second thought.""I wasnt really a heavy smoker, never went over a pack a day, so if you have more tolerance lord help you, but for me, I just smoked about 2 packs in a night. Woke up feeling so rough and nasty I couldnt even think about a cigarette without feeling sick. After about a week I oculd look at a cigarette but I would still feel rubbish, and then I just stopped"FOD"For my girlfriend, it was a heart attack. She never smoked again after leaving the hospital. That was 12+ years ago.""My grandmother has been on oxygen for years now, she has COPD, Emphysema, and chronic asthma. This past October I pulled in to pick her up for a doctors appointment to find her stumbling, unable to even walk to the car on her own, and talking out of her head. When I got to the doc they sent us straight to the ER where they put her straight on a ventilator. Her COPD was causing her Carbon Dioxide levels to get so high they told us we were lucky she didn't die in her sleep. She is only 67 years old and has been smoking since she was very young. When her levels were back up and she woke up she swore she would never pick up another cigarette. If it wasn't for her will power and ecigs she wouldn't have been able to do it. I am so proud of her and it has really encouraged me to try harder at quitting myself.""Discipline, as simple as that, say you won't smoke, and don't do it""Champix/Chantix (carenicline tartrate) After just a week, I'd gone from 20 cigs a day to 4. That was about 2 & 1/2 years ago and I've not felt like taking it up again since. I had quit a couple of times before, but both times I ended up getting on the booze and smoking again"2 weeks of strep throat and bronchitis"Really wanting to quit.  I tried many times to quit smoking using patches, gum, and anything else that was supposed to help with minimal success.  Smoking a pack, sometimes more a day.  Finally I decided to quit cold turkey and have not looked back since.  A fun thing I did for the first couple years would be to save all the money I would normally spend on cigarettes.  I would put it aside each month and save it until the end of the year.  It is amazing how much money I had spent.  At the end of the year I would use that money and take a fun trip somewhere I had never been.  It has been 8 years now and have not smoked since.  If you really want to do something you will find a way to get it done.  Good luck and stay strong.""I started out with patches, gum, drinking black coffee like it was water, LOTS of prayers, and a really patient wife and kids. Soon, I dropped the gum, then I weened down the strength of the patches with the system.
As much as missing breaks SUCKS, I personally could not have that idle time around the aroma of all those cigarettes. Way too tempting. 
Be patient with yourself. Take it ONE DAY AT A TIME. Don't get discouraged.  Every day away without a smoke is another MAJOR victory.  Before you go to sleep, every night, give yourself a pat on the back. You deserve it. You won again. 

""Perhaps the problem is not smoking at all.  Perhaps it is something that drives smoking.  I'm thinking of David Stather, a Canadian pulmonary physician, who having  advised and assisted many of his patients to stop smoking, died recently from base jumping in a wingsuit at the Grand Canyon in Az., USA.  Or I'm thinking of a recent video I saw of kids skateboarding on rooftops, grinding the edge.  Or I'm thinking of a guy leaving a bar totally wasted at 2 a.m., alone and driving three miles home.  Freud said that there is a death wish that haunts our psyche.  If smoking is only one possible avenue of many, then first we've got to deal with the driver.  Or we can just go with Kurt Vonnegut who said, ""smoking cigarettes is just a classy way to commit suicide"".""As much as it is cool to read these stories, what works for one person doesn't necessarily work for another, so hearing stories and maybe other ways to approach the problem is good to do, but I wouldn't use this as *advice*. ""Severe pneumonia worked for me. Had been smoking for 6 years. Quit cold turkey during, and haven't dragged a cigarette since. Roughly 10 months so far, absolutely no desire.

""Not me but my dad. When I was a couple monthes old, he leaned in to kiss me after smoking outside and I ended up scrunching up my nose and tried to avoid him. He said from that day on he never smoked another cig.""About 4 years ago i quite cold turkey with a few mixed methods. I did a lot of reading on the subject and i came up with a way to self hypnotize myself. I could go on for hours, but basically i traded bad habits with good ones. I overcame my mind and i lived the lie that i had never smoked in my life. Your brain will believe anything you tell it if you are strong enough and patient enough. One example of a simple change i made was when i was offered a cig. from somebody i would just tell them that ""i do not smoke"". I would not say that i QUIT. You can never start back up on something you never ""quit"".

This was just my method...and there are plenty of other ways. You have to just try stuff and go along with it. Most importantly, you have to want to quit.""If you really want to quit. Just stop. And also buy a pack of nicorette gum. But don't chew it to help you quit.  Just keep a piece on you and when you finally break down from cold turkey and you need a cigarette, step outside and chew a piece of gum.  If you can get passed the first couple days with no nicotine hopefully longer, when you chew the gum it will make you sick. And you wont even want a cigarette after.  You have to try. It is fucking hard.  Start drinking water all the time. Try and get exercise.  Replace the times you have cigarettes with physical activity like walks. By this I mean if you would go on a smoke break, go on a walk instead.  I can tell you I haven't smoked since high school and only a few times did I start up again when I drank alcohol.  I don't drink anymore either.  So I have been cold turkey for over 4 years.  Almost 20 if you don't count the times I smoked when I drank.  I feel fucking great. I take care of myself.  I never get sick.  I am 35 and get told I look like I am 26.  So that is how I did it and I am glad I did.  There are no secrets to anything in life.  You already know the answer to your question. Just be strong and stop.  ""I bought a ""final"" pack of 25 and smoked 6 the first day, 5 the next, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1. After that I used apples. I got me 5lbs of apples a week and ate them when I wanted a butt. I even still went outside with friends when they smoked, and I had an apple. Apples satisfy the hand-mouth action and take about as long as a cig to smoke."Heart attack at 44.....been smoke free since (nearly two years)"My spine surgeon told me... 3 days after the surgery... That nicotine would seriously affect how well the fixator works, and even later in life that it could weeken the bonds.

Asshole couldn't have told me this 2 months prior to the surgery..""Using the patch- but actually buying all stages and using them as directed, combined with electronic cigs for awhile for driving and after eating. I'm at day 324 and it is awesome. I tried everything else before even the laser zaps. Just stop using the electric ones when you are on the last step of the patch. ""I know this will be buried but Chantix worked for me and my wife. One bit of advice, the doctor will tell you to quit smoking one week after starting the program but don't. If you feel like you want to smoke then smoke but keep taking the pills. Eventually the drug takes over and you just stop smoking. I killed a 20 year habit in 30 days without any withdrawals. Good luck! ""The key to giving up smoking is to break the addiction to nicotine. Vaping is only replacing one thing for another. If you truly want to give up you need to change your mindset. I did it by recognising the times that I wanted one and working on that. Basically I've found that most smokers, including myself, used smoking as a beginning and an end to most things. I used it as a reward. I would break tasks up into segments and reward myself with a smoke after each one. I was almost doing it unconsciously. Say I was doing a task at work. I would always tell myself I'll get to a certain point and then break for a smoke. Or I'll have a smoke and then start the next thing. When I analysed it each time I was smoking I was able to identify the pattern. For me it was simply a matter of actually staying busy. The non smokers at your work don't get a break. So you smoke to get one. Do they just have to put up with no breaks while you take one every half hour or so. Pretty unfair. Just stay busy like them. Don't reward yourself with a smoke for doing some work. Keep working. It actually only takes a couple of weeks to break the habit. In my first few weeks my wife thought I was a super husband. I would vacuum the house, wash the dishes, clean the bathroom, clean the windows, mow the lawn and fold the washing all before lunch just to stay busy. I removed any reward for finishing a task and just move on to the next one. It worked for me. Work harder and longer. Take less breaks. It's good for your health and your co workers will love you for it. As a non smoker I now see how much less the smokers actually do. And I don't smell disgusting. 
It's all in you head. Good luck. No more rewards for just doing a simple task!!!""I got sick with respiratory infection and couldnt smoke for five days, I made the choice not to start back up. Been un hooked for 5 months but lately I have taken a drag once in a while, I know im flirting with the devil but I do it with the intention of exercising my will over it, Do what thou wilt , right?
""I've quit using several different ways, e-cigarette, inhaler, patches, but the only way I ever quit for long time is cold turkey 2+ years, and then I smoked for a couple of months and now I've quit going on a year. 
This time I also quit drinking alcohol at all because this is what always got me back to smoking. ""My friend successfully quit smoking when his father died from lung cancer and made him promise that he would stop. 

Really strong willpower on that guy, managed to quit cold turkey immediately after. "Seeing my grandma die of lung cancer. That was hard but it was the last push I needed to give it up."I used to smoke around 6 a day for about a year or two, then one day my dad (who had been smoking for more than 24 years) just up and quit because he no longer liked the smell he left behind in his room/car/on his clothes. At that point I knew I didn't have a very valid excuse, especially since I didn't have a super strong relationship with cigarettes, so I stopped. I still have maybe one when I get drunk but that equals out to around 1 every two/three weeks. MUCH better than before. 

I also vaped for a week or so, but I'd get carried away with it and would wake up with a sore throat that would turn to a sinus infection for a week. It's not my favorite thing :/"Chantix What actually worked was I didn't quit trying to quit.  "I quit with Chantix, the prescription medicine. It took two weeks and I haven't smoked since. However, my husband smokes and he has tried EVERYTHING, even Chantix, and nothing has worked for him so he still smokes. I do believe I truly wanted it more than he ever did though. "Wanting to quit instead of thinking I should quit. It'll be 4 years this April after 3 failed attempts. "5? Hah. Try 155. I lost track of all the times I failed. 5 is nothing. 

Just keep at it. Stay conscious of your daily patterns and premeditations. Don't rationalize or If you go out an buy a pack of cigs, smoke one, feel guilty afterward, and throw the rest of the pack away, don't fret the fucking $6.50 you wasted. Get over it. You're shooting for something higher. Stay focused on the goal and you'll get there eventually even if you have to ""fail"" over and over.""My grandmother was a smoker for roughly 30-40 years.  The thing that worked best for her was getting a 19-pound tumor.  After that, she was too scared to smoke again and she hasn't touched a cigarette since.  This was probably 15-20 years ago.

So...my advice is to get a tumor.""I don't do so well hearing ""no"" so when I quit smoking regular cigarettes I never told myself no I just said ""you can have a cigarette they just taste like this (e-cig) now. It worked for me I quit 08/09/10 and have never looked back. Not one more cigarette. Good luck I know you will find something that works for you. ""My dad smoked for 20 years and quit completely cold turkey one day. It wasn't until I was an adult that I found out why - apparently when I was 4 I had seen something on tv about how cigarettes can kill you, and I immediately went up to him, tugged on his shirt and said ""I don't want you to die daddy"". 

So that's why he quit.""I've been smoke free for almost a decade now after smoking a pack a day for over 10 years. I used Zyban and it worked well.  I picked my day to quit and then on that day, after taking the meds for 2 weeks I just quit.  The only side effect I had was irritability.  Tried to have a smoke a week later and hated it.  That was the moment I knew I would never smoke again.""So i'll start off by saying that i didn't consider myself a heavy smoker. 1-2 packs (20) a week. I'd mostly smoke when i was out drinking or gigging (i'm a producer). Most of my friends and a large part of my social circle smokes. I would also have a single cigarette before bed (routine i guess). After starting a regular job this year my habit picked up slightly and i was having 1-4 smokes a day.

A friend of mine who has been off Captain Blacks (cigars) for about 9-11 months showed me Nicorette's QuickMist quitting solution.

It's basically one of those breath freshener mouth sprays but with approx. 1 mg nicotine per spray. It has completely rid me of any and all cravings and even just the thought of anything to do with smoking. Even around large groups of smokers i can comfortably join in the socializing without any cravings what-so-ever.

The spray hits your mouth and throat quite harsh the first few times, like misting listerine into your throat. After a few uses you get used to it but it still hits like a drag of smoke (similar to). There doesnt seem to be any kind of nicotine high or light-headedness unless i havent eaten anything. It's basically odourless to anyone around and leave a nice minty taste in my mouth.

I've tried a few quitting solutions in the past:

nicotine inhaler (too much like a cigarette and too harsh also required frequent refills)

e-cigs (seemed pretentious didnt give enough hit and the flavours were heinous. Also after hearing about these nicotene ODs happening around them too...)

All-in-all it has been GREAT! I even TRY to bring on a craving to see how little i want a cigarette (thinking about the taste and the movement etc.) and i haven't been able to to. Been off Cigarettes since the 25th of December.

Cost is about $40 AUS but will last about a month if you are a pack-a-day smoker.

TL;DR Nicorette QuickMist is the best quitting solution i have tried, if you have exhausted multiple method and haven't tried this. Give it a shot.
""It took my father having a stroke. He was a long time smoker. Standing outside the ER and lighting up with my best friend I recall saying something like ""wtf are we doing"". NYC was providing the nicotine patch for free at the time so we jumped on the opportunity. Quitting sucks. For me the patch helped take the edge off (and the lucid dreams I had while using it were cool too). Above that there came a point where I realized that if i ever had a single smoke after that point that all of my pain and suffering during the initial phase of quitting will have been wasted. Some reptile-brain part of my psyche simply couldn't handle the idea of such waste. It takes time but it get easier!! It's been 12 years now, and honestly- It's the best thing you can do for yourself. Good luck! ""A new girl. To the people who don't smoke, people that do STINK. I smoke. I stink. If I was into a woman who didn't smoke, that would do it. I'd want to kiss her and stuff...""E cigs. The hookah stick kind. Delicious flavors and I can still run without hacking up a lung. Everyone seems to have tried the shitty cartridge ones. The hookah sticks are great and much cheaper in the long run. 
"I found out I was pregnant and had to stop. Now if I try one that shit is disgusting. Thanks pregnancy for changing my taste buds. "My wife used to smoke 2 packs a day and I rolled my own Bali-Shag - no filter cigarettes. We ended up using a few good quality atomizer e-cigarettes to stop smoking real tobacco. I figured out that the thing I enjoyed about smoking was the way the smoke came out of my lungs, so I knew I wanted an e-cigarette that would produce a ton of vapor or it wouldn't be worth it. Not that Blu e-cigarette or something you get at the corner store - has to be a good one (back in 2010 when we did this, ATL didn't have the thriving e-cigarette scene it has presently) so I got mine online from France. Now they are everywhere, so you can shop around and ask folks that use them what they like. Start on the high level of nicotine liquid, and when you've smoked it all, get the next level down. Do that until you are smoking the liquid with no nicotine. Sounds dumb, but it helped me to smoke the nicotine free liquid, that way when I got done I knew it wasn't about the nicotine. "Smoking carrots as stupid as that sounds just doing the action helped me get through the addiction I decided to quit one day.  I've never smoked since.I too tried several times. Keep up the good work. Acupuncture worked wonders for me. Going on 18 yrs smoke free."Just stop. 

I'm not being facetious, I mean it. 

Many times in the day at first you might be like... ""Fuck, I need a smoke""... but then... just don't smoke. FORCE YOURSELF. Don't buy cigarettes, don't ask for them, just DON'T

On the flip side... My boss who has been smoking a pack or two a day since 13 (now 45) recently quit cold turkey after finding out his father has lung cancer. He smoked more than anyone I've ever known and just suddenly quit... If that's not inspiration I don't know what is. Telling yourself its impossible is simply a lie that your habits perpetuate.

This did it for me in a matter of weeks, cold turkey.  8 years later, not a single puff, zero residual desire or craving, and the idea, and especially the smell, of a cigarette is nauseating.  Good luck!!!""Two weeks before I quit smoking I turned it into a chore. Every cigarette I smoked I told myself I didn't want to. By the end of the two weeks I didn't even want to look at them any more but made myself until Jan 1st, 3 years ago. Then at 11:55 I smoked my last cig and gave the pack away. My trigger was drinking. Anytime I had tried to quit before I would cave after a couple of drinks. So for the first week I drank every night to the point of getting drunk and didn't cave once. After that I knew I was done for good. Haven't looked back since. And no I didn't develop a drinking problem after that haha. ""Smoked 2 packs a day for 15ish years. Tried all kinds of things to stop. Nothing really worked great. But this year I got a fancy vaporizer. Not a cheap blu ecig but a full on refillable tank with a variable voltage battery vaporizer. It kicks out so much ""smoke"" that I feel like I'm smoking but it's just flavored water vapor with nicotine in it. It works great!!!! I haven't touched a cigarette in a month. I highly reccomend anyone who smokes and wants to quit to look into this. My current setup is a kangertech protank 2 and an itaste mvp 2.0 for a battery. Google these to learn more. Just be careful not to buy fakes. Who knew it but there are a lot of knock offs around in the vape market. "Getting sick with a double ear infection."I used sour candies to quit, specifically ice breaker sours. Every time I craved a smoke, I grabbed a candy instead. I went from a pack and a half a day to nothing two years ago because of if. ""Champix.  It was still tough, but that really did take the edge off. "Whats champix? is that different from Chantix?"I wish my mom could have had the willpower to quit. She is laying in the hospital right now with small cell lung cancer, recovering from a heart attack caused because the kemo and radiation taxed her body that she barely moved and her heart couldn't keep up. I am dreading the conversation I am going to have to have soon with my niece and nephew about how mimi(what they call my mom) is dead and won't be around anymore. 

Seriously, stop smoking.""I chewed tobacco - tried patches and the gum several times. 

I found that nicotine lozenges were the best thing. Start with the 4mg lozenges and move to the 2mg. They are fantastic because you get that instant relief. ""Two things: First, willpower, I simply swore to myself that I wouldn't smoke another cigarette and meant it.  Meaning it matters, it is easier to get through a craving if you know for a fact that you aren't going to smoke.  If you are only like ""I'm going to try..."" it kills you.  You have to be fully committed, this actually makes it a lot easier.  Second, I quit on vacation.  This meant for the first week of quitting I was only breaking the physical portion and not any of the habit portions.  When I got back home, I was settling into not having nicotine and it was easier to go through my routine without smoking.  I was a pack-a-day for about 8 years.""Living in a heavily polluted african city.When you feel your lungs get coated with all kinds of burned waste and unprocessed exhaust gases from  ancient cars, the need to smoke a (local, harsh) marlboro suddenly vanishes. I wouldn't recommend this strategy though (plus cigarettes are so cheap that a more hooked smoker might get even worse)""Instead of smoking those delicious american spirits, I switched to shitty Mexican cigarettes. Then I just got sick of tobacco and stopped. No cravings.""At 25 I got into a huge fight with my brother, who smoked and I decided I didn't want to have anything to do with him. I also came down with a awful case of the mumps awhile later which made me too sick to smoke. Those two co-incidents made it relatively easy to quit. I eventually made up with my brother but he still smokes unfortunately. "Smoked for about 7 years. Then one day i just kinda thought this sucks. Havent had one in 8 years now."I know this isn't what you're looking for and it won't be helpful. But, suddenly I started throwing up every time I smoked. It wasn't hard to quit after that.""I used a patch for about a week, then stopped, haven't smoked for over a year now after smoking for 8 years, and I must say, I feel a lot better now, and everything tastes better too.""I have a plan that is gonna get you there so listen carefully: You're gonna wanna do this cold turkey, no cutting back, it never works. 

1. Get mad! Cigarettes are your enemy, and when they realize they are being evicted they are not gonna leave without a fight.
2. Understand now what this journey entails. Its not gonna be quick and easy.  You can expect that for the next two months every 30 seconds your gonna want a smoke.
3. Make the decision now. Right now while you are of sound mind you need to decide weather or not you are going to give in when the cigarettes say ""just smoke me you sidewalk sissy""
4. Don't avoid people or places that smoke. Thats for pansies with a loser mentallity. Triggers are a reallity that you are not going to be able to fully avoid and if you try you'll give them strength. Confront them head on as if to say ""I'm not afraid of you and you're not gonna punk me around anymore""
5. Don't count the days,weeks or months. You'll get that sense of accomplishment which will cause you to lose your resolve.
6. Don't tell people you are quitting, don't hide the fact but don't tell people.

7. When you want a smoke tell your significant other about it. 

Quitter: I want a cigarette

Quitter's GF: well don't smoke one

Quitter: I'm not gonna, I'm just letting you know I really want a cigarette

Quitter's GF: ok

Quitter: I mean to say I REALLY REALLY WANT A FUCKING SMOKE!

Quitter's GF: OK!

Good Luck!""I stopped buying them. That's it. It's been 2 months and if I get angry at work, I step into a bathroom and just let it out. I hate the smell, the taste, all of it. I'm never smoking again.""Chantix. I tried it twice; the first time I got cocky and stopped taking it after three weeks. The second time, about a year later, I followed the directions to the letter.  I've been smoke free 3.5 years now, after being a smoker for almost 30 years.

May have horrible side effects, but two weeks in, you are not smoking. It worked awesomely. It took me many times to quit, but that drug plus perseverance was the final kick.

Wish me luck!!"Vaping for 13 months, seems to have worked for me. I don't plan to give up vaping, so more of a switch to something less harmful in my opinion. ""First of all, I was ready to quit.  I had just purchased a new (used) car and I didn't want it to smell like my old one had.  They were running one of those hypnosis specials at a hotel, I went and the rest is history.  That was in 1990 and I have not smoked since.  I was at least a pack a day smoker.""I have been quit for 6 months now. Honestly, I just kept cutting down more and more until I didn't really crave them anymore. I was a ""social smoker"" for about the last 3 months ( just mainly when drinking) but now I don't even want to. The smell bothers me which I very much regard as a good thing. I feel a lot better too. My wife constantly nagging me about it also helped. Haha""I used the patch (for the 3rd time). I think I needed to go through it a few times until I was really REALLY ready to do it for myself, not for someone else.

It worked out great for me - smoke free for 10 years now.as soon as California raised the tax and said it would go to are schools i quit.You have to truly want to quit."I'll tell you one thing, my grandma wasn't a quitter, and she died of lung cancer before I was even born. And my retard self started smoking at age 15 - five years later, I've tried to quit multiple times, and I've discovered two routes that work well (I'm on day 3 of another quit attempt , going strong)

1. Use chemical help, but understand its limitations. Back when I was on my mom's health insurance, I got a script for Chantix and it worked like a CHARM. Was smoke-free for 3 months, no major withdrawal symptoms. Only reason I relapsed was because my mom switched health insurance co's and the new co. no longer covered Chantix. Now I'm on patches (cheaper), and they seem to work ok, just not as good.

2. Replace the fucking habit. If you don't have something to take the place of smoking, you WILL relapse. Currently, I run. I run 30-40 mins every morning, and those endorphins feel like a shot of goddamn morphine, makes me 'forget' to have cravings that day, especially in combo with the patches."I told myself that I was going to quit and I literally just stopped doing it. Now I can casually have one if I want to.I stuck to electronic after a few days of a sore throat it just clicked i adpated to the vape instead."Wanting to quit is key, and antidepressants to kill the cravings.

Cigs still make me gag just to smell them.

 I'm amazed I scrolled miles and didn't see a single person mention it. It's one of the only ways that works without willpower being involved (you get so sick after a month of taking it). Every person I've met who didn't successfully quit on champix quit taking it/wouldn't take it after a week or so. If you take champix for a solid month, you'll puke at the smell of cigs. After 2 months there is no way in hell you could be still smoking. If someone says they've been taking it for 2 months and are still smoking, they are lying to you. They are skipping doses or just outright lying."Eating cold turkey. "For me, I started by transitioning to camel snuss while I slowly cut back on my cigarettes. (5 per day one week, then 4 per day the next, etc). Once I got to the stage of one or two smokes per day, I did that for awhile then just went 100% with the snuss and supplemented that with Nicorette gum. 

I've been smoke free for 5 years. I know it sucked quitting, but I remember thinking that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. 

Good luck!""Quit bitching and quit? Don't let yourself make excuses about why you ""NEED"" a cig. You don't. It's not like it's heroin or something :P""Just. Fucking. Stop.

I quit cigarettes cold turkey after a particularly intense mushroom experience. The trip gave me the confidence and motivation that I lacked even though I had been wanting to quit for a long time. Psychedelics are an amazing tool for combatting addiction.""I watched my father dying from emphysema over the course of about 6 years. I picked up corncob pipes, I still love nicotine, but cigarettes cause harsh death. I'd smoked them for 20 years but now i can't finish a pack of Nat Sherman OCD's. Being able to breathe is so nice.

Oddly enough, when I started smoking as a teenager, the reason I kept at it was bronchitis. I'd had debilitating bronchitis for several years before that, and when i started smoking the monthly episodes of coughing up blood stopped. ""The one time I tried really hard to quit patches worked for me. The problem was, I didn't want to quit bad enough. Despite not really having terrible cravings, I smoked a bunch one drunken night. I'm not going to try and quit until I know I hate cigarettes. I currently dislike but LOVE them. Addiction becomes more emotional for me than anything else. "Willpower "25 year smoker here, what finally worked for me was Chantrix.  Yeah, i heard all of the hype about it...no real side effects for me.

The chances of your kid seeing someone do some blow on the street is minimal. However you saying I can't smoke something completely legal out doors because you don't want your kid to see it. Well all I have to say is too bad. What I do out doors that's legal is none of your business. You take care of your kid and shelter them as long as you want. Just stay out of my life. "Smoke for over 20 years. Decided that it was time. Switched to a chemical free cig, the transition sucked -- like I cold turkey quit, it sucked. But I stuck with it, eventually I started cutting those back(after about 6 months) and switched to an e-cig for the uncontrollable rage moments.... did that for a couple of weeks, still went through the nicotine withdraws it still sucked, but I stuck with it -- it will be 3 years on my birthday next week.  
""I literally cut the cigarette by about 1/4 so that every time i smoke 1 stick, I'm actually smoking a reduced amount already. After about a month, I tried cutting 1/3 of the stick and was still smoking 1-2 sticks a day. Then i tried limitting the frequency to 1 stick a day. After that I removed the regular time I went to smoke and replaced it with something else (eating). In time I was smoking 2 sticks a week, and by then I could just leave the pack at home in a cupboard. If I suddenly have an urge a few months in, I cut the stick in half, have 1-2 puffs and throw it. The last time I smoked was 6 years ago. 

What I miss most is my cigarette friends and the alone time, also that secret brotherhood of smokers on the street, you can easily approach anyone for a light and a quick chat.

The biggest benefit is the taste buds, everything tastes better. The next biggest benefit is the sex, I can last so much longer and my partner is so much happier because of the regained endurance.

""Getting a girlfriend. 

Even as a smoker I would never date a girl that smoked. It's gross to kiss a smoker. I would always quit when I started dating someone new. Just happens that I've been together with the same girl for five years, and we're now engaged. "I got tired of feeling like shit and decided to quit. My wife joined me and we quit cold turkey. Working on two years now.Actually wanting to quit.Three months in jail did the trick for me. I had a cigarette the night I got out & it tasted so terrible to me that I didn't even finish it. That was the last one I smoked. It's been almost 6 years."Vapeing, smoked for 38 years, quit a month ago. Had trouble with cravings at 18 nicotine, went to 24 and feel great!""You have to really want it. For me it was a competition with another smoker who quit at the same time. If he could do it - so could I! I did the whole patch thing for about a month, which helped after a week. The first week I smoked probably a pack to wean myself down. 

Also a BIG motivator was my quit smoking countdown app. I was able to look at it every time I had a craving and see my progress, reach goals, and chat with other quitters. I would tell myself that o went 35 days without a cig, i wasnt going to waste that minth of my life by going backwards. 623 days now and hardly ever get cravings. (They still happen in high stress situations, but pass quickly) 

Edit: the app also kept track of how much money I saved ($2463.92 to date). But honestly, I haven't noticed the savings one little bit. ""this says more about me than my smoking addiction, but my best mate said 'i'm going to quit cold turkey. you probably shouldn't try it, i doubt you could.'

so i quit out of spite.  8 years ago. yeeee""Ecigs! No, not 'Blu' or the ones you get a 7-11 - an actual vaporizer is the way to go. /r/electronic_cigarette helps a lot :) Yes, it's an alternative not a way to quit however it's a whole lot better than smoking cigs.""The doctor saying ""You have high blood pressure."". Pretty effective when you have proof that its killing you.""For me, it was all about making the decision for myself.  I'd tried quitting for ex-girlfriends, insurance, all sorts of things- but never for myself.  Once I made that decision, I used Chantix to help me get through the cravings in the first couple of weeks... but, beyond that- it wasn't too bad.

Feb 4 is my two year anniversary.""Trying over and over again.  Most times I failed, but finally 5 and a half years ago I quit for good.  My last cigarette was May 5, 2008.  

About two months before I quit I started doing parkour and it was extremely motivating to have something I cared about to quit for.  My smoking was holding me back in my sport.  

On top of that I started becoming aware of how I used smoking to cover up emotions.  When I got an upsetting phone call or any bad news, I lit up.  When someone shunned me, I lit up.  I didn't want to be dependent on a carcinogen to manage my emotions.

TL;DR Keep trying no matter how many times it takes.  Find something you love more than smoking.  Become aware and fed up with its negative affects on your life.

Good luck!""Also, quit the e-cig.  Same shit.""What worked for me is never giving up, if you never give up eventually you will do it, I quit 4 times majorly for periods of over 6 months and fell back in due to life hardships and weakness. That's not counting the literally hundreds of times I would go from 1 hr to 2 weeks etc.

What also helped is this, lets say you try and quit and make it 3 days, you smoke, fuck, most people think all is lost there but its all how you look at it, from that smoke try and make it past 3 days and as far as you can, this is what I call rocking the canoe, it wont tip on the first push you got to keep rocking it, each time will have more momentum, by the time your hitting like 2 weeks (you have been keeping track) you could very well feel good because you gradually weaned off of an addictive substance instead of telling yourself you were.

But you are not weak ""Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength"". - Arnold Schwarzenegger 

Been smoke free for 2.5 years and stress be damned, Ill hit the weights or tear down a wall before tasting that shit again, I can barely stand it when people are smoking on the street I will hold my breath and run past them it's that nasty now.""Alright, I'm late to the party, but so far you got the same old lame advice that makes it seem so simple - ""I Just did it!"" yay, good for them.

If it was that easy OP you would have done it right? Right. 

So here is how I quit, and you can to - but I'll warn you now, it's not easy. 

First - your trigger. A lot of people cannot even identify their trigger, so you are already a head of the game.

So right now, you need to pick a quit date. Be realistic, but not too far off. A month or so. You're going to take a week off, plain and simple. Well, not so simple.

See, every time you quit, you go through phases. There's the panic of running low, the sadness and introspective of your ""last"" smoke, and then your determination (this is the stage you want to exploit), then you start craving, making excuses, and doing the *same fucking routine* as before, expecting to get over it. You won't. Being at work will make it impossible to quit if it is your trigger, so right away, take the trigger from the equation. A week off work is worth it in the long run friend!

You need to take advantage of that time in the middle - the determination part. The 4-5 days when you first quit, that you need to take one day at a time, but where you are at your most stubborn. 

So you take the week off, quit smoking on Friday night. 

Saturday morning, you sit down, and ignore that voice in your head that is already thinking of your next smoke. Ignore it, for now. Then you sit down and write 5 reasons why it is a good idea to quit - how much will you save? Your health? Your family? your future? Your kids? etc. Write those, but not just in pen, make it fancy, go overboard, take two hours to write it all out and color it.

Then fold that paper and put it in your back pocket. Good? Look at that, you've over your first craving. 

Now, go get a water bottle. The water bottle is now your friend. Why? You busy your mouth, and you are reconditioning yourself to want water when you crave. It's not perfect, but it can help take the edge off.

Now, today - today isn't so bad. You're still headstrong and you can make it 24 hours. That's all that matters right now, 24 hours. Drink your water, and if you get one of those cravings, when you identify that you've gone past the threshold, and you've put on your jacket, and books to go out to the store....STOP. Stand there, take your paper out, and read it out loud. 

See, humans are creatures of habit. You need to identify the habit, stop and reprogram. Do it up.

Get a bunch of healthy munchies for the night, and try and put yourself in a non-smoking social position.

Get ready for headaches and sweats. They can suck.

Ok, so you wake up. Yes! 24 hours, you've made it! You lift your head. take a deep breath in. Feel it. 

Drink water, as you should when waking up every time, and read your paper again. Good job. That was fucking hard, I'm proud of you.

Repeat this for 3 days, 24 hours at a time.

Now it's Tuesday morning, remember you're off from work so you get all this time for yourself! 

The thing is, the first 3 days are the hardest, so congrats, the worst is over! Now you need to suppress that voice in your head that is slowly building momentum. Don't ignore it anymore, confront it.

It's you, it's your own voice, but for right now, it's also your enemy. The trick now, is to give it something else to feed on...to show yourself the benefits of not smoking. So first of all, go for a walk! Every morning. Make yourself a nice healthy breakfast.

Plan your days out, every day of the week, so that you get as much packed into it as possible. You want to busy your mind, and reprogram your behaviors. Remember to keep your list in your pocket, and pull it out when you need it.

Now, at least once during the week, you are going to be tricked by that voice. You'll start to forget all the reasons you wanted to quit, and want to say ""fuck it"". Remember, identify, stop, and reprogram - read your list.

Now you're almost done. Remember when I said the hard part was over? I lied.

See, now that you have your good habits down, and you've gained confidence with your choice...you need to confront your demons.

Most people tend to realllly want to smoke when they drink, so now you are going to go, head high, into the night, with the knowledge that you are going to get smashed. Absolutely wrecked beyond belief. BUT, you also know that the one thing you must absolutely NOT do, is smoke. THAT is the hard part, but get through it, you can do this! You've already quit for 5 days, you've got this!

If you survive this true test, you will wake up, your mouth will not taste like an ashtray, and you will slowly make a realization - you didn't smoke!! :D Holly shit, good job!!

Repeat the drunk night, as needed. (I did it 5 days in a row!)

Why do you get smashed like this? Well you see, you are using your own ego, against that voice. Once you've surpassed this week, you've gained new habits, but you've also confronted your old ones on their terms and WON. Next time that little voice tries to get you to have a smoke, you will laugh and say ""I got drunk for 5 days in a row after I quit and you didn't get me then, there is *NO* way I will smoke now.

That's what worked for me. Good luck!

""I only smoked for a year and a half. I've gone from smoking 'only when im stressed/tired to 5-6 sticks a day. I worked at a shitty retail liquidation store so my routine would be wake up for work, eat before work, smoke before work, smoke on break, skip meal on break, smoke twice after work, smoke before bed. 

After a while I noticed the decrease in my cardiovascular health, so I decided to 'quit' smoking. But like everyone says, your routine causes triggers and just makes you want to spark up for that fleeting nicotine feeling. I ended up failing my first 'quit' smoking plan. I was back to where I started. Same routine. Wake up, smoke, work, smoke, work, smoke, go home, smoke, bed. I got sick of it.

There were times when I would easily get annoyed and smoking was the only 'cure' for this stress. I was conditioning myself to rely so much on cigarettes and I got tired of it. Ultimately, as soon as I could I told my workplace that I was leaving. I threw away my last pack of cigarettes and started working out and reading books. 
I haven't touched a cigarette in 8 months.""I'm sure it's been said already but I just stopped buying. I had been a smoker for 8 years but after a serious life change, I decided to stop. I was too lazy to take meds or do the whole nicotine patch thing so I just quit buying altogether. "Got pregnant. Cold turkey quit. Try that."I know I'm buried but before I quit, I kept thinking to myself.. I wanna grow up and have kids one day. I want my kids to grow up and have kids. I want to be there for that all. I started thinking.. Man, if I keep smoking, I'm taking myself away from that. So eventually, they started to taste disgusting, I mean, I couldn't even smoke a whole cigarette without gagging. I relapse from time to time but it truthfully just reminds me of what a good decision it was. (By relapse, I mean like one in a night.)""Whatever method you choose to use to quit smoking be it nicotine supplementation or cold turkey, you may find one powerful motivator in ultimately succeeding is getting through day #1 without one. If you can do that, you've demonstrated to yourself you have the willpower necessary and that is what worked for me. ""It's all mental strength, I have stopped started smoking 3 times I think since the age of about 14, the first time I just wanted to see how long I could go without one and I quit cold turkey, it worked for about 3 days then I had maybe 5 in the period of a week and then just stopped but after about 3 months I went back to it because I'm a labourer it's a good way to get a 2 minute breather to have a drink and such. The second time I went into hospital to have a spinal operation and when I came out there was.no urge and the third and current time is because my fiancee won't kiss me if I have had a cigarette in the past hour because I taste ""burnt"". It's all about self control dude, find something to take your mind off it or something to commit to, it's all physiological, patches and such don't do shit so don't waste your money.""Pregnancy. Not just being pregnant, but the thought of being a parent. We both quit cold turkey. Almost 5 years now. Putting yourself second really puts things in perspective."Champix fucking rocks.">  I have the electronic cigarette

Sounds like you have some regular tobacco flavored e-cig?  What you want to get is a real vaporizer starter kit, and some high quality cartriges, and some tasty e-liquids.  I recommend flavors like somoa and thin mint girl scout cookie flavors.  The somoa one is amazing, tastes like chocolate graham cracker and coconut and nicotine - it's called [Jabba's Hookah!](http://www.vaporus.com/Vaporus-Jabba-Hookah.html).  Also remember that nicotine has a peppery flavor, so you'll need to remember that if you decide to have nicotine added to the flavor.

So expand into some interesting flavors!  You can get so much nicotine it will make your body float.
"I wouldn't kiss (or do anything else) with my boyfriend until he quit smoking. He's now been vaping for almost a year and finds cigarettes gross. "I quit 4 years and 26 days ago after over 20 yrs of smoking.    I would not bother with the electronic cigs cause they still have nicotine and you will backslide faster.  The patch works to some degree, but made me sick because I was a 1/2 to 1 pack a day smoker.  Just suck it up, buttercup.  When you realize you are reaching for a smoke, just stop and ask why you want to smoke and redirect the behavior.  You are nervous in the situation, you are angry, you are (???).  then remember why you want to quit.

It takes 21 days to develop a new habit.  After that time, you will smoke and it will taste like shit.  Remember that taste.

I can say a lot about the subject, but Here's why I quit:  My son and daughter now smoke at age 20 and 24 and it pisses me off that they started a bad habit that I told them I wish I never started.  
""I smoked for nearly 16 years - wasn't really a ""heavy"" smoker by anyone's standards (maybe 10 a day, possibly a couple more on the weekend).

My wife used to bug me about it, but that honestly didn't do a thing to make me want to quit - the thing that got me to stop was a good friend of mine whose Brother (who never had a smoke or took a drink in his life, exercised, ate well - all round GGG) was diagnosed with Terminal Lung Cancer, and had to go home to his young Daughters and tell them Daddy wasn't going to be around anymore.

That was it for me, my Wife & I were thinking of trying for a Baby at the time (proud Dad of a beautiful nearly 4 year old girl now), and my thought was - ""Here's a guy who has done everything you possibly can to be healthy, and here I am doing something that is almost guaranteed to make me really sick one day"".  I quit pretty much there & then (with the help of patches), and it's now been just over 5 years.

Fortunately / Unfortunately my friend's Brother went into remission some months later, but around a year later the Cancer came back more aggresively than before, and he died shortly after - on the positive, he got to spend a lot more time with his Girls than he thought he would be able to.

I went to a specialist a few months after quitting to get a chest X-Ray - my Doctor noted that I have ""Stress Lines"" on my lungs caused by my long-term smoking - they'll always be there, but as he said to me at the time ""After 16 years of Smoking, if that's the worst that you have, you should consider yourself very lucky.""""my two ex boyfriends and my current one have all quit smoking within 4 months or less of being with me. i do not pressure, belittle, or lecture. I just slowly, over time, let them know that their teeth are getting yellow (if they are, honestly) and that their breath and clothes smell really bad, especially the morning time. It is like i do not even want their mouth near my face. They usually quit over a course over a couple months because they want to kiss me more regularly and not gross me out, as well as making their step, on their own, in their own journey. Being around a non-smoker often, you care about and don't feel judged by seems to work. I know not all can do that, but they are always happier. Me too(:""The first time I tried for real wasn't very rewarding. I managed to go without for about a month with the help of e-cigs--and felt like shit for most of it. 

A couple of months later, after having discovered hypnosis, I quit for real in an instant. It was all incredibly easy. I listened to a few recordings for a few days, then spent a few days self-hypnotizing myself. It's now been nearly an year and a half since my last cig.  ""Chantix.  I was a hard core pack a day smoker, I wanted to quit, took Chantix, and yeah the first week or two was hard but Chantix took all the pleasure out if smoking.  After that I just had to adjust to physically not smoking, i.e., I reached for a ciggerette thinking about lighting up but was like ""oh yeah, I quit!"" In addition I had some really fucked up vivid, colorful dreams while taking it, I still remember most of them.  If you do Chantix make sure you also do the support offered that goes with it.  I had a daily automated phone call from a West Palm Beach area code where I would complete a check-in, (answer a couple of questions) I made fun of it every time it called but it became a ritual and also reinforced why I wanted to quit smoking.  Hope that helps!  You can quit, I promise! "1) You stop being a pussy. 2) Realize that your a living human being and you are stronger than any shitty little cancer stick. 3) Just fucking do it!!Nicotine gum and small amounts of weed. Then six month later I had to quit the gum but it was much easier... just substitute normal gum every now and again and increase until no more nicotine gum.An eGo e-cig and a lot of willpower. "How did I quit smoking? I made an honest decision that I wanted to quit smoking and put forth an honest effort with no excuses to do so.

 I smoked anywhere between a half a pack and two packs a day for around 15 years. In those 15 years I never tried to quit smoking once. When I was nearing my 30th birthday I thought to myself ""I should probably quit smoking when I turn 30"". When I turned 30 I smoked my last cigarette. For about a week or two afterwards I chewed maybe two or three pieces of the lowest nicotine concentration gum I could buy a day to stave off nicotine headaches. After that for about a month or two I chewed tooth pics. The hardest part is I am very social(read: alcoholic) and was out at bars drinking probably 5 nights a week. Whenever I wanted a smoke , or to hang out with my smoking friends I would go outside with them and chew on a tooth pic instead. 

TL;DR if you want to quit smoking , you have to actually want to quit smoking and not be a big fucking pussy about it. "I decided to see how long I could go without a cigarette. I'm at 15 and a half years and doing it this way prevented me from ever having one because I didn't want to start counting again. Good luck - it's worth the hard work. "I'm curious which electronic cigarette OP tried.  If it was a Blu or the like, I'm not surprised at all that s/he went back to smokes.  Those are weak shite.  I started with an eGo Twist (1000mAh) with Kanger T3 clearomizers and 18mg nicotine juice from Mt. Baker Vapor.  A year later I've only hand a couple of smokes and they were awful.    Hard to believe I ever loved them like I did.  

My hope is to ween off of the vapor too, but there's no doubt I'm far better off than when I was smoking.  

I should mention the good folks at /r/electronic_cigarette were a big help.""When I quit, I just quit cold turkey.  Boom, done.  It wasn't easy, but I refused to start back up again.  After a couple months, it wasn't even weird anymore. After a couple more months, I had no cravings.  Now, 15 years later, I think the truly weird thing was that I ever smoked in the first place.  

You're not going to like this answer, but there is no trick; no gimmicks.  It's all you.  The only way to quit is to quit, period.  If you get weak and bum one, don't give up.  Just get mad and stay out of it.  If I can do it, you can do it.  You're not some junkie, and this isn't heroin.  Just stop. ""Vaping. I smoked for 16 years and tried everything to quit. I put down my pack October 5, 2013, and haven't picked up a cigarette since. ""One day I realized that I'm smoking too much. So, to show myself that I'm stronger than a habit, I decided to quit. I bought a huge bag of Chupa-Chups from Amazon and reached for it whenever I craved a cigarette. In three months I was completely over that bad habit, although I still like the smell :) Amazingly enough, I didn't gain any weight during that period, I frankly don't know why...  ""As a non-smoker, I'm just going to assume the best way to help strangers quit is by coughing in an exaggerated manner or making noises of disgust under my breath whenever I see them light up.""I got pissed. To know that I was actively filling the coffers of those detestable tobacco barons, those purveyors of incurable disease, all the while hastening my eventual demise. Fuck that. I smoked a pack of cigarettes one day and none the next. That was over 10 years ago."hypnosis (the second time)Pregnancy. Quit cold turkey haven't looked back. Take a lot of b vitamin supplements.  They help curb mood swings. "I quit in stages. That is what worked for me. I quit at home.  I quit in my car.  I quit at work.  I also met a guy that didn't like smoking, and added in the patch and gum to help those final cravings. Finally I quit when I was going out.  I realized that I had actually really quit when I went to clean and found my pack of ""secret cigarettes"" and hadn't touched them in over a year.  ""My six month old nephew was in town with his parents for a week, I didn't want to think about smoking or if I smelled or any of it around my nephew, so I crushed my pack and haven't looked back :D You can do it, you just have to want it. Believe it or not it's actually nicer not having anything to do in the car. It's peaceful. And my nose is working again which is good and sometimes bad. "Had a heart attack. Quitting was pretty easy after that. Chewing tobacco!!!!!!I eventually got tired of cigarettes. I quit cold turkey 9 days ago.Nicotine poisoning."not even kidding here, and it may seem outlandish, but I quit smoking actually by accident. I'm not totally sure why, but i did sustain a small amount of dain bramage a while back when I had surgery and they used the wrong anesthesia. so who knows how my brain works. I wouldn't be surprised if this is what caused it, but who knows.

Basically I somehow developed what I call ""The GLaDOS effect."" You know how in portal 2, glados explains that Wheatley is developing a resistance to the solution euphoria? And that she never had to push past it because she was in it for the science? Well for me, the solution euphoria was the nicotine, and the science was the oral fixation of having a cigarette in my mouth. I eventually started ignoring the nicotine completely, and only realized this when I absent mindedly rolled up a sticky note and put it in my mouth and puffed away at it for a good ten minutes while at my desk. Then I realized ""oh shit, why am I smoking inside?"" And then almost simultaneously realized ""oh shit this is just a sticky note!"" So, considering what cigarettes do to you, and considering how my brain can't tell the difference between a cigarette and a sticky note, I opted to use a sticky note instead, and that's been working out pretty well to this day. ""I also inadvertently gave up - of a sudden, on a lonesome long distance trip and after decades of almost chain smoking, I out of the blue wondered in reaching for a particular cig why I'd done so, suddenly intrigued that I was not aware of having had any thought to reach for it, and and that I'd not made any decision I could actually remember to reach for it. 

So mainly out of a need to occupy my mind or be bored out my skull, I put the cig back and drove on, waiting for a reason and a decision for reaching for that next cig to cross my mind. But that never came. Every now and then, I reached for a cig, analysed what had been going through my mind, and found thoughts there that seemed to have nothing to do with having a cig. Thinking that there maybe was a cumulative sense of what was happening, I even ""parked"" what was going through my mind using memory techniques so I could consider that cumulatively, later. But, even then I could not discern any reason or decision to have that next cig I kept reaching for. 

By the end of the 500km trip I realised I must have given up, chucked my cigs away but bought some nicotine gum just in case. But I never used it, and still about 10 years later, and I've still not had that next cig :)

So grateful about that, in hindsight:)"My wife (then girlfriend) said she would stop giving me blowjobs unless I quit smoking. No Joke!"Partly it was avoiding triggers -- managing stress better, staying away from beer until the nicotine was totally gone from my system. 
Also, I gave myself permission to call it cutting back instead of quitting. In my twisted brain, it's easier to just not smoke than to call it quitting.

But, the real thing that really really made me not actually want to smoke? My teenage daughter took it up. I will NEVER smoke in front of her again, and I hope she follows my lead ... again."Smoked since i was sixteen. Hard since I was eighteen. The day I quit was after my last pack of Japanese Marlboros. The way i saw it was Canadian cigarettes can't amount to their great taste so their was no point in killing myself. I also started workign out and I liked the way i felt so why counter it?"I had a doctor tell me one day that I *might* be allergic to cigarette smoke. I thought that was a weird thing to say and maybe they were just trying to convince me to quit.

I was the kind of smoker that would vary in my habit. Sometimes I was smoking a pack a day, sometimes I was only having 1 or 2 or none at all. But I did notice a trend. About two weeks after I would start smoking regularly I always ended up getting allergy like symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, coughing, and extreme fatigue). Smoking made me so tired I could hardly stand it and every time I quit I always felt so much better. Eventually I just got tired of being sick all the time so I made a *real* choice to quit and *never* pick up again.

As they say in any addiction one is too many and a thousand is never enough. Every time I said I could smoke casually I'd always be back to smoking more than I wanted to.""I quit cold turkey. Every time I felt like having a smoke, I would grab a piece of gum out of a great big jar of Dubble Bubble I kept on my desk. I emptied and refilled that jar several times. The physical cravings were gone in about 3 weeks, but it took the better part of a year before the psychological cravings were nearly nothing, and after about 3 years, they were gone. My lungs started clearing out, and the ""lung cookies"" and ""rice crispies"" were gone after 6 months. ""I waited until I actually wanted to quit versus just doing it because I felt like I should or other people wanted me to.  

I just stopped, no aides or tricks.  And I did it in the middle of law school, super stressful, and with a habit of going to the bar every night.  Haven't even had the urge to light one up in 3.5 years.    "The only thing that got me to quit was an actual desire to stop and never do it again.  found out weed was better!!"i switched to hookahs and ecigs, and they really help. But i think the main factor is that i now spend more time with friends and family. Because when I'm with them, i don't want to seem rude and excuse myself to go out and take a drag, plus its also lonely smoking by myself since nobody else smokes.
Its been close to 4 years since i've smoked, and i don't really have the urge anymore! :)"Champix worked for me."I am going to quit as soon as my supply of cigarettes is gone. I have enough to last probably until the third week of February. I know it's a crap reason but I just hate to waste the cigarettes I have they are solo expensive.  But I HAVE to quit.  In the past three weeks I have been diagnosed with COPD and Diabetes.  I quit for four years once before. I used the patch.  I had no problems doing it then. Hopefully this will be the same.  Plus I also know that if I don't quit the COPD will only get worse and shorten my life considerably.  Wish me luck!
"Start snusing :)I got strong e-cigs that had 24mg of Nicotine a couple hit of those gave me a huge buzz which made me not want to smoke...I quit everything 3 months later."Start doing heroin, of course""Just go to the doctor and get Champix or something similar, no need for willpower and unlike people who went cold turkey, I NEVER crave a cigarette, even after 2 years. "ITT: Quitters"Here's how I quit. The first step is to put a certain amount of time between smokes. I started with two hours then a few days later moved that up to four and then six and eventually after a couple of weeks I went up to eight.

Also blu ecigs. Highly recommended! While I was weaning myself off regular smokes I supplemented with the blu.

After I was completely off regular smokes I continued with the blu for another month.

It's been 4 months now since my last smoke. I don't really touch the exits now either but if I need to I will not hesitate to use the blu.

In my opinion the blu is a life saver. Seriously.""I quit many times before I finally ditched smoking for good. I feel that what helped most was actively remembering times when I didn't feel compelled, or out of control, of my desires and cravings. I didn't like feeling like a slave to something. On the days/nights when I'd go buy a pack of smokes, I'd ask myself what I'd felt I had accomplished, now that I had them in mouth and smoke in my lungs.

The answer was really not much. I was just a little poorer, both in wallet and in health. Constantly reminding myself of this was what changed my mindset on it most. There were other things, like not smoking because I'm stressed out, because the addiction was stressing me out more than anything it helped alleviate. I started running as well, and didn't want to hurt my improving lung capacity. I wanted to get better. So I did. Hope it does for you too.""check out /r/electronic_cigarette !
e cigs are what helped me to quit."" I had been smoking for 5 years.  I made a bet with a friend that for every month I went without smoking I get 20 dollars.  After the first month she didn't pay but I thought to myself, 'Hey I went a month, whats the point of starting again?'  And now I have been smoke free for 15 months.""I smoked  half a pack a day through college, new guy entered my life who was trying to quit.  It was the summer so we spent a lot of time together, every time I tried to get a way to smoke he would go down on me.  I am cured x) and we are still together.  However I think this would only work for couples who are REALLY good at oral and spend a lot of time supporting one another. "I stopped to impress a girl. Nothing happened but hey I stopped. Champix worked for me.. I took it for a month and quit by day 8. It has some funky side effects though"I tried Wellbutrin but all it did was remove the taste of cigarettes, not the urge. What did it for me was realizing that I had been having strange chest pains and that if I had a heart attack, no one was going to be around to call 911. My dad died alone that way. ""Moving away. I found that certain people, and certain situations triggered my habit and leaving those helped alleviate the need to smoke. "Cigarettes "I have a goal to quit for my birthday coming up. I am about half a pack a day smoker to a full pack if drinking or super stressed but its been long enough. Hide it from the kids but they are getting the age that they might understand it and that is my motivation.

Bought my starter kit for the e-cigs and started using them as a replacement to start weening myself off. For me though its not the nicotine completely, its that I am very habitual. If I drink I need a cig, if I am on a call I need a cig, golfing = cig, etc. I hardly ever have a terrible ""need a cig now!"" craving. I am just used to the habit. So thats why I went with ecigs for when I quit incase I have that moment. 

Just download the Allen Carr's book after seeing such great responses ITT so hopefully that helps. ""Mr Xenia quit last year after 40 years of smoking. He was in the ER with a heart problem. The doctor slapped a patch on him and said ""you don't smoke anymore."" 3 months of patches and a lot of white knuckle days, but he doesn't smoke anymore.""I'm a non-smoker married to a smoker for a really long time.  Cigarettes have created a problem in so many ways.  The habit has created a financial problem for two people on fixed income.  He cannot quit, has no plans to quit, cannot afford to keep his habit going at current levels which keep increasing.  Physical problems include heart plaque, continuous cough and impotence.  Why would anyone continue smoking with these problems."Chew"Months of focusing on my quit date. Then 6 weeks of the patch, followed by access to an e cig (4mg then 0mg) for weak moments. Also I got myself presents every 6 months of success (kindle, iPhone, new snowboarding outfit) - I'll feel I don't deserve those if I break. Plus I've stayed subscribed to this subreddit. I'm good and haven't caved at all but I still can't let this subreddit go...it seriously helps! You can do it!""E-cigs got me to quit.  20 year pack a day smoker.  The ecig one I got was expensive, I vowed to only use it and not real smokes.  The battery kept running out, so when I really needed a toke I had to wait for it to charge.  I eventually lost interest.  Worked for me! "[this timeline](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html) helped me"Smoked for about 8 years. Now 20+ years cigarette free.

"Stopped buying cigarettes and started saying no to offers. "I used the prescription drug Chantix. It's by no means a silver bullet though. I had used Chantix twice before when I was younger (22/24) and both times I quit for 6-8months but eventually started again because I went out every weekend and every time I drank I'd want a cigarette and next thing I knew I was a smoker again. I'm now 28 and I used Chantix for a 3rd time. I made myself quit WHILE studying and taking the bar exam. I told myself that if I could quit through that horrific process then I could keep it up forever. Also, the best thing I think I've done for myself is  analogize smoking to using heroin. Cigarettes are my heroin. I can't simply ""have a cigarette because I'm drinking."" I'll never be able to just have one the same way you would never give a recovering heroin addict 'just one needle.' When I look at it like that, I think I give myself the mental stamina to keep it up. Chantix is really great for knocking out those initial cravings though! ""Although I don't talk to my ex at all, this thread would be such a big help to him. I introduced him to reddit so I know he's familiar with the site. I just hope he's on here more often than I think. He was trying to quit before we broke up and I wanted to help him - I hope this thread can do that for him. I wish him the best.""Tried to stop smoking 3 times before I actually had to stopped seeing my friends who smoked for a month. Was hard but they didn't want to cooperate and their presence just made the process really hard.

Right when I stopped smoking I started going to the gym also so after the month I started seeing my friends again and they were exactly the same and I was so much healthier and confidence of my self. 

They saw that and finally understood and they did the exact same thing. 3 stopped and 1 is still struggling.

That was year and a half ago.""I hated how bad it was making my teeth look. Switching to Cigars made it quite easy to stop, then just gradually reduced the cigars, which I found less addictive. "Hypnotized.. 15 year 1 pack a day smoker.   Got Hypnotized and haven't taken another cig since. . 12 years and countingsmoke what..."Honestly, cold turkey worked best for me. I haven't been a smoker for more than two years, and it's pretty much exclusively because I said ""no mas"" and meant it.

I failed at quitting twice previously: once cold turkey (for about a year) and once with e-cigs (which lasted 6 months or so).

I will say that part of my thing was that I got back into the dating scene, and there are far more girls who dislike smoking (including my GF) than who smoke, so that kinda helped.""Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking.

When my father quit smoking he did it by keeping a pack of cigarettes in his nightstand so that he could go back to it any time he chose to. The point was that if he was going to quit it was going to be a conscious choice, not simply a matter of not having them. I've always thought that philosophy is badass""cold turkey
""The sheer thought of that pack owning me, not the other way around, for the rest of my (possibly short) life.  The urge comes now and then but you have learn to let it come and go, not fight it, or impulsively act on it.  Guided Audio Meditations help greatly, as well.  Seriously, it's great to be free.""I've never smoked, but a guy I worked with was an avid smoker for about 15 years before he quit. Last I heard from him, it had been 7 years since he smoked. 

To quit, he just kept delaying each cigarette break for as long as possible. For example, he'd say to himself, ""I'll smoke in 10 minutes."" and when the 10 minutes expired, he'd say to himself, ""I'll smoke in 10 minutes"" and so on. This slowly but steadily shortened how many cigarettes he'd have in a single day, until finally he could go a whole day without, and then a whole week without, and now hopefully the rest of his life.

For this method to be effective, it was important for him to generally be a busy person, which wasn't hard as a married businessman with 2 kids who has a bunch of extra-curricular hobbies.""To be absolutely honest there was nothing except my own will. I smoked for 10 years non stop, decided i would stop before 30. 

What **may** have helped me was the fact that i told pretty much every friend i have that i would stop smoking on the 26 of august. That day, i did, and if i ever return to the addiction they will all be disapointed and disprove it. I know it may not seem as much, but the sheer fact of disapointing all your loved ones as well as yourself is pretty awfull(for me at least). 

That helped me through the beginning and still does, 5 moths 26 of january since i quit so i guess it means something, good luck to you my friend and i hope this helps you even if not much.

""After years of pestering my mom, I realized nobody else can make you quit. You have to want it yourself. Which is understandable, but disappointing.

She literally cries every time someone brings up her quitting smoking. She smoked throughout her pregnancies with all four kids. My brother had asthma and she never quit smoking around him. Went to school smelling like cigarettes all the time...my third grade teacher asked me if I smoked...""""Reassociation"" was my successful technique.  Start going outside for a smoke and try your best to do ANYthing else.  Stare at the sky, take a short walk.  I found it helpful to train my mind to go elsewhere when it wanted to smoke.""I stopped trying to quit. Instead I started playing a game. The game, go X percent longer between each smoke. ( I chose 10, 5 works too). Eventually the time got long enough I could just continue indefinitely.  End result, if I broke, I wasn't a loser. I just had a goal.  Never failed, just fell short of the challenge.  The goal wasn't to be in pain forever, it was just to stand the pain a little longer, then relief.""This may be unpopular, but constant prayer asking that the cravings be reduced... ""I got bored of smoking. I was at a pack every day or so, then I was smoking like a pack a week, now I sometimes have a cigarette or two on the weekend. I have no idea what happened, but I've also lost weight, broken out like I'm 14, and stopped wanting to chew gum ever. Possibly dying, but also my cravings to smoke disappeared so possibly this is okay."I quit cold turkey. I was bitter and angry for a bit but I got over it. It helps to have something to do with your hands. I focused on drawing comics and kept straws and toothpicks and stuff around to keep my mouth busy too."When I actually quit, I was already down to 3 or so cigarettes a day.... so as much as the ""quitting gradually"" doesn't work.. Its a lot easier than quitting cold turkey from a pack+ a day... the ultimate motivator was not wanting to smoke anymore. If you actually don't want to smoke, you'll want to stop. I dunno, YMMV"I lost my job and had to choose between food or cigarettes. An antidepressant called welbutrin. Cigarettes just weren't the same after that. "I took a class.  A classroom class that I think was put on by quitplan ( https://www.quitplan.com/ ).  The most helpful thing I learned was that it was safe to do the patch and a nicotie replacement (I used a prescription nicotine inhaler). I also used everything else that might help from gum to toothpicks to a worry stone to coffee stir sticks. I was also motivated by my 4 year old son who has asthma. It will be a year for me on the 9th.

This podcast has changed my life not just with quitting smoking but everything. ""I'm 26 and have been smoking since I was 18. I had a daughter who was a premi and had lung problems, So I cut back smoking alot. Didn't smoke at all at home, but still managed to smoke a pack a day at work.. My dad who has been smoking for 20+ years bought the Blu and quit within a week.. He gave it to me, in 3 weeks I had quit. I love it, I even work with a shit load of smokers and it still doesn't bother me. I suppose I had enough.""Zyban. 3 days in I literally lit a cigarette, took a drag and dropped it. Weirdest thing, I felt like I had just finished 2 or 3 in rapid succession without the sick feeling I'd usually get from chain smoking 2-3 or more.

Then I later in life started again and quit after I calculated how much I'd save on an annual basis.""I only smoked for two years, but I quit cold turkey.""Seems contrary to common sense but it was simply knowing that when I decided to quit, I would quit.  It wouldn't be this 'have to try this or that, struggle or 'go back to it', it would just be, I quit, and that point forward I knew I wouldn't start again.  When making the decision it can't be this very serious, effort thing.  It has to be made light-heartedly, knowing it was true.  

On top of this I was aware of two things.  1) the physical addiction lasts around 7 days.  2) The routine/habit of grabbing a cig, putting something in your mouth, puffing on it, while watching tv, driving somewhere, etc, makes it necessary to get rid of the cigs the moment you make the decision.  Don't throw in trash, tear and crumple them up to make them non-smokeable. Done.  I thought frequently about for about 6 weeks, then the habitual thoughts went away.

Eat them in the car while driving. When I was quitting it was in the car and walking between classes that were the worst. I finally was able to quit successfully, and didn't even gain weight. Sunflower seeds will keep your hands and mouth busy and fill your stomach slowly since they take time to open.

I had previously tried cold turkey , cutting back, the gum, the patch, counseling, hypnotism, all multiple times! But sunflower seeds really did the trick for me. I actually still eat them while driving now, 15+ years later.""Male half here: smoked for 6 years. I quit cold turkey. I nailed it to the wall and used it as an example. I didn't want to let a rolled up plant control me. 

My dad quit after 30+ years the same way following my lead.

Now I'm amazed I could have ever smoked. The smell is repulsing and it follows you everywhere. Being a ex smoker I can literally smell someone smoking in the car in front of us with the windows up. ""Yep, definitely nailed it.""I used an electronic cigarette with a nicotine level of 24mg.  Used a strong, overpowering tasting e-liquid (menthol/cinnamon blend).  After a week of exclusive use I couldn't stand the taste of tobacco, even one that were heavy on menthol.

From there I reduced the nicotine dosage by 2mg every 4-6 weeks (basically whenever I ran out of liquid).  Once I got down to 6mg I started reducing by 1mg whenever I ordered.  Over the course of two years I went from a pack a day smoker to vaping nicotine free liquid.

After that it was just a matter of breaking the physical habit of vaping.""Here's a couple of tips. Keep trying, about 7 times on average in terms of quit attempts 
-change your toothbrush (avoid nicotine residue) 
-make your car smoke free
-increase water/decrease caffeine 
-if you need to smoke within 30 minutes of waking more medical interventions may be needed to reach success (medications  counselling)
-try walking during your breaks at work

Good Luck!"Vaping got me off cigs for good. I did some research and found a real nice vape combination and I never looked back. I tried crappy ecigs you find at gas stations and they do not work. Get a real one! "I wanted it badly enough, or better **I wanted something else more than I wanted to smoke**.

Then I quit, no excuses, no just one here and there.

Everyone needs to find their own reason that motivates them enough. I wanted to get pregnant and my doctor said smoking doesn't help with that so I quit because we had tried a while at that point. I wanted something else more than I wanted to smoke.""my friend (healthy, young non-smoker) getting cancer.  made me feel like an asshole.  dropped the pack i had and seven months later haven't looked back.""It may not be much but just find the right  electric cigarette, my sister and I haven't looked back since we purchased ours. Yes, an actual cig. Will always look better but recognize that an e-cig still gets you the nicotine you ""need"" and that's what it's about, you don't need the tar and chemicals, you don't even need the nicotine (but yes, the nicotine is where it's at man) treat it like a reward for yourself, as unhealthy as that may sound the nicotine from an e-cig is better for you than nicotine + tar + chemicals.""I had a cancer scare. I'm fine, but it was the kick in the ass I needed. Haven't smoked since. It was the hardest thing I've ever done and I think I'll always crave cigarettes a little bit."Medical Illness. That shit makes you stop. "My mom quit a few months back. She switched to nicorette lozenges. She said she couldn't do the e-cig because it reminded her too much of smoking a real cigarette. Once she hits the one year mark she is going to slowly quit the lozenges.
But good luck op. I hope you find something that works for you.""Quit cold turkey 11 years ago.  Best motivator was the Rewards of Quitting chart.  It gave me milestones to hit.  

On a stranger note, Tony Danza.  Yep, Tony told the story of how his father quit smoking and it resonated with me.  His father kept cig in pocket and when urge hit he'd take it out look at it and say ""Who's stronger? You or me?""  ""What worked for me was to:
1.have a real desire to become a non smoker (sounds obvious but still). 
2.identify why I smoked. To do this I tried to identify when did I most enjoy smoking, which cigarettes were better: the one in the morning, after lunch, with beer, with friends, alone, before bedtime... this helped me identify what kind of smoker I was, know your enemy style...
3.just think about all this and try not to forget the reasons why I smoked
4.reassess that I still wanted to become a non smoker, and start skipping one cigarette or two at a time
5. keep going like this, no culpability for still smoking, but knowing better my habit and gathering ways to fight it
6. wait till one moment comes, to me it was a bronchitis. 
7. stopped for 3 days, with half a pack of cigarettes still on the table.
8. tried to smoke one after 3 days, but it was disgusting... I stopped

edit: This method came to me after I read William Boroughs book on How to stop smoking (I can't find any link online ... help?), fun Boroughs never did stop smoking. Just did not want to stop apparently!""My wife quit, then nagged the fuck out of me till i quit. ""You stiiink"" ""I cant kiss or have sex with an ashtray"" grrrrr

I'm now addicted to that instead, and have become one of those crazy runners..""Someone told me that they quit and how log ago it seemed. They said they forgot that they ever smoked in the first place. They FORGOT. This had never occurred to me, that there would be a time that I wouldn't even think about it anymore. That it would be so easy if I could just make it to that point. Getting to that point is the hardest point, but to have it in sight is empowering. 

That, and someone told me ""if you don't feed it, it will die."" It sounds silly, but it's true. The little kids and chocolate analogy is a very good one.

As for how? I quit cold turkey. That was that. ""I tried quitting with a normal ecig, and i ended up smoking both. There were my buddies at work who always rounded everyone up for a smoke like every 2 hours. 
I quit on the first and this is what I did:

For one, the main smokers at my job are no longer with me, so that took a bit of pressure off. 

Two, I started with the step 1 patch, but quit wearing them 2 weeks in. Haven't worn one since but I think the initial use helped the early cravings.

Lastly, I moved up from the small, basic ecig to a larger style vaporizer with a stronger eliquid (24mg menthol). I have not smoked a cigarette since Dec 31, even out at bars, and I feel great and accomplished. I'm waiting on my next bottle of juice (18mg menthol) and hope maybe I can move to near 0mg.

An ex told me I tasted like an ashtray, which prompted me to quit. Then six months later my roommate tempted me while we were drinking. Continued smoking for a couple lousy months, and this time I was more conscious of how it negatively effected my life. I went to Chicago to visit a long distance boyfriend, whom had quit as well, and decided I would finish my own pack from North Carolina and not purchase a new pack in Chicago...or ever. I bummed two while in Chicago, but that was the end of smoking cigs for me. I love not relying on cigarettes. The smell will be just horrendous to you in about a year.  My tip: go on a trip somewhere, and let it change your life. Good luck to those in the process of quitting. Great job to those of you who have. : )""1st time, quit for 2 years when I found out I was pregnant with my son. This time, going on a month, got an upper respiratory infection that made it really difficult to breathe even without taking smoke breaks. So for 3 days, I was too sick to smoke. After 3 days I figured my streak was too good to break when I was inadvertently achieving one of my 2014 resolutions."Not being a little bitch that lets some dried up brown plant control my life LOL."Dont get discouraged. Everytine you quit you learn what helped and what didnt work. There isnt one special cure all to quit. Try to think of your breaks as fresh air breaks and not smoke breaks. Delay the cigarettes for at least 20 minutes (thats when cravings are the strongest) if after 20 min you still want the cigarette then smoke it, but at least you put it off by twenty minutes, little accomplishments. Also try cutting up straws and stuffing them with cotten. Some smokers miss the ""pull"" so sucking on the straw can give the same satisfaction. Good luck and just keep trying until the quit sticks"It was too cold last winter. I quit without consciously trying to.Someone to quit for. I never could have quit for myself. I quit for my wife."By the time I left the Army, I was up to a daily can of Copenhagen dip and 2 packs of Palm Malls. I drove across the country w/my sister and didn't want her to know, so I went cold turkey. Officially the worst time in my life, ever. And I just left a war zone lol Point is that the trip took 2 weeks. By the time I got back to my home state, I was so neck deep in PTSD that nicotine was the furthest thing from my mind.""Keep a list of the reasons you want to quit close at hand.  Read them when you crave. Actually write them down. Addiction is a weird thing and makes you forget or ignore why you are quitting. 

Keep reminding yourself that quitting is actually harder than staying a non smoker. Everyday it's easier.

I had tried twice before and been a smoker for 11 years (I started when I was 17). I was smoking more than 2 packs a day when I finally decided to step down and ultimately quit (it was over $300 a month in Texas where a pack was costing about $5 at the time for my brand). The hard part is not the physical craving or the immediate stress. The hard part is breaking the habit of reaching for the pack. It was so automatic for me. ""I sent the email. Time for the cigarette."" **reach**. ""I finished dinner. Time for the cigarette.""  **reach**. ""I see this conversation leading to an argument."" **reach**. 

What I had to do to get passed this automatic response was catch myself in that moment. I didn't say ""No more smoking!"" I said ""I'll wait 5 minutes."" Then if I made it 5 minutes, I'd go ahead and have the smoke. I broke the automated response this way, and then 5 minutes became 10. 10 turned to 20. 20 turned to an hour. An hour turned to 2. 2 to 4. 4 to 6. And then for about a week I gave myself a single cigarette at 10 PM each night. I DON'T recommend that last part. It just keeps the withdrawal symptoms going. 

Another trap I'd catch myself in routinely went like this:

""I sent the email."" **reach**

""Oh wait. That's right. I'm waiting 5 minutes. Sweet. I caught myself"" **reach**

The ""catching myself"" itself started to trigger the reach. It was funny for me even at the time, except when the flicking of the lighter made me realize how close I'd come. 

This is why I think the e-cigarettes can be a failure crutch. They let you keep the physical habit of reaching for the pack (or the e-cig in this case), which means you're constantly one reach away from the real thing. 

Another piece of advice that may be more personality dependent is the idea that ""I'm going to smoke (thereby killing the quitting attempt) in order to spite person X."" It became my ""punishment"" for other people annoying me. ""Oh yeah? Well I'm going to go smoke this cigarette, so HA!"" It's screwy what the brain starts doing as an automatic response during quitting. 

I don't recommend telling anyone outside of the immediate household until you are completely passed the symptoms (3 weeks is a safe bet). Telling others makes your brain think you've accomplished something, and until you've fully quit, you haven't. Tell your immediate household of your intentions and warn them that you could be testy for a couple of weeks, so please try to cut you some slack if you snap at them. I was a mean SOB over the tiniest things. It passes after about a week and the successful days start to build on themselves. Don't listen to fast paced music. It amps you up and you will be very impressionable. I know 3 people that have successfully quit long term and none of them did it *for* anyone other than themselves. I know some very willful people that have failed. Most recently was a wedding present for her daughter. It lasted 14 hours. 

I quit 8 months ago and started working out within 2 weeks. I managed to lose weight during, which is contrary to most people. I've since lost about 75 lbs. (so far) and my recent influx of willpower has made me a force to be reckoned with. I replaced the smokes budget with a nice gym membership and I'm still coming out ahead. 

Quit. It's worth it. Don't do it for anyone else. It's for you. You can ALWAYS find an excuse. You have to recognize the excuses when they pop into your head and crush them immediately. You don't need luck, so I won't wish you good luck. You have willpower. You just haven't decided to use it. 

Do or do not. There is no try. "I actually slowly started lowering my intake over months. It took a long time but was extremely effective. I haven't touched a cigarette in 2 1/2 years. Before I stopped completely I was down to half a cigarette every few days. I still experienced withdrawal symptoms but they weren't nearly as intense as when I tried to quit cold turkey. Cold fuckin' turkey.I stopped being a bitch and quit. "I caught my daughter in the backyard trying to smoke one of my cigarettes. Haven't had another one since.

His birthday was two weeks away so we decided to quit on that day. Come to find out 2 years later Dad started smoking pot instead. "I know this works for very very few people, but my mother smoked for over 40 years, she only quit when pregnant with me, and my two brothers and then started up not long after we were born. One day she had enough and just quit cold turkey, she couldn't use the nicotine patches because they would give her terrible nightmares and didn't like the gum. But she's hasn't smoked now in like 5 years. ""Everytime I quit it was fighting a cold or flu. Coughing after every drag was hell. I'm done for good now. I wanted to live longer, exercise and was tired to smelling like a Mexican prostitute's taint. ""I forced myself to believe that smoking was so disgusting it would make me vomit. I just visually linked it with disgusting things in my brain. Rotting food. Worms. etc..Worked like a charm. Haven't smoked in 10 years or so.
""I had to change my mindset from that of a smoker who is trying to quit, to that of a non-smoker.  Non-smokers don't need to smoke.  They don't have cravings for smokes.  They don't need a break for a smoke...   They just don't smoke.  That's where I wanted to be.

I also used the patch to help with the physical craving.  Don't skimp here- the generics are worthless.  I started with step 2, and cut them in half.  They contain enough nicotine in them to get me through the day.

That's what did it for me.  I heard a lot of different methods on here, but that's what helped me.  Maybe it'll help you too.""It got to become to expensive. I bought a bunch of groceries and held out in my house for a few days. that was about 2 years ago, and I have not smoked since.""Switching to a pack that isn't my brand. Next time you buy a pack, change it up to some nasty American spirits or something.  In between chewing on cinnamon toothpicks works great. ""I smoked for 14 years, maybe a pack a day for the last 5-6. I got the book by Allen Carr called 'Easyway to Stop Smoking', read it and when I got to the end of it, I just... stopped smoking. It was the easiest fucking thing I have ever done. If you are a smoker and want to quit, seriously, try this book first, it has a HUGE success rate. It has no scare tactics in it, you are SUPPOSED to keep smoking while you are reading it (which is when I read it, every time I went for a cigarette) and by the time I got to the last chapter, I had 2 cigarettes left and I could not WAIT to get rid of them and be a non-smoker. It's not hard. Good luck to everybody trying to quit ! :)
""Not smoking. 

I'm one of those rare few who can't seem to get addicted to cigarettes. I smoked for several years straight, going over a pack a day at more than one point, and quit cold turkey when I wanted to start working out again.

Never had a problem, nor an explanation. "Manning up. Realizing that this is the most pointless list of compromises and $ that is not producing anything even CLOSE to a positive result."I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. Physically, cigarettes left me lightheaded, dizzy, tired, and on the days when I would have one too many, incredibly nauseous. I mean, think about it. You're putting carbon monoxide (along with a metric fuckton of a bunch of other things) into your bloodstream constantly.

Mentally, I never smoked to celebrate anything. I smoked because I was stressed and couldn't deal with my problems (no matter how trivial) head on. I smoked to bond with my ex boyfriend. I smoked when I got dumped. I smoked when life sucked. I smoked because I was bored. 

I wanted to quit. I had always loved running and couldn't do it because I couldn't kick this obnoxious habit. I couldn't even run a 5K because of it and embarrassingly had to stop half way through. I work in cancer research. I knew all of the physiological implications of what I was doing. 

I woke up one morning and had my usual cigarette. I guess I had eaten something weird of picked up a bug because I threw up ten minutes later. After that, every time I tried to smoke I instantly felt nauseous. Through some sort of Pavlovian conditioning, I decided to quit cold turkey. 

I'm not going to lie about this part: quitting sucks. I had done it once before and withdrawal will drive you to moments of temporary insanity. Make sure your friends, family, and coworkers know that you're quitting. They'll be a little more understanding if they know what you're up against and can hold you accountable.

Arm yourself. Pick up a new hobby, preferably an active one. I started running almost daily and am happy to say that I am training for a half marathon. Exercising now helps me de-stress. 

Drink a lot of water. Buy a big bag of baby carrots or carry apples with you. The crunchy sensation really helped me during particularly difficult times. Chew gum.

Finally, whatever you do, don't cave. You got this. Refuse to let your life be controlled by a stupid, cancer causing, awful smelling, expensive habit.""I quit because I couldn't afford it anymore. It was either cigarettes or groceries. I didn't want to quit at that time; had tried twice prior but they were pathetic attempts. I quit cold turkey and used the site whyquit.org. That was 7 years ago and I haven't had one puff since.

I also helped my boyfriend quit cold turkey. He's been quit for about a year now.""Physical illness made me quit. When I started feeling chest pain when lighting up, I quit immediately. "Getting Pregnant! Stopped straight away!"I smoked for 12 years and tried the patch and gum.  The patch kinda helped, but gave me horrifically vivid nightmares no matter when I took it off before I slept.  The gum really didn't help at all.  Really, I loved the ritual and action.  I found the e-cigarette really helped.  

I made a real effort to only use the e-cigarette and to stop when I felt I had puffed enough.  I quickly realized, lighting up a cigarette committed me to smoking the whole cigarette.  But with the e-cigarette, I could take 1 or 2 puffs and be fine for hours.  Eventually I stopped using it altogether.  The biggest challenge was drinking.  

I'd use the e-cigarette, but honestly, it never hit the spot.  So I'd break down and have a smoke.  I'd say the e-cig weaned me off nicotine cravings while sober within 3 months.  I worked through not smoking while drunk for about a year.  Throughout the year, I'd try to bum less and less while drunk and depended more and more on the e-cig.  Eventually I wouldn't bring the e-cig with me and I'd force myself not to smoke at all.  After a year of never carrying an e-cig, I can say 99% of the time I am cigarette free.  About once every 2-4 months or so I'll be having a real special night drinking with old friends that still smoke.  I'll bum one and never look back.  I will always have a craving, but I don't feel the strong pull or withdrawal anymore.

It would be unfair for me not to mention I met the girl of my dreams who didn't like smoking and I genuinely found a ton of motivation in leaving that part of my life behind to continue life with her.  I also chew about a pack of gum every 3 days and I'm brand loyal.  My nature is compulsive and routine.  I certainly have replaced my smoking habit with chewing gum.""I really enjoyed the really weird dreams.  They weren't nightmares just really way out there.
""Quitting smoking is a matter of deciding in your mind that it's okay to have an unfulfilled feeling or unmet need in your body for a while; it's a difficult feeling at first to get accustomed to, but the urge to smoke quickly dissipates in a matter of days to weeks.""A quitting buddy. It really helped me. Also, realizing that it's habit forming and not really ""addictive"".

The battle was not easy but stay the course.  The first couple weeks are a bitch and than once it becomes a new habit it is not that hard at all.  I loved the process of smoking but hated the price and health implications.  I personally used the nicotine gum.  It doesn't taste great and it is not really gum but it helps take the edge off.  The first couple weeks are the ones you need to fight through.  Once you are a non-smoker you will look back and wonder why you didn't do it sooner.

Good luck buddy - I know you can do it!""Like anything else you want to accomplish in life, you have to actually want to do it. Just saying you want to quit doesn't mean you actually want to quit.

To sum up, if you actually want to quit it is simple.""I know they don't advertise them as smoking secession aids, but the E-cig worked for me.  I bought the smoke stik, that came with 2 batteries, 1 pack of cartridges, a case, and a charger.  Cost around 100 dollars.  Which I thought was pricy, but a carton of smokes cost me 35 dollars at the time.  I was on the E-cig for about 3 months, and then stopped using that.  My girlfriend used the same method about a year later and quit smoking as well.""I also quit while working an insanely stressful healthcare job, and I counted my first year on December 2.  I'm a bit late to the party, but here's what worked for me if it helps:

1) Nicotine patch.

2) I started taking it seriously and treating it like an actual, life-threatening addiction, instead of a ""bad habit"" or something that was ""all in my mind"".  I started looking at NicA's website (like AA, for smokers).  Started learning relaxation techniques and planning what I'd do to deal with triggers when they arose.  Thought, journaled, and soul-searched about why I smoked, and how to deal with not smoking.  Basically all the things the little pamphlets that come with a box of patches tell you to do that you think you don't have to do because you're special.

3) Reddit's not big on this, but religion helped me a lot, personally.  I made a promise to my gods that if they helped me with the things I couldn't control, I'd do everything in my power to manage the things I could.  Every time I came close to lighting up, I'd ask myself, ""Are you really doing everything in your power?  Are you living up to your end of the bargain?""  And would find the strength to keep going.  Having an outside source of strength and accountability helps a lot.

Also, I had the same problem with breaks at work.  I started taking five minutes to do breathing exercises or grab a cup of tea/coffee; incidentally, this also taught me that caffeine hits you a lot harder after you quit, so watch out for that :).

"Being too broke to afford them."I was able to quit smoking after over 17 years because of drinking like an idiot one night. I tried many times to quit without success, but one night I was able to quit with even trying.  
  
One night I went out drinking with few friends. Unlike other times, I didn't have any food before or during the heavy drinking. No wings, pizza, fries, chips, peanuts, nothing. However, I was smoking heavily and drinking more heavily. Beers, shots, Jonny, etc. I drank so much, by the tome I got home, I headed directly to the toilet to assume the puking position.   
  
Next hour or so, I was puking and dry heaving so intensely that my body was almost in shock. I have never felt so much pain from throwing up. I finally passed out on the bed.  
  
Next morning, I got up and had the worst hangover. My head was hurting, and my body was aching from puking. But, what's different was that I had no urge to smoke. I had no desire to hold the cigarette. My body had no need to smoke.    
  
I believe what happened here was that my brain and body needed to blame something for the puking I did night before. Sometimes when I puke from drinking, my brain blame the food whether its chips, wings, or nachos. This time, my brain and body could not blame the food since I didn't eat anything! So, what's next thing to blame? CIGARETTE!!!! Incredibly, my brain and my body subconsciously blamed cigarette for puking so much.   
  
Since the, I have had no desire for cigarettes. It's been over 15 years since I was FORCED to quit. I feel so lucky, and thankful. ""Congratulations, you have discovered a powerful psycological effect known as [conditioned taste aversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_aversion).""family member got cancer. Went from more than a pack a day for almost ten years to nothing, never touched them again."It is funny how I was the dumb 15 year old that scoffed at these anti smoking adds. If I could go back I'd never touch a cig or chew. I've gained nothing from it and lost a lot of money. "It sounds trite, but cold turkey for me. I moved away from the smokers I hung out with, and my wife doesnt smoke"cocaine.Chantix...the side effects are mostly from previous problems...like getting a mental disease (already there {underlying}) The only major side effect was the dreams...but worth it in the long run...nothing else worked! I already have an underlying disease (PTSD) since i was a child. It took 3 months before the major symptoms that smoking susided started to surface...now i take meds for my PTSD in place of smoking."Go to the gym. Get on the treadmill and run as hard as you can (honestly) for 10 minutes straight. Then go work out for about an hour - really go for it. Get to the point where you are going to be sick. Leave quickly without a shpwer and chain smoke a few smokes. Puke. Try and smoke again in a bit... You will feel terrible. It worked for me. 

6 years smoke free from a deck a day. ""I was a smoker for 10 years. I came down with a case of acute bronchitis, which was exasperated by my occasional asthma.  It was one of the worst health experiences I've had in my life.  Wheezing every morning, difficulty breathing, coughing and terrible discomfort all the time.  The doctor told me if I kept smoking, it would become chronic bronchitis, and I would live every day like that. That scared the shit out of me.  That summer, I worked in Santa Fe, NM, an altitude of 7,200 ft.  Difficult to breathe for anyone.  I just stopped smoking, and started climbing mountains. After 10 weeks of living there, I got back to sea level, and the desire was gone... even though I am married to a smoker. ""my wife and i had to tighten our belts and drastically cut spending for a while  

so we budgeted very little personal money... we got into an argument when i got to bitching about an extra expense she incurred when she finally reminded me how greedy i was for not using my personal money for smokes... i ""budgeted"" it in with other bills   

i didnt even think of it that way, nicotine was so much a part of my life that i subconsciously considered it a need

i instantly felt like the worst person on earth and have not smoked since... 8 years baby

 "Cold turkey. "My wife got pregnant and I quit. Honestly the thought of dying of something so fucking stupid as cancer from smoking and leaving my daughter fatherless was all I needed. Obviously this scenario won't work for you. Just do me a favor, look in a mirror and ask yourself ""when will my life matter?"" You can be healthy and live a full life or you can suck oxygen through a hole in your neck, your choice.""Hypnosis worked for me. I had tried cold turkey, nicotine patches and a previous attempt at hypnosis (which failed after one smoke free week). It was 10 years before I tried hypnosis again. I went to about 3 sessions (every 4-5 days) and have been a non-smoker now for 5-1/2 years. 

The hypnotherapist helped me understand that I used smoking as a a reward. At the gym, I would set goals such as: ÛÏDo another quarter mile or one more set, or another 15 minutes, then you can have a cigarette.Û At work, I would say to myself: ÛÏOnce you finish this task or deal with this issue, youÛªll deserve a cigarette.Û 

The biggest challenge was unlearning the smoking habit and replacing it with something else. Instead of a cigarette in my hand, I held a pencil, instead taking a drag off a cigarette, I took sips of water, and I had a constant supply of  mint flavored hard candy to mimic the cool smoke sensationÛ? that first weekend I ate an entire tub of Costco chocolate chip cookies. By myself. I don't think I was bitchy, but my SO may have a different memory of that time. The hypnosis definitely took the edge off.

In actuality, quitting wasn't nearly as difficult as I imagined it to be. It was more the fear the how much discomfort I would feel while kicking the habit that sabotaged my efforts to quit.

Good luck to you!


"Pregnancy. As soon as I found out I was pregnant I just went cold turkey. Haven't had a craving for one in 6 months! "I had gotten sick, to where a cigarette would practically make me pass out from fatigue.  I replaced the oral fixation with fruit and vitamin pills, and did not hang out with any smokers.  If someone would light up, I would just walk away to avoid the temptation.  I will still walk away from people who are smoking by just politely excusing myself.""I quit about 7 months ago, cold turkey. I smoked about 10 a day for 11 years. I have quit before but never this long, and I don't want to start again. I'm convinced that it's purely mental, which means you can quit right now and never look back if you find that one reason that makes sense to you.

What made sense to me was analyzing why I smoked in the first place. I smoked because it guaranteed me a break at work. I then realized it wasn't the cigarette I wanted but the break. So I started to take breaks without smoking during them. I would take a drink outside with me, coffee, tea, water, soda, what-have-you. I would sit down outside and drink my drink and breathe the fresh air. I deserved the break because I worked long hours. My employer understood that I needed the break because I worked long hours. It would clear my head and pump me up for some more work! I felt good about myself because I didn't smoke and I felt better physically because I didn't smoke.

I also found out I could be pre-diabetic if I don'y change some health habits, and of course smoking was one thing that needed to go.

An older guy (""Jeff"") I worked with a couple years ago told me the story of his own cold-turkey story. He had smoked for 20 years when his son was born premature. The baby had to be put in the incubator with a bunch of breathing tubes because his lungs were slightly under developed. Jeff wanted to go smoke a cigarette but couldn't get out of his mind how selfish he felt. He felt bad that here was this newborn baby gasping for life while all he wanted was a cigarette. He quit that moment and never looked back.

Take your break but just don't smoke. Play a game on your phone or drink a cup of tea. You deserve the break and I think your employer needs to understand that. Shit, you're working in the healthcare field! You need to set an example of good health and strong will."Personal vaporizer man. Start with high nicotine and ween off. Quit cigs cold turkey. "Cold Turkey man. Best way. Hardest thing to break when going cold turkey isn't the craving for nicotine (personally), but more the break in schedule. If you always have at cigarette at 1pm after lunch, then it's hard to keep that out of mind. If you're finding a certain time of day really difficult, fill it with something else. I liked filling it with drinking, but I don't know if that's your idea of progress.""Where do I begin...the only way to STOP smoking and end your slavery to nicotine is to NEVER smoke a cigarette or consume nicotine again. Period. 

I personally quit smoking cigarettes and consuming nicotine by reading and listening to Alan CarrÛªs The Easy Way To Stop Smoking after a close friend of mine recommended it to me and said it had helped his mom stop smoking after 20+ years of addiction. I will forever be in debt to my friend and Alan Carr for saving my life. 

The book is exactly what it sounds like, a guide to stopping smoking for good. I acquired the audio book and listened to it every time I was in my car (one of my biggest triggers). I highly recommend this book for reading/listening to because it completely pulls apart the myth surrounding smoking and boils the fallacy of smoking down to two things: drug addiction (to nicotine) and brain washing (the brain washing we implement on ourselves to continue to smoke and the brain washing that exists in popular culture). The book even recommends you continue to smoke until youÛªve finished reading it. This may sound strange, but I promise by the end of the book you will not want to smoke another cigarette or consume nicotine ever again. I could go on and on about how great this book is but really you just need to read it (or listen to it if you find British accents as refreshing as I do). Wish you the best. And remember the only person that can put the cigarette up to your lips and proceed to light it and smoke it is YOU.

TL;DR: Read Alan CarrÛªs The Easy Way To Stop Smoking

*Edit: After reading some comments that recommend E-cigarettes, I feel that I need to add that if you are trying to stop smoking then consequently you are trying to stop ingesting and consuming nicotine (because it is the addictive chemical in tobacco). You cannot replace smoking cigarettes with smoking e-cigarette as they are ultimately one and the same because they both feed the same addiction. You wouldn't suggest to a heroine addict that they try heroine to combat their addiction, would you? It's the same with nicotine as both addictions manipulate the reward system in our brains to ""trick"" us into perpetual but habitual addiction.""I started the /r/keto diet for weight reasons in 2011. About 6 months in, I decided to try to quit smoking cold turkey after failing multiple times. I had zero cravings after the first week. Only time I crave a smoke is when I pig out on sugar/carbs, so it is definitely related for me. ""I got a really bad sore throat and physically couldn't smoke for about 10 days. One day driving home from work while I was feeling a little better I thought I'd try having a smoke. 

It was disgusting and still hurt. I threw it out the window and haven't smoked since. That was over a year ago. ""cold turkey. just stop. i allowed myself to eat whatever the hell I wanted for a while to help with the cravings. also mindfulness and breathing-feeling the craving and letting it pass instead of reacting to it. once you get past the hard part there's no turning back! you'll start thinking of yourself as a non smoker and you won't want a cigarette ever. good luck!

also, as many seem to be saying, a significant other to tell you you fucking stink really helps. maybe get yourself one of those.""You need serious motivation and maybe a bit of a scare.  My dad was diagnosed with cancer in June '13, around the same time I noticed my cough was sounding a lot like his did several years ago.  I couldn't walk up the stairs in my house without being out of breath, and my son asked me if smoking was going to make me live in the hospital too.  I am only 2 weeks in, and using my ecig like a pacifier still, but the cravings for a real cig are few and far between.  When I walk through a crowd of smokers outside of a truck stop now the smell offends me.  I didn't want to quit, but I knew I had to.  I loved smoking cigs and now I've just made my brain accept that I love vaping just as much.  "2 packs a day. Spent a whole year at one cigarette a day less per week till I was smoking 1 a day and then quit 1 weekend. 6 years without a smoke by spending 1year always aware that I was quitting. It's hard work but well worth it! "This might not help, but become acutely aware that your craving is something you can control. If you want a cigarette, look at your watch and wait 30 seconds. If you still want a cigarette, repeat this process. You'll learn that by waiting, the craving will go away, and by doing this you break the cycle. Rinse, repeat, profit.

It's hard, but get it in your head that its a chemical addiction and you just need to break the cycle. Best of luck!""It was weakening my teeth. One day I was smiling and a piece of one of my front teeth cracked off. I had to file it down smooth, so one of my front teeth is just a little shorter than the other. I realized I couldn't risk my health or teeth anymore, that they would just continue to weaken and maybe fall out. I quit cold turkey. I still wish I had quit before I ruined one of my teeth, though. ""Honestly haven't had a cigarette in 4 months after smoking for 8 years... just straight quit. I quit for a week before it then smoked 2 and thought ""why?""...so I just stopped.""One simple life change got me to quit smoking AND lose 90lbs at the same time.  My wife & I started swinging.  Both were crucial to me being able to hold up my end of partnering up with attractive couples.

tl;dr  To stop smoking, start having sanctioned extra-marital sex with randoms.""Nicotine patches worked really well for me. Basically, you quit the physical ritual/habit of smoking cigarettes before you quit the chemical part. Then you wean yourself off the patches and you're set.

I don't remember whether or not the patches worked for me the first time I tried, but I do remember that however many attempts I made with the patches went better than my cold turkey attempts."Got real sick the rolled with it. Didn't want to smoke while sick then when I got better I finished cold Turkey."I watched my Mom wither away and die from lung cancer. Her Doctor looked me straight in the eye and asked me: ""You do know this is hereditary, right?"" 

Quit cold turkey the day of her funeral and never smoked again.""I dropped from Reds to Lights and mixed in using my ecig at 24mg so I could get used to using it for 1 month.  When the last day of the month came, I just threw the cigarettes out and never looked back.  There was about a week of mood swings, but not too bad.  I have worked my way down to 3mg and pretty much plan on staying at this level.""Whenever the craving would hit me, I'd make myself remember:  having another smoke just sets me up to have this feeling again, later. If I don't have a smoke, this craving will grow smaller and smaller over time.  Plus, nicotine has to be one of the lamest buzzes/highs ever, totally not worth the addiction. Also, meditation helps.  Finally, quitting a bunch of times helps.  I have been cold turkey smoke free for a long long time
""What worked for me was having a buddy. We kept each other accountable and almost made a competition out it. Whoever smoked first, lost. It's been 18 months now and I still get the occasional craving (right now, when talking about it), but I feel so much better!! Good luck, my friend!""This thread has a bunch of replies, so this comment will likely get buried. I smoked for roughly 9 years. When I quit smoking it was because I finally had decided I actually wanted to. I had smoked the 4-5th cigarette in the pack, and it finally sank in that I was being a weak and pathetic human, who was unable to overcome the chemical that it voluntarily put in to its body.

I decided that I would no longer be weak. I was driving my car while I made this decision. I almost stopped at a near by 7-11 to throw the rest of the pack away. Instead of throwing the pack away I placed it underneath the speedometer on my car. My theory was that if I really wanted to quit it would make no difference whether there were cigarettes around. In previous failures I had thrown the pack away or waited until I had finished the pack and then tried to quit. When I wanted a cigarette I could just go anywhere and buy more. So if I wanted to quit it was about willpower overcoming the addiction. 

I had a 30 minute commute twice a day, and I left those cigarettes there for 4 weeks (maybe longer). I left them there until I felt comfortable that I was actually over the addiction. I didn't smoke a single one after I decided to quit.

That was 3 years ago, and I have never gone back."I stopped buying them. Cant smoke them if you dont have them.Stop feeding the nicomonster. Every time you crave and it feels worse and worse just remember that it's the death rattle of the nicomonster inside you. Laugh at it and just think about what a fucking asshole it is for trying to make you do something you don't want to do. (Over 1 year off em) cold turkey is seriously the most straight forward way."This thread is pretty big already, but I'm going to leave this here anyway.

It's been almost 3 years for me.  I can't really say I quit cold turkey, but the series of events that led up to my last really helped.

The best advice I can give you: Break your habits!  Don't quit all at once, first quit smoking at all the cliche times:
1) stop smoking in the car
   3 years before I quit, I got a new car and decided not to smoke it up.  Eliminated 10% of my habit right there.
2) stop smoking inside...  Cold winters and hot summers help you not want to light up
3) stop the rituals...  
   Don't smoke one first thing when you get up, wait an hour or two
   No more after meal cigarettes(One of the hardest to give up)
   No more smoke-breaks.   But don't forget the breaks...  Take your 15 minutes and just relax, read Reddit or something (do it away from your desk or you'll get dirty looks from your boss)

Then work on some more positive steps
4) set goals...  
   Give yourself a daily limit...  Then cut back every week
5) start exercising...  
   Run, lift, pedal... hell, do jumping jacks...  Anything that leaves you out of breath and gets your heart pumping (except sex, it always made me want one after).  If you do it right, the exercise will start to feel good and become its own incentive.  

The final step for me was a series of coincidences. I had already cut back to a one or two a day at this point.   

I got a cold and quit for a week while I recovered...  Though that was protocol; I got at least 3 colds every year and if I didn't stop smoking, I'd drag them out to 2 or 3 weeks.  (Now, I still get an occasional cold...  But only 2 in the last 3 years...  And they barely lasted a week)

Then, everyone at work started talking about what they were giving up for lent...  Now, I'm not religious in the slightest, but I figured what the hell, I'm 7 days without, what's 40 more.  Don't underestimate the effect of making a commitment to sacrifice with a team.  It was hard at first.  But Good Friday came, and I just decided I didn't need another.   

Hanging out with old smoking buddies was hard...  Not smoking while drinking, even harder.   I must admit I had one relapse at my little brother's bachelor party, but those were the only 2 in the last 3 years.

The hardest part was living with my gf who had no real intention of quitting.  I talked her into most the habit-breaking above, but couldn't get her to stop the after-meal smokes...  And the just-one-more-before-bed smokes...  And the my-drink-needs-a-friend...  You get the point.

I am happy to say she finally quit a few months ago with the help of ecigs.  Which, with a lack of any real research showing them to be any worse, I highly recommend.   She just cut down to 18 mg juice the other day. 

Honestly I don't know how I really managed to keep the right frame of mind.  I just decided it was time and told myself ""I'm a former smoker now""

Though, side note: One of the strangest psychological issues I had was my dreams.  Not a recurring dream per se... But at some point during the dream, I would realize I just lit up and have a panicked realization that I had already quit...  it was the worst feelings...  Sometimes it would wake me up.

Tl;dr:  break your habits incrementally, cut down to as few as possible before trying to quit for good.



   ""Think of quitting as one decision not a series of daily decisions.  You decided not to EVER smoke cigarettes.  Not should I smoke one today?  no. should I smoke one today?  no.should I smoke one today?  no.should I smoke one today?  no.should I smoke one today?  yes.  It's just one choice.  You never smoke them.  That's been my way because it solves those days where you really want one.  Then again, I bought a pack yesterday.""Not smoking.

Well, that is combined with not living with someone who smoked, who I drank with, and who smoked when he drank. I drank every night, I smoked every night. I drank all day, I smoked every day. I moved out and lived on my own, and didn't feel comfortable drinking alone.""I'd been struggling to quit for years and finally did after a weekend of heavy partying left me quite literally without a voice. Like i couldnt make a sound. The cigarettes were just one piece of the shit pie I was serving myself, but as a someone who loves to sing I had to quit before I did permanent damage.

I quit cold turkey. The thing that's kept me going is a ""its been this long sonce i smoked a cigarette!"" counter app. Seriously, seeing one month on that screen felt way better than a cigarette.after one year, I bought myself a banjo to celebrate! It's now been one year 8 weeks 5 days 2 hours and 27 minutes. I've saved $852!!!"Chantix was the answer!every time you want to smoke watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0E3ngmndEc"Coughing up blood at 19 from smoking a pack a day for five years is the best way to quit. Cold turkey the next day, haven't looked back since. 

Seriously though, you just have to stop. It's that easy. Except, ya know, replaced the need with food now I'm overweight so....that happened. At least I don't smoke anymore?"My wife had a baby. Wanted to see her graduate college. Quit cold turkey after a 15 year pack+ a day habit."As silly as it sounds, I would write in a notebook every morning, ""Don't smoke today"" with a little box next to it. When I went to bed, I would check the box if I didn't smoke. If I did, it would make me feel terrible so I only let myself do that once! Worked very well.""This is how I did it... I hope it helps!

I used it for three days and haven't smoked since. 16 years ago. After I was done with it I gave it to a friend, not sure how many days he used it but he too stopped smoking 16 years ago. I was 30 and I had smoked since I was 14 so it wasn't only the nasal spray, I really wanted to stop smoking and stop hacking up lung cookies."Actually honestly deciding to quit and the patch. I smoked for 23 years I started when I was 8 years old.I dont smoke but my coworker who came from Mexico told me that it is too cold to smoke outdoors here in Canada. So she just quit smoking"My parents (smokers since early teens) and 2 of my best friends quit on Champex. 

It's an anti smoking pill and if you can handle the side effects it works remarkably well. My dad quit after a fortnight on the pills. He said he had vivid dreams, sleep disturbance, but that smoking just seemed pointless after a while. So he stopped and never started again. My mother didn't take the pills but stopped when my dad did and would have picked it back up had she not started to notice the smell on people who did smoke. It turned her off for life. They haven't smoked in 4 years now. 

My best friend was on Champex for the full course because she was a chain smoker. She hated the vivid dreams but got through it and the excess cash she had from not smoking was a big reward for keeping going. She hasn't smoked for 3 years. 

I say give it a go. I don't know what the healthcare system is like where you live, but here the pills are 105 bucks unless you have a low income health care card. In that case they are 5 bucks. ""Honestly, I just stopped. I just said okay don't buy anymore. The first three days will be tough, ignore it and get through it's smooth sailing after that. Now, I'm smoke free
"Just stopped cold turkey. I also stayed away from everyone I knew that smoked. Also helped that I quit right before cigs got really expensive. "After 27 yrs of smoking, I used Chantix. I'm 5 months no smoking. I miss it terribly, but I feel fabulous! "E-cigs. not those shitty cig-a-likes but the real deal. Honestly if you want to quit switch to vaping."Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking. 
It is a self hypnosis book. I listened to the audio book on a long car ride. I learned about it on Reddit a long time ago and it worked like a charm. The best part is that you can still smoke the whole time you listen or read the book.""Getting pregnant.

I know that's not an ideal solution (nor is it even physically possible for half the population), but I could not quit for myself. The addiction was just too insidious. 
However, knowing that were I to continue to smoke while gestating my child, he would be born ALREADY PERMANANTLY ADDICTED (due to the brain's neural programming that develops in utero when exposed to nicotine) was just too much. So I quit.
"Download an app that tells you how many days you have without smoking. That's what did it for me. "I smoked for 15 years and quit on my first try. And it has been 5 years since I've had a cigarette. I was pretty serious about wanting to quit and did a lot of research. I asked a lot of questions of ex-smokers like you are doing and also read a lot about it. I came up with a plan:
--switched to a brand I did not like as much
--cut down from over a pack a day to 10-15 cigarettes a day. I did this in about 3 months.
--used the nicotine patch. I did the entire system, not skipping any of the steps.
--compensated with snacks during cravings. Try to pick healthy ones!

It was really tough, but when I'd find myself wavering I would ask myself ""you've already gone through all this, all this torture, do I really just want to quit now? It will all be for nothing."" This actually worked for me. The longer I'd go without smoking, the stronger I felt about not giving up.

Now, it's easy. I rarely think about smoking. I have never had a cigarette again, since that day, and I don't plan to try it. Honestly, I don't trust myself and do believe I could get hooked again so I don't do that ""just one"" or ""only in social situations."" 

I'm happy not to ever be tempted to leave my home or a party in the middle of the night because I am out or almost outbid cigarettes. I'm happy not to smell like cigarettes. Or having to step outside or rushing through the end of dinners because I want to smoke. Or those awful nicotine deprived hours in an airport. Plus, you already know, the health benefits.

Cigarette's just went past $1.25 and there was no way I was going to walk 3 blocks.   So on Nov. 21, 1990 I quit cold Turkey.   I had hallucinations.  Cold Chills,  Headaches.

Monday was better, every day got a little better."Met a girl + father dying of lung cancer + working as bartender and cleaning out ashtrays: nonsmoker."Quit unsuccessfully several times. Successful for 34 months this time. The secret is simple: Make the decision to be a non-smoker. Permanently. Everything else falls into place. Gum, the patch, vaping all puts off the inevitable. Make the decision, tough out the first couple of days, and it's done. It is really that simple. Guaranteed. ""I was never a pack a day smoker, more like 3-5, sometimes when I drank a lot more. I knew I wanted to stop, but it's hard, even for someone who didn't smoke that much. 

I did two things. The first was keep in my mind that I wanted to quit. Internalize it, become absorbed by it. Then think of an alternative. 

One day when the night before I finished my pack, I went to a local vape store and picked one up. This is not an e-cig. It's not designed to look like a cigarette. I bought it, started using it, it's a smoother pull than an e-cig and creates more vapor, so immediately I knew this could work better than e cigs (which I had also tried). 

This is where the first part came into play. It's obviously not an exact replacement, so I needed to rely on the idea that I no longer wanted to smoke + having a viable alternative to get my nicotine and oral fixation fix. I also went on walks with it the same way I would with a cigarette.  

So far I haven't looked back and frankly, like this better. I can smoke, or ""smoke"", inside without the smell, no longer have to disrupt something to take a smoke break, etc. I'm very happy with it. 

Good luck. ""Hit a good vape shop and invest in a good rig, no disposables, or Blu's, they are crap. Buy a good quality rig.

I know $100.00 sounds like a lot of money, but here in Nevada, I was paying upwards of $7.00/day for my habit. A bottle of vape juice costs about $5 and lasts me a week. so I was spending around $200/month just to pollute my lungs. and I had been a pack a day smoker for over 30 years.

By the time I was ready to switch, my voice was raspy and phlegmy, and I was always trying to clear my throat. Not good in corporate meetings.

A month after I switched, my voice was back to normal, and my wife couldn't bitch at me for vaping in the house or car, because there was no real smell.

Bonuses: My company is a non-Smoking campus. Smokers have to go off property to light up. I just go to my car.

No more ash burns in my clothes or car.

I don't smell like an ashtray.

I confuse the hell out of the rabid anti-smokers.(Smug bastards don't know how to handle it. Not smoking was what they wanted, but they can't handle the fact that somebody, somewhere, sometime is throwing them a gleeful double handed helping of 'Fuck You""!)

I don't pay vice taxes to the government any more. (It's bad enough in Nevada, but Cali and NY just plain Suck!)

I have been smoke free for the last 6 months, and ! can really smell when a smoker comes in the building.

Bums don't bother me bumming cigarettes.

And I have a better chance at a healthier life.
"Blu"Try Wellbutrin.  It can help insulate you from urges.

- Not a pharmaceutical rep"E-cigsGet a better e-cig. I have a nice little set that has kept me from smoking for over 4 years now. My doctor (cardiologist) is pleased with my improved oxygen absorption and lung function."When you finally have had it, and are really ready you suck it up and go cold turkey. Count the days and celebrate milestones. 1 days, 2 days, a week. Two weeks, a month, months, and finally years. ""My father (as a child) would sneak away his dad's (my grandfather's) cigs every time he bought them and flush them down the toilet. I'm not sure what transpired exactly from that, all I know is that soon after a streak of my dad doing so my Grandfather quit cold turkey and hasn't smoked since. He's healthy and enjoying his later years. Makes me glad I have time with him, and makes me admire that sense of commitment my dad has always had towards family.""when i was 7 or 8 i asked my deadbeat dad to stop smoking for my birthday present (my birthday was the one time of year he bothered to see me) and that apparently worked, at least that's what he told me at least. ""In all honesty, I just quit buying them. They were draining my wallet. "Nicotine Gum. Takes your body out of the fight and makes it easier to break the mental habit. "running out of cigarettes, then smoking weed for a few weeks until i stopped craving"The day I bought my first kit I threw all of my cigarettes away. Along with my girls. And told myself that this is it. She also picked up a kit and quit analogs with me. I'm obsessed with vapeing now. She just got her first PV a zmax mini. Pink color haha. Me on the other hand want more and moreChewing on McDonalds straws whenever I goy a craving. Worked like a charm. "Easy simple logic, I just though that I couldn't keep smoking all my life. If I was about to stop someday, might as well stop now, so I did. It might sound stupid but it worked for me.""The book ""the easy way to stop smoking"" by Allen Carr. Really changed my life! I won't write some crazy long post but it just made something click and I never wanted a cigarette again. 

The book however didn't completely rid me of the urges for something in my hand while driving, after eating, etc... So I did buy a cheap electronic cigarette from the mall for the times where I was really agitated. I only used it a couple times a week for about a month though. Just to kind of ease myself away and make sure I wouldn't get so irritated that I went and bought a pack of smokes. It was more to control the habit withdrawal though. Hopefully you understand what I mean!

Edit: I should mention i haven't smoked since October 17th, 2011! And now the smell of it gives me a headache. ""I wanted to be able to run again and get my body in good shape. A girl broke up with me and I felt it was necessary to get back in the game. More than that though, something I see ring true with alot of commenters of this thread, is that we had a reason to quit, and that reason gave us the follow through. The neat thing is you can make your own reason, it can be as simple as ""I dont wanna be a smoker"" its mind over matter at the end of the day, you just gotta learn how to play your brains games.Edit: words ""Chantix.  

Smoked from 15-29.  Always said I'd quit before 30.  Took two weeks, I stopped mid-pack without barely trying.

Has weird dreams, but I always have weird dreams.  Hardest part was it tearing my stomach up in the morning; adjusted to eating a full breakfast before taking to deal.

Finish the 12 week program to keep urges at bay.

Protip - if you drink and still hang out with a lot of smokers, backwoods cigars. I used those for crutch times for the first couple years, but never took more than a single puff on a cigarette after my quit day.  Now I still have one occasionally.

After two weeks of no cigs, you realize how fucking convenient it can be to not constantly be thinking of your next smoke.

""I got a corporate job which required me to wear nice suits everyday. I didn't want to have to dry clean my outfits anymore frequently than necessary.  I also didn't want to be THAT PERSON who would get into the elevator and stink it up with the smell of tobacco emanating from my pores. So I stopped smoking except when I drank alcohol.
Then, I fell pregnant and quit for good. This is an extremely effective method of quitting smoking except for, you know, the parental-responsibility-for-life thing. "N1H1DO NOT COUNT DAYS JUST GO AND NOT SMOKE"My father says everything is fated - smoking doesn't change facts. As in, smoking doesn't matter. He uses the cases of people dying because they quit smoking or despite it as evidence. What do I do?""Honestly, for me it was going cold turkey.  But a bad break-up got me right back on the ol' cancer sticks, so for all the good that did.  I just recently got an e-cig which was doing wonders for me until I lost it.""I did various ecigs off and on for a few years. Finally I found a setup that works. My GF smokes and it's just awful. I can smell her across the room when she walks in. Now that my senses have healed from not smoking it's crazy. Now that I can smell it, it's the thing that keeps me from smoking. I will admit, I've had a couple drunk cigs in the last couple years and I take a few puff and have to put them out. It's as bad as it smells haha. I also did both for a while and eventually quit smoking altogether. "Girlfriend"The biggest thing that worked for me, over 9 years ago, was (no kidding) being truly ready to quit.  I'm not saying you're not.  I'm just saying that I had to be.  I had ""quit"" once before, but had not yet truly given myself up to the reality that I ""cannot smoke like a gentleman,"" to borrow from the good folks in Alcoholics Anonymous.

I would like to be a casual smoker.  A social smoker.  That's the way I drink, actually.  I can drink whenever i want, and I can not drink whenever I want.  It's up to me.  Some people can't drink that way, and I can't smoke that way.  Not today, not ever.   I'm ""a puff away from a pack a day.""

So, more details.  I didn't have a ""last cigarette.""   Once I decided to quit, I was already done.  That might have helped.  I had a full pack, which I ceremoniously threw in the garbage can on the way into Walmart to buy Nicoderm CQ (the three-phase patch), which is the next component of my success.

The physical addiction to nicotine must be dealt with.  You can do that cold turkey, but I didn't.   The patch system is a very good way of dealing with the PHYSICAL addiction to the drug.   That will get you through hour-by-hour.

The next component:  Counting the days.  Yes, just like an alcoholic or a drug addict.   ""I've been off cigarettes for 3 days.""  Then 4.  Then 19.  Then 71.  I counted the days until my count was well over 1000.   Then I switched to years.   That counting will get you through days, weeks and months.  But it won't get you the whole way.

The whole way comes down to an absolute determination to not smoke again, not ever.  I will admit to weaknesses.  I will admit that I probably would have started smoking again if I thought I could get away with it.   My family would smell it on me.  I mean my wife and kids, not like my parents.   Even when I'm away on business.  And I will admit to have thought about it.  Not seriously thought about it, but just casually.   I would have to deal with those clothes somehow.  Just the thought of being a sneaky son of a bitch with my smoky clothes is always enough.

The closest I ever came since I quit.  I was in Vegas (strike 1).  I was at the bar of a casino with a friend who smokes (strike 2).  I had quite a bit of alcohol in me (strike 3).  I still don't know how I didn't smoke that night.   But I didn't.

You said the only way to get a break is to smoke.  Not true.  Coffee breaks.  Bathroom breaks.  You think smoking is the only way to take a break, because it's what you're used to.   And I will also mention that this was an obstacle for me.  I had to MAKE MYSELF get up and take a break.  Take a walk.   Learn to juggle.  Develop a coffee addiction.   Anything.

I love that I'm not bound to cigarettes anymore.   I really am grateful to not be a smoker today.   But I do miss it, and I always will.

I hope this is helpful.  Good luck to you."Hypnosis. I smoked a pack a day for ten years. Did a three hour group hypnosis session and have been smoke free for 7ish years. "Electronic cigarettes. Smoke free since September 2012. Haven't slipped up once.

Had smoked for 35 years. I finally reached a point where I just hated myself for being week willed. Hated the control smoking had over my day to day life. 
I then decided that I would be honest with myself and admit that I will ALWAYS be a smoker, but one that chooses not to smoke.

11 months choosing not to smoke now, feels good and I am happy with the choice made.""Chantix. I just read through a ton of comments and didn't see anyone mention it. People joke about the side effects ... I had none. I was a bit grouchy because I would crave cigarettes and go to smoke one (you can smoke the first week) and it would taste AWFUL in a very bizarre way. I've never tasted anything like it. I took the pills for 1 month. Stopped smoking 852 days ago :) I also downloaded an app called iquit-that tracks so many awesome things about how long you have quit. I was at a pack day. So far I've saved $4,499.89 on cigarettes. The one that gets me most is the TIME saved that I would've spent smoking cigarettes. 94 DAYS OF MY LIFE I would have been outside smoking and instead I spent it ... well who cares, I wasn't smoking. I LOVE not being a smoker anymore. *Edit: wanted to add, my insurance (Aetna) covered chantix 100% **edit again: a word. ""ecigs, quit within a week.""I'm late.  But asthma. I've had asthma my whole life,  it got better and even pretty much went away by 19. Then I started smoking. 3 years later I had real bad asthma.

My boyfriend had a seizure brought on by a combination of smoking cigarettes and weed. Apparently that is his trigger which we found out after the fact.

I had chest x-rays done to make sure nothing was seriously wrong and from that point on I told myself that I will quit smoking so that I don't feel like I might be dying every time I'm sick.

It's been about 3 years and I have no temptation to smoke whatsoever.
""When I had my lung partially collapse three times in two months. I'd only been smoking for one year and was 16 at the time, and what was weird was they couldn't even find a cause for it; it just happened. It scared the shit out of me so I cold turkey quit for good. Before the lung issues, I'd been trying to ""cut back"" which didn't work, because I kept trying to sneak one when no one would notice.""Cold turkey and determination, mmmmmm"I had to want to do it on my own and just stop completely. The gums and patches and all that shit never worked for me. I'd always made half assed attempts to quit and whined about how hard it was until I just stopped cold turkey. I was in a shitty mood for a few weeks but eventually I quit having the urges to smoke and never felt like picking the habit back up. "I went on an big health kick- cut out coffee, gum, sugar, white flour and cigarettes all at the same time and started exercising.

However, I've noticed that the worst about cigarettes is how they go with everything.(i.e. before; food; after food; with drinks; time-keeping...the list goes ON) It's seems like they fit with everything. While, in reality they detract you from most of those activities... You have to rid your brain from the constant nagging. Don't let yourself focus on those things, and keep your mind occupied.

"Wellbutrin "What made me stop was the fact that I needed to stop the bullshit and see smoking for what it truly was. I didn't enjoy it, it was going to kill me, and it put me in shackles. I was a slave. And the lie I kept telling myself was ""I'll quit one day, when I'm ready, Ill just smoke sometimes, This is a bad week because work is really stressful, the holidays are coming up, I like to smoke,etc. 9 years later and I was still in the same place I was in before. Wanting to quit but always feeling like I couldn't. My sister in law found out she got oral cancer. She's a 26 year old healthy women that's never smoked a day in her life. And when I found out I asked why her and not me?! Im the heavy smoker I should be the one with it not her. I struggled for a couple of months after finding out, thinking about quitting and hating the fact that I was smoking and she was prepping for surgery. Than I just asked myself. What's it going to take for me to finally stop? I don't want to end up like those 60 year old women you see outside the hospital wheeling out their IV bags to have a smoke. After getting myself psyched up to quit I got home and lit up again. That night I wasn't feeling good and ended up having the flu. I had it for 3 straight days and couldn't even get up let alone have a smoke. My throat hurt so bad and I just kept thinking if this hurts, imagine what cancer would feel like. It kept me from smoking not that I really wanted to at this point anyway. When I felt better I had already gotten over that 3 say nicotine withdrawal so I just kept going with it. The thoughts I had before I quit were still there so I just kept reminding myself of them. Everytime I looked at my sister in law I knew I was doing the right thing.The longer it's been the easier it got and I just kept picturing that little nicotine monster dying inside of me every withdrawal pang I had. My advice for others would be to read ""The Easy Way TO Quit Smoking"" by Allan Carr. He's a genius. And to also stop coming up with excuses and just look at it for what it is. Take it one day, no one minute at a time, don't think of the future of not smoking ever again because you'll get scared. Just take each moment as it comes and go through the motions. The withdrawal is short and it won't kill you. Keep thinking of killing that little monster. "11 years ago when I went on my first date with my now wife.  She hated cigarettes.  I never had another since.  Distraction is keyProbably really late but I lost my grandma in November 2012 to lung cancer and my girlfriend lost her grandfather in April 2013 to emphysema. Seeing the hurt it caused in both families made me realize very quickly I didn't want to make my girlfriend or son go through this 50 years from now. I remember being there after he died and just looking around at everyone and walking outside to my car and grabbing my half full pack of cigs and just throwing them away. I bought an e cig the next day but I only used it heavily for the first few weeks and then sporadically after that. Now I never use it at all. I smoked for 6 years and as of January 28th I made it 9 months without a single puff. Everyday that I can run around with my kid without getting winded I know made the right choice"I read a book called ""stop smoking"" by somedude Lovelace, Richard maybe.  He was a hypnotist, did group seminars.  My girlfriend went.  I read her book that she got there.  Smoked 3 cigs while I read it.  Haven't touched one since.  25 years ago, and counting.  Smoked two and a half packs a day, every day, for about 15 years before that.  The third day without, was the roughest.  You don't ""quit"".  You ""stop"".  ""Quit"" carries negative connotations.  I remember that from the book.  The book consisted largely of logical facts such as that.  And, you go for 8 hours every day without a cigarette(sleep).  Man is the only animal stupid enough to purposely suck a noxious poison into his lungs.  Taking deep breaths occasionally is largely the same thing as smoking.  Works for me.  The suggested substitute was cloves.  You buy them in the spice section of a grocery store.  Break the round head off, and put the stem in your mouth.  I carried those around for a long time.

  
"My dad quit after 50 years of smoking a pipe because he didn't want to hurt his grand kids.  I had asked him to stop smoking many times as I grew up but only when the grand kids came (and he was more emotionally mature) did he give up."I was hit by a car, and forced to quit whilst in the hospital.

I went from a can a day to three dips a day (after breakfast, lunch and dinner),then to none. Also while chewing straws while not dipping to satisfy the hand-mouth habit. 


Illness- the second time I quit long term was at 24-25. I got deathly sick with a flu and bronchitis double whammy one week and didn't smoke for about 3 years until I had a moment of weakness one day and picked them up.

Illness- the third and final time was in 2010 when I came back from bonnaroo with hepatitis c. I was sick for a week and couldtn smoke or eat anything.

As in put that cigarette out, toss out the rest of the pack, and be done. NOW. Not tomorrow, not next week, not when you're done with the pack (because its suuuuch a waste of money!), but immediately. That's always been true for me, and thats the only story I get from anyone I know that has successfully given up the habit. "Girlfriend "Exercise - I started running and doing weights a little while ago and noticed that if i had a smoke prior to that, I would be left frustrated with a bad performance at the gym... I decided that I liked running.""I was a smoker, then I was a closet smoker, then I was a chewer.  Nicotine had a hold of me pretty tight.  I was hiding it from my wife, and kids.  It was an addiction that was crazy.  I consider myself an honest man, but the guilt of this addiction made me feel like I was a fraud.

My wife knew that I was a smoker when we met.  I ""quit"".  Years later, she caught me smoking a few times and was wondering what else I was hiding from her.  Nothing, but I could not be trusted.  Time would go by and I would sneak a smoke every once in a while.  I chewed (as disgusting or more so than smoking)   She found a Skoal Bandit in my pocket when doing laundry.  She asked me if I was chewing, I told her yes.  She told me I needed to stop.  No judging, no guilt other than my own.

I quit making excuses on why I needed to chew/smoke. (This was the hardest part).  You don't need to smoke after you eat, drink, poo, wake-up, have a hard day, get stressed out, blah blah blah.  The only person you are fooling is yourself.  Chew gum lots of fucking gum.  I bought the 60 packs of Eclipse.  I chewed the shit out it, three pieces at a time.  I was an asshole for three weeks. My best friend hated me for those three weeks.  My wife and I fought for those three weeks.  I was the devil.

My integrity prevailed.  I am stronger than that stupid smelly habit.  I don't have to spit, I don't have to smell like an ashtray.  I don't chew gum all the time, and I am not an asshole.  I don't have to feel like a fraud.  I have not used nicotine for over 3 years.  My lungs are healthy, my mouth is healthy, and I can focus my time and energy on real issues.

Best of luck!20+ years basically chain smoking.  At the end I hated it. I enjoyed so little of it yet it controlled my life in ways non-addicted folks just can't understand.  I took Chantix and gnawed my way through quitting.  For you folks still smoking I can only tell you that quitting sucks ass but not smoking is fucking fantastic.  If I can be of any help to anyone trying to quit feel free to message me."After 14 years I looked into quitting.  I didn't want to take any drugs and didn't think that I could just quit cold turkey.  I decided to quit slowly over a long period of time.

I started out and didn't smoke any cigs until after 9:30 am every day going forward. I could have all the cigs I wanted after that designated time up until I went to bed.

The next month I moved the time up to 10:00 am and continued to smoke as much as I wanted as long as it was past 10:00 am.

Every month I would move it up either 30 minutes or an hour (depending on if I felt I could accomplish that goal or not). 

My body still CRAVED cigarettes, but it seemed easier to quit slowly this way.  I was still smoking, but also continued to restructure when my body craved the nicotine.    

It got to the point (sometime after I was at 11:30 am or noon) that I wouldn't even think about having them until that specific time that I designated (almost like an internal alarm).

Eventually, around 8 or 10 months, I worked my way up to 8:30 pm  Once that happened it was quite a bit easier to quit for good.

I would only smoke whenever I drank and I would literally chain smoke whenever I did. Oddly enough, smoking never really became a problem but every so often I'd get a craving for stoges the week after. That's when my brother bought me a vape for my birthday and honestly, it's much better than smokes. Tastes better, not as much nicotine and if you know what you're inhaling, less terrible chemicals in your lungs."A shitload of people in my family have had cancer and I figured it was best not to tempt fate anymore."I had smoked from the age of 17 to the age of 33. By the time I entered my 30s I hated my habit. I wanted to quit so bad and tried a lot of things, but nothing worked... Except a book. A book that was originally written many years ago. The best part about the book is that it encourages you to continue smoking as much as you want while you are reading it. In fact, if you finish the book and don't feel like quitting you can keep puffing away. It's called The Easyway To Quit Smoking by Allen Carr. You can buy it on Amazon with the kindle app for less than $10 bucks. It not only got me to quit, but at least 5 other friends who were hardcore. Good luck!

So I just stopped.  I'm not judging anyone here.  That's really just what did it for me. I put my stupid manly pride before it. "Maybe this should be in a throwaway, but I don't have that much karma.  I had been smoking for several years, about half a pack a day.  Tried quitting a few times, it would work for a week or two, and then something stressful happen and I would be back to smoking.  At the time, I was having an on again, off again relationship with this girl for two years.  Everytime we broke up, I would be back to smoking.  I was not for her.  She was not for me.  We were just dumb kids who thought we were.  She too smoke, but only socially.  One fight, she claimed that I was the reason she was smoking, I broke up with her.  Told myself that ""if you quit without her here.  You can prove that she caused you to smoke.""  It was extremely petty, and silly.  But it worked.  I quit smoking, and I never answered any more of her calls.""I caught pneumonia. For the third time. This time I couldn't smoke (and believe me, I tried LOL), I could barely breathe, so I decided to see if I could not smoke, And I did. And I kept doing it after I got well. That was about 15 years ago, & I haven't had a single cigarette since. But I have to admit, I don't think of myself as someone who quit, I think of myself more as a smoker who doesn't smoke because it sure smells good to me to this day. Unfortunately, this method is probably not at all helpful to you.

Coincidentally, I've kept a carton of cigarettes this entire time in case of an ""emergency"". Like the zombie apocalypse or something of that level where I figure I was going to die anyway, so I might as well start smoking again. Just this morning I was cleaning out a drawer, & decided to throw the carton away. It's sitting in the garbage pail next to my nightstand. I am aware of it. Really aware. :-) 

One more thing. If I had known how much weight I would gain once I stopped. I NEVER would have stopped.""I made a deal with myself that I can continue to enjoy nicotine gum for the rest of my life as long as I never light up another cigarette.  Currently I consume more (clean, fresh, pharmaceutical) nicotine in gum form than I ever did as a smoker.  But my breath is fresh and my dentist is happier.  

I was a hardcore smoker for more years than I care to admit.  I just really like nicotine.  It makes all the pleasure centers in my brain sing the hallelujah chorus.

Hey, no judging!""My vaporizer , havnt bought a pack since i got it 3 months ago :) give it a try ! ""I took [these](http://aptekagdanska.pl/upload/product_files/39041/6066_tabex-apteka-gdanska_.jpg) which has [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytisine) compound. It basicly makes nicotine repulsive to you. After maybe a week you will smell again how bad smoke stinks. And by stinks I mean holy shit! This smells bad! I was somking for +8years and I've only tried two times quitting. First attempt lasted 8 months - got into smoking because I thought it will help me relax and also most of my friends smokes so it was easy to get addicted again. Now on my second attempt somewhere in 7th or 8th month. Still want to somke but I realise that smoking was a function that I did for SEVERAL years, day by day, pack after pack, cig after cig. So I know it will be hard to drop that habit. So my tips are:

* DO NOT smoke electronic cig as a substitution for real one, as this will surely get you back to smoking real ones

* DO NOT use nicotine based gums, adhesive tape, spray or whatever. The point is to not have any nicotine!

* Sadly your social life has to take some damage - smoking is as I like to call it social drug. So you have to cut down your meetings with friends that smoke or tell them not to smoke around you(this won't work mostly). Also avoid parties if you can as getting drunk almost always ends in smoking in early and late stages.

* If you don't work out, now is great time to start

* avoid things that remind you of smoking, like on your break you go outside on that bench to smoke, well now you avoid that bench like its your mother in law.

* motivation is the key to successes you have to WANT to quite smoking if you do not truly want - you will fail!

* do not try quitting in pairs i.e. with your SO, brother, mother, friend or your dog if you do - you will fail!

* A big help would be someone who already quitted somking and could help you in times of need to keep you motivated.

* Do you realise that you don't have control over this? Like you know that smoking is bad and yet you still do it? How is that possible since you are so proud? You make your life and yet you can't say no? To a thing that slowly kills you? How is that not pathetic? Get yourself togheter and do it now! Do not wait, do not say this is my last, tomorrow, after this is over. NO! You want to know if you can quit? Do it now - if you can't, then you won't.

Over years had a few botched attempts to quit some times I'd go a month or so but then slide back to 'just the one'.. Never smoked in the house so it was always a work thing. Allen Carr book helped both longer term quits before the slide.. Back surgery also sorted a long period of no cigs. But this time it was cold turkey and cost... 2 kids I don't want to stink and its like å£8+ a pack in UK...

2 Years clear... still fancy one like ;)""Haven't smoked in one month exactly.  Happy new year.  I'm 24 years old.
Only one other time in ten years have I gone this long without smoking - last year, I actually did two months and what I did was ""just smoke the least I can every day"".  This slowly became fewer and fewer cigarettes.  The logic here is that even if you never ""quit smoking"", the LESS you smoke the better your health (And, bonus - the less you smoke the less you'll want to smoke), so why not try and have better and better health as a smoker that *may or may not* one day be a non-smoker.  Imagine if you smoked two cigarettes a day for your whole life.  That's not most ideal, but fuck, it's a hell of a lot better than 20 or 10 or 5, and if cold turkey isn't working then it's something to consider.  

I can't tell you how bad I want one just even typing about it.  It's bad.  Shit, someone on the TV just smoked.  It's even worrrrse.  It's so bad, in fact, that I would surely smoke right now if it weren't for the fact that *I can't  - or I will put my good standing at my job in jeopardy*.
I am a live-in nanny, and I said on my application I would not smoke.  The smell of smoke carries.  When I taught preschool, although technically I could smoke I just (obviously) couldn't smoke on the job, I still never did, without taking a shower first, because my work as an early childhood educator is so important to me.

That being said, if I knew I could smoke and not ""get caught"" (sneak in at night wash all my clothes and the sheets the next day?), I probably would once in a while.  

Dating a non-smoker also helps.  And having smoker friends (and especially DRINKING with those friends) is just about the biggest roadbloack there is.

Fuckin' hell.  Picking up smoking is the single worst decision I ever made in my life.  Such a waste of money and health.

Another thing to remember while quitting is that smoking a little once in a while isn't the end of the world.  Yeah, I've gone a month without smoking.  Will I ever go a year?  Maybe, but I doubt it, and that's okay.  I wouldn't have that much more pride anyways in the long run.  If I smoke the equivalent of a pack in one year, what the fuck difference does it make as opposed to 0 cigarettes?  Not much.  Not much at all.  Smoking that infrequently I would still consider myself a ""non smoker"".

P.S. I was going to read more into people's responses on this thread but three replies down and I want a cigarette so bad that I.just.can't."Not drinking.when you realize you love yourself more then cigarettes its easy."I spent a December in St. Paul, MN. It was so cold (-15F pretty much the whole time) I could never go outside to smoke. Quit cold turkey pretty by accident due to the circumstance."One month before quitting I hyper focused on what I was about to do. And I quit cold turkey no gum no pills nothing. At the 3 month mark when most people give in to temptation something happened in my brain. That just the smell of a cigarette  from 5 feet away left a burning smell in my nose so bad that I had to get away from it that lasted about a year. So I was very lucky and it's been 6 1/2 years since my last one."I just recently quit and have been going strong for 2 months. What really helped me was reminding myself how important my health is. I'm only 24 and was starting to feel like an old woman. Another thing that helped me was reducing the stress in my life so even when I craved one it wasn't one of those turn into the hulk kind of cravings. I've had a lot of health issues for most of my life, so it was just really important to remember that whenever I craved one. Everyone is different though, maybe you have kids, maybe you want to start working out, or just be healthier in general, just never let yourself forget why you're quitting. I even made a little list of things I told myself every time I craved a smoke and it really helped. Good Luck!""Stopped after 20 years of heavy smoking (up to 2 packs/day). 
How? By stopping doing it. 

I'm lazy by nature, so I figured not doing something must be less work than doing something. Therefore not smoking must be less work than smoking.

That night we were sitting around a campfire and got on the topic of our grandparents deaths from lung cancer.  I through my cigarette in the fire and quit that day.  Everyone around me still smokes to include that buddy, but I've stayed the course.  

The reality is I had to tell myself in that moment that I was done smoking, period.  No weaning off it, just stopping.  I'm not perfect, I've had a cigarette here and there when drinking, but I've not bought cigarettes since.  

It's tough no matter what route you choose, you just have to choose a route that works for you and see it through.  You won't find some magical trick.  "I need a cigarette now >.<"For me it was a combo of two things. The first was me being mentally ready and willing to quit.  The second was Allen Carr's book The Easy Way to Stop Smoking.  I had no idea that a book could tell me not to smoke and I would listen.  He breaks it down and after I was halfway done with the book I was a non smoker. The way I feel the book worked is it literally brainwashed me out of wanting to smoke.  It pointed out all of the societal triggers and random encouragements that there are to smoke and then showed all of the flaws. There were a couple of other small things that really hit home for me like pointing out that when in a movie theater or on a plane or a place where smoking is not accepted you kind of just accept it and deal with it for however many hours without a problem(most people anyways). Another problem that I thought I would have was worrying about what to do with my hands but he pointed out that people who dont smoke dont have that problem.  They just let their hands be natural.  Since I didnt know what natural was it was a scary thought, but it made sense. The hardest thing to overcome was drinking and smoking.  My true test was superbowl of 2013.  At that point I had not had a cigarette in just about two weeks and was doing ok but had not gone out drinking yet.  Well superbowl is get drunk, watch football, and chain smoke cigarettes with my friends time.  I knew that if I could be drinking and not have a cigarette with my friends and nearly have a heart attack while watching my 9ers try and make their comeback I would be all good.  My 9ers lost, I was drunk and mad as shit but still didnt have a smoke.  From then on it was game over, no more smokes for this young buck.
  It has been 1 year and 27 days since I have had a cigarette and I couldn't be happier. ""I quit four years ago (I used to smoke about 20 cigarettes a day for more than 10 years). No electronic cigarette, not nicotine patches, nothing. The only thing you need is to be convinced that you want to quit. If you're not sure, you'll begun to excuse yourself ""Well, it doesn't matter if I smoke when I'm drunk with friends"", ""Well, I guess the only way to know if I've really over it is to smoke one..."". Be honest with yourself. Don't try to annoy people around you waiting until they give you permission: ""Smoke a fucking cigarette and leave us alone!"". If you really want to quit, you'll do it.

You have to scroll down to get the full version.""This will probably sound like BS to a lot of people, but for me, the only thing that worked was hypnotherapy. I had already tried the nicotine inhaler thing, the chewing gum, and the e-ciggs. None of them worked.

Saw a special offer for hypnotherapy for smokers and said ""fuck it"" and booked an appointment.

It was weird man, I always thought hypnosis would be all you zone out and all of a sudden someone snaps a finger and you've lost 20 minutes of your life and with a bit of luck, your bodily cavities don't hurt.

It was nothing like that though, it was more so like meditation. I was completely aware for the entire time, even thinking to myself on several occasions ""this is bullshit no way will this work"", and my mind wandered several times to things like ""oh my feet should probably be flat on the floor, my hands are touching, they shouldn't be touching I bet"".

Still, on the 18th of Feb this year, I will have been smoke free for a year. I didn't touch a single cigarette since the evening I had the hypnotherapy session. I haven't had a single craving since either.

The hardest part was the boredom and sheer muscle memory from stepping outside and immediately reaching for my pocket to grab a smoke for the first week or so. The rest was effortless.""This may seem simple or even silly, but be public about it. When you make your decision to quit, tell your friends and family, post it on your social network, whatever. Not only will this help you build a support system, but it's a way to encourage yourself to conquer your goal and prove to your family and peers that you can beat it. Good luck."I like this.

I choice a week where I knew I had no important meetings or things I needed to be sharp for (I was a student at the time) and just quit cold turkey, I chewed regular non-sugar gum a lot tho.. I had to occupy my mouth with something, gum and lollipops.
It was truly brutal, so many times I just wanted to say fuck it and end the pain but If I made it into a challenge, if I can get through this week it'l get slightly easier each day until it's gone was my thinking.

When I was 15, I worked for the summer at construction, picked up heavily there(before that just at weekends with friends), smoked a pack every 2 days for a year. Then casually stopped for a year.

After a year we organised -i dont know how to explain this- a show for the freshman in our high school(tradition in our country[Romania]). It was stressfull and I smoked again, quit for a few months after the show. Got back into it at university. Now at 3rd year of university, since january 11 I casually stopped smoking, since then I had smoken 2 cigarettes offered by my classmate while we were drinking coffee.

Maybe it's just me, but I allways felt like cigarettes for me were like chocolates for other people. When I had I could hardly stop smoking them, when I had not it was like meh."Pregnancy. "I never planned on quitting. What happened was that I started to observe my smoking habit, specifically what my triggers for craving a cigarette were. I noticed that often all it would take was seeing someone light up a smoke for me to want to have one as well. Slowly, that really started to piss me off. I'd realize that I would hate the fact the fact that I'd succumbed to the trigger and lit up a smoke. triggers varied from having a coffee, to having a drink, to seeing someone smoke, to being bored. i watched myself for about six months.

Then one afternoon, after a night of partying, I bummed a smoke off my friend, because I'd finished mine. I smoked the cigarette, butted it out and declared ""that's it. I'm done. That was my last cigarette"". She laughed and said ""yeah right! I didn't know you were thinking of quitting."" ""I wasn't, I just decided it now. I'm done.""

I have not touched, nor craved cigarettes since.  It's been 12 years. ""I had been sneaking cigarettes at work for years, back when you could smoke at your desk, etc.   I came home smelling like smoke all the time, so it wasn't that unusual.  I tried quitting a few times and sometimes, made it a year.

One day, I came home and my (now deceased) wife said ""You've been smoking at work, right?"".  I said, ""Yeah, ...I have.""   She said ""Well, cut it out.""

That was it.  I just stopped.  That was 30 years ago.

I decided, on some kind of cellular level, that I was going to be in charge of myself.  Not some asshole in Winston-Salem, NC.  Me.  The adult in my body.  

Quit drinking the same way.  Made an honest assessment of the costs and benefits and booze lost.

Growing up is some hard shit, dude.   If you are slave to substances, you are not there, yet.  

So, I'm telling you... cut it out. Just quit.  Quit making excuses and just be bigger than the problem.  Throw your decision switch and quit making that decision every day.  You only need to quit ONCE.  Do it.
""A complete change of lifestyle - I was working in one of the leading internet providers in my country where I had a stressfull job working on one of the companies biggest projects, especially through the planning and development stage. This caused a lack of sleep and an increase of stress and my smoking increased where I was pretty much a pack-a-day smoker. Which in my country is expensive.

So yes my trigger was pretty much just like yours. Work + Stress + Lack of sleep = SMOKE.

What fixed this was my having a change in my life. I decided to leave my various jobs and go to university to get a degree in something completely unrelated to IT. That was half way through 2012 and I have had many things change in my life through that year, dropping a smoking habit was one. Really it just went down to cold turkey for me, but thats because I like to do things the hard way.

I had made a few attempts to quit over the years, the longest stretch being 2 months.  I can say this with certainty, you will not quit unless youre ready to quit.

The way I did it was one day while still smoking, I had one of those times where the cig made me feel like shit (had smoked too much) and I was feeling disgusted with the whole thing.  So, at that exact moment, I engrained into my brain those thoughts and feelings.  Then I quit.  Once I stopped I would go through the typical yearnings, but this time instead of having that typical internal conflict about buying ""just one more pack"", I would recall my thoughts and feelings from that one moment, telling myself ""smoking has done nothing positive for you, and it makes you feel like shit and stink"".  I had to do this tons of times to make it out of the first month, but it worked.  I never thought id ever stop smoking because just like any other smoker out there, I loved smoking.

You just have to want it enough and realize you're going to suffer for a little while. Realizing how energetic and less apathetic you end up is the biggest reason to want it though.

I've always had respiratory issues and allergies that smoking never helped -- but that didn't stop me smoking at least a pack a day for close to ten years.

Then I stayed dating this girl who just passively one day said the following ""I wish you wouldn't do that. I want the EyeLikeThis to live as many years as possible.""

All in all you have to come to the realization that each cigarette is unfair to those you love. I could care less about living longer our not but when my gf said that to me I saw how selfish and uncaring it was to those I loved and cared for.

TLDR: Come to the conclusion within yourself that you ore it to your loved ones to give your full devotion in life and that includes living add long as you can. "Will power! "I switched to Natural American Spirits. Seriously. They are without the additives in Marbs and such, which is what you're really addicted to. So I smoked spirits for about 6 months and during that time my body became weened off the chems. I could tell it was happening too, after a cig I felt like I still needed one but I knew I just had smoked. 

Once the chemical addiction is gone, then it's just a matter of not buying them anymore. Was super easy to do and I rarely had cravings. That's because I was still smoking while I kicked the addiction. I even emailed the American Spirit company telling them they should market their cigs that way, but they said they had their own marketing crew thanks very much. 

Good luck. "Champix. I was hardcore too."All you need is the genuine desire to no longer smoke.  For real.  I've watched many people quit and start again, knowing they will fail beforehand. 

I smoked for 15yrs, quit twice for a few months each.  Every time I would slowly start smoking again.  After that I never bothered trying to quit because I knew I was quitting for money, family, health, or some other reason.  Eventually I lost the desire to smoke, so quitting was as easy as not buying any more smokes. 

I hate to sound pessimistic, but I think for most people, trying to quit without the internal motivation is just setting yourself up for failure. Patches, gum, pills.......they don't mean shit if you don't truly want to stop. "I started exercising. It also helped that my parents made me smoke outside and it was cold as hell during that time.I smoked for a little over 10 years. I quit several times but quitting cold turkey was the only method that worked. You need to really want to quit and to have a logical mindset about things. The first few days are the hardest so what I did was consider the living hell I went through during those first few days and how foolish it would be for me to throw that all away by lighting another cigarette. The duration of cravings is very small but that doesn't mean that you can't have back to back cravings either. You just gotta be able to ignore them. I haven't smoked in about 6 or 7 years now I believe and I don't have cravings at all anymore. Nicotine chewing gum and will power "My girlfriend really. She said it was either the ""cigarettes"" or her"how on earth could you leave a person who you are in love with for such a reason? Hope your relationship wil last."It's a two stage process:  first, you quit being a massive pussy. Second, you quit smoking.""I caught bronchitis and was unable to smoke for 10 days because I felt like crap. When I felt better, I realized cigarette smoke stinks. 10/10 would flu again. "E-cigs. The downside is I'm semi-addicted to it. But the upside is that it made me realize how gross cigarettes taste and feel. Even when I'm drunk I don't want to smoke. I'm working down on cutting down on the e-cigs. I'm going to go cold turkey soon. "I found chantix helpful. Stopped smoking for a little over a year. Have tried gum, patches, you name it. But what REALLY WORKED was facing the reality that I'd never be able to breathe normally again and that I'd die. I was born with degenerative lungs so smoking didn't help. But for me, having a true epiphany on wanting to live did the trick for me.""First, forget all these nicotine substitutes.

Look at the cigarette butt after you finish one. The fact that it's stained shows that plenty is still going into your lungs. Imagine what made it into your lungs from that cigarette. From the cigs you had today, this week, month, year, etc.


Think about how bad they taste. Imagine that bad taste in all it's bleh, disgusting, glory. Imagine yourself taking that hit that just tastes terrible, makes your tongue feel blech, scratches your throat, leaves a bad aftertaste, just smells bad!


Imagine how each one of these things you smoke is shortening the time you get to spend experiencing the things you love, the people you love by, say, 5 seconds. How many did you have today? this month? this year? in your life?


Ask yourself, Are these things worth forever permanently losing *insert things you love here*?


Anyways, you get what I'm saying. Come up with your own. Create extremely vivid thoughts/answers to these questions, especially involving smell and taste as those bring about the strongest memories. 

Every. Single. Time. You have that nicotine urge, pick one or more of these thoughts/questions and think about it in full, living color. Keep doing this and eventually you will rewire your brain and it's currently conditioned response to something more beneficial.


This is a good technique for any rewiring of the brain you wish to do. It really isn't that hard to learn how to rewire your own brains thinking patterns. I have used it for decades to reprogram incorrect thinking/responses.""My family was friends with another one who had a baby girl born the same time as myself. We remained friends, but lived at other sides of the world due to careers and family choices. 
At my ""our"" thirties birthday I received an invite with an air ticket to the city where my girlfriend and her family lived. Surprise she was in hospital age 30 with lung and throat cancer looking like 75 and weighing less than 40kg. I was so shocked when I saw her. When I left the hospitals I threw my cigarettes in the trash gave my, yes ""Dupont"" lighter to the limo driver who was smoking while waiting as I returned. And I never felt the urge to smoke again ever not an hour not a day later the vice was gone 100% and I have never smoked again in near 30 years. Unfortunatly as you may expect my friend died a few days later but I see her face in many I look at who are smoking. I think possibly a way to treat people is tho give them an 3D illusion what they would look like at a similar state like my friend so that images gets engraved in their mind. I guess it would be expensive but worth it an better than all the other ""replacements"" that are still filled with nicotine.  ""Nicotine patches and this app on my phone called Quit Now.  Nidoderm cq, not the cheap ass off brand ones( they fall off.)  I failed the first time around because I didn't follow the instructions.  You have to keep using the patches even though you feel like you don't need to. I was a 2 pack a day or more smoker and the patches worked great for getting me stop.  The app keeps me off them.  The keeps track of how many cigarettes you would've smoked, how much time you would've spent smoking and how much money you've saved.  I just celebrated 3 years of not smoking earlier this week and I have saved over $12,000 in that time.  I still want cigarettes but I won't ever start again.""Easy-- got a new boyfriend, new car, moved to a new apartment in a new city 628 miles away, a whole set of new friends, and a new job. Haven't smoked since.""Sorry, late to the show, but this is important:

a) Cliche, but first and foremost, *want* to quit.  For health, girlfriend, whatever

b) Pick a crutch, anything, obviously, other than smoking.  Exercise, art, sex, nicotine gum, Chantix, Bupropion (antidepressant, this is what I've used, multiple times)

c) Don't get discouraged with failure (I've quit multiple times, but I ""requit"" after a short while).

d) Tell everybody you're quitting.  The more obnoxious and aggressive the friends/family the better (they'll help keep you honest).""1 year ago. Boyfriend got tongue cancer (we were 32). Dentist had found leukoplakia, which led to a biopsy of his tongue. Biopsy was supposed to last 20 minutes. Three+ hours later, the doctor comes out and tells me that he'd found cancerous cells and removed what he thought was necessary. Boyfriend's tongue was still intact, but he was missing a fairly large chunk of his tongue near the back.  Recovery was hell. It's hard for us non - medical people to know how much oral hemorrhaging is too much. Beyond painful to watch someone you love writhing in pain while maxed out on Dilauded (it's a useless drug, FYI). Turns out that the margins weren't clean. Cancer was still there. Day after surgery, I woke at 5 am. Smelled smoke. Asshole was smoking. I did what any loving woman would do to a drugged up moron. I gave him an extra dose of Dilauded, along with benadryl, and after he passed out, I put the patch on him. It took him nearly a week to realize he'd quit smoking. 

He's not cancer-free, but it's a slow moving cancer that they won't treat until it's actually threatening. We wait and wonder when/if it'll be a invasive. In the meantime, he quit without knowing, and I quit because I couldn't bear the thought of scaring my family the way I was after that diagnosis. 

TL;DR bf has cancer, I drugged him and put him on the patch. Made jokes about how he could one day kiss me while tounging me with his detachable, plastic tongue.. ""I started smoking around age 14 and finally quit about a year ago (I'm 24 now). I tried to quit at various times, for different time spans. Usually the main reason for quitting was because although I enjoyed smoking I knew it was bad for my health and so I thought I had to quit eventually. Most notably was when I found out I had cancer right before I turned 21. After that I decided I definitely had to quit, what kind of idiot would still smoke after having cancer. I did treatments; Chemo, etc. and continued not smoking. Then one day, I think mostly out of boredom and a little depression, I decided fuck it I still like smoking and BAM smoker again just like that. By this time I was 22 and it wasn't until about a year later that I finally decided I WANTED to quit, I didn't HAVE to. At that point I mostly stopped enjoying them and this is when I finally quit smoking cigarettes. To this day I'll light one up if I get real boozy (not proud of it) but I never continue to smoke the next day because deep down I don't want to anymore.""Ok, so here are my bullet points on smoking cessation:

Quitting is a series of failures. You will fail several times. Try not to let the guilt get you down.

Quitting is easiest during a change of scenery where your typical routines are disrupted. Vacation works really well for this.

Distraction is key. Have things to do. Things that involve your hands. learn a new hobby. When you can't devote your full attention to something, but having something in your hand to play with helps. I'll twiddle a heavy-ish pen or rod of some sort with my left hand while reading or watching something.

Have something for your mouth to do. Sugar-free gum or candy are an option, but take it easy. Too much of certain non-sugar sweeteners can anger your bowels.

Quit cold turkey. People will disagree with me, but I've never been able to taper off. Suck it up and do all your suffering at once.

Most importantly, don't quit until you're ready. If you half-ass it, you will fail, and you don't need any more guilt in your life."It started when I was looking to save money so I switched to an electronic/vapor cigarette. Then after so long on that I was just turned off to the idea of real smoke that I didnt even want to anymore. After awhile I I got bored with it and quit that altogether. The only time ill have a cigarette now is maybe 1 cig a month with a close friend of mine. If that."E CIGARETTES. its all the joys of smoking, without all the harmful consequences."I used to smoke a pack a day for a year then suddenly one day they started to taste nasty and I haven't been able to even be around them at all since"Not cigarettes, but another quit using another nicotine product. Basically: working out and eating food.""I know this is an old thread, but if you're still reading answers -- I quit or tried to quit probably 5-10 times before actually being successful.  I even managed to quit for a year one time before some crisis got me to start up again.  The last 2 times I quit, I used the patch but I only used it for a couple of weeks, and then weaned myself off of it.  I smoked for about 10 years.  I've been smoke free for about that long as well.  I had to also make sure I didn't go to my usual smoking areas, because that would set off intense cravings.  I just did something else.  Went for a 5- minute walk or whatever.  Good luck; the urge to smoke will pass whether or not you smoke.  ""Combination of really wanting to quit and an e cig plus moral support to get through the rough beginning. It wasn't fun but worth that shitty shitty two weeks. After 2weeks I threw the e cig away and started replacing with over habits.

The will to actually, for real this time, I'm serious I'm getting old, want to quit plus feeling like crap every morning did it for me."So? Were you able to stop smoking? You should provide an update in your original question.Thank you for asking. :) I'll do an edit: update."Really late for this thread but here it goes. It's my lungs.During my college days, I used to smoke around 2 packs a day. Got hospitalized because of severe asthma and they had to inject me with 20cc's of steroids, but that that didn't do anything so I got confined for a week. This made me stop for a year because that was just a pain to go through. Then I started smoking again, but this time it was just around 2 - 4 sticks a day. Then just 2 weeks ago, I got hospitalized again. Same issue same everything. And now I haven't been smoking since. The things that made me stop is not because of the hassle of getting hospitalized, but the cost of getting hospitalized. My health card doesn't really cover much of the expenses when getting hospitalized. Plus the meds are really expensive. All of this matter now because I'm getting married soon and I'd rather save money than use it to buy some packs. ""I'm a little late to this party but I couldn't resist posting on this topic. After numerous attempts and a one month stint only to be overcome by stupid excuses, I was finally able to quit by using one of those disposable e-cigs. I was a menthol smoker so I needed to feel that coolness on the back of my thought when I took a drag. I used the Blu disposable and had the rechargeable pack. There is no way I could of done it without those. (I will say that going out drinking helped). With the e-cig I was able to take a hit when I needed it without feeling like I had to smoke an entire smoke. I could take a few hits and stop. Slowly i needed less drags when i wanted one and the time between them expanded. I was even able to make it through a bachelor party in Vegas with a bunch of people that did smoke. With the e-cig I felt safe knowing that I had something if I needed it so I couldn't talk myself into buying a pack ""just in case"". Its been a little over 2 years and I haven't even had one drag. The want will never go away. The smell will still be so nice (not the morning stale smoke smell but a freshly lit smoke). Good luck. before you know it you will feel so good that you will actually know what feeling sick is and why people act like babies when they are sick"I floss my teeth a shitload"I tried ""cutting back"" so many times and failed over and over again. All it finally took for me (being the stubborn bastard I am) was for my now ex-gf to tell me ""you'll never actually quit"".

I didn't even 'want' to quit cigarettes. They were working fairly well to temper my severe anxiety and ease a bit of the depression (nicotine is highly serotonergic). But I'm now one month into my wellbutrin, and even the mere thought of a cigarette disgusts me. Bupropion is a nicotinic agonist which means that it not only replaces your body's craving for nicotine, but also prevents you from achieving any pleasure from smoking. Cigarette smoke literally smells like burning paper now. Cigarettes taste like plant matter dipped in formaldehyde (which I guess isn't too far off from what they actually are). This shit works, sometimes even regrettably. I almost miss the pleasure of smoking. The ability to 'pause' life for a few seconds every day on my patio, the ice breaker at the bar. I was in love with cigarettes, and while Wellbutrin made me see how ugly they were, I still reminisce about them.""I came here looking for wellbutrin and Im surprised it isnt a more common answer. I take it as an anti-depressant, and for the first few days I lost my appetite and didnt sleep as well, but after that I didnt experience any bad side effects at all. I love my wellbutrin.

2) Got a gym membership.

3) Stopped smoking one day because of cold.

4) Realized 3 days later that I hadn't had a cigarette.

5) Thought about smoking, went to gym instead.  Eliptical'd the fuck out til I was tired and wobbly.

For the first few weeks you can smoke as much and as often as you like, except during class.

Eventually we had to smoke using our ""other hand,"" and then the other hand using different fingers, and then not until 15 minutes after eating and then not while on the phone, and not while drinking coffee, and then not while driving etc. Basically they slowly ween you off all the standard triggers that are associated with lighting up.

Then, one day I noticed I had not had a cigarette in about two hours and just decided ""that's it. I'm done."" I didn't drag out the last cigarette in some big ceremony I could dwell on that would only make me miss it more, I just didn't smoke again.
Also, I had about a quarter of a pack left when I did this. This was important to me as well, because I then knew it wasn't my inability to quickly access cigarettes that was preventing me from smoking, but my own sheer force of will! I could pick one up, hold it, and say ""I'm not going to smoke you.""

I just chewed lots and lots and lots and lots of gum.  "I quit many times but eventually I did. Cold turkey. And at a low time in my life too. I knew having a bad time was no excuse and I just quit. Don't try to say goodbuy to a good friend because after a while you don't miss it that much anymore. You'll really apreciate the air you have and your smell. When you have a difficult moment just tell yourself I wont have one now, perhaps after an hour. Then you say the same thing when it hits you again. Not today, perhaps tomorrow..."Chantix is good stuff! It is how I quit. Its been 6 years since my last cigarette.  I also had really good dreams that were very vivid while on it."Cold Turkey. 
Start in the morning. 

Make sure you finish your pack in the evening before you go to bed. 

When you wake up you will usually feel horrible, coughing, hacking etc. 

So this is the best time to start. 

Then just suffer through it. 

Things are better now than when I quit. 

You have vaporizers and patches and gum and everything that can help but the thing is just don't buy it. Mind over Matter. 

It's hard. 

The first 3 days are horrible. 

After that it's not THAT bad. 

But being honest, it was a good two full years before I felt like I not only didn't want a cigarette but I began to hate them.

It's possible, you can do it. If I can do it anyone can.  ""Probably not what you want to hear and I am sorry if a might sound cocky, but the only way to quit smoking is to DO it instead of TRYING to do it.

""What really helped me out was purchasing an electronic cigarette. At first I tried those cheap gimmicky ones that you can pick up at any gas station, and they were just gross. I always went back for another pack of smokes when I got one of those.

However, it wasn't until I found pen vaporizers that I really started to manage to cut down on cigarettes. You can find one [here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/E-go-C4-Electronic-Vaporizer-More-Vapor-Starter-Kit-1100-mAh-WHITE-/271374406573?pt=US_Cigarettes&hash=item3f2f2cd3ad). 

This one is a cheap version. The idea is to buy this and an atomizer (note the kit comes with both the battery and the clearomizer for your e-liquid) and fill it with e-liquid of your choice of flavor and nicotine concentratrions. 

For me, I roll with 70pg and 30 vg. The vegetable glycerin contains most of the sweet flavors and pg is just a supplement to help prolong the life of your atomizer. Also, the flavor range for these things is ridiculous in scope. You can get cotton candy, melon, blueberry, redbull, the flavors are endless, and delicious.

I have been a smoker for 13 years, and this was the thing that got me off of it. In addition, you may also get dry herb vaporizer cartridge, and even a wax burner cartridge. Some do both herb vape and wax burning, but those are meant for adjustable voltage pens.

I really recommend any smoker to get one of these.""czech this out, this website is generally much cheaper, and this is a better quality one.

Ive slipped here and there when drunk, but other than that, it worked, and I haven't looked back.

Bonus: you can chew the gum at work, thus rockin a nicotine buzz at work, wasn't the worst thing ever!""I used one month of Chantix. I kept an eye on myself and asked my closest family and friends to let me know if I began to act like a lunatic. I did NOT set a quit date (that kind of pressure would cause me to fail before) and I just smoked until I didn't want them anymore. I used to smoke A-LOT - like almost a pack a day, menthol lights. So after two weeks I didn't want them anymore, stopped smoking and was able to remain on the medicine for another two weeks, which helped a great deal. One bit of advice, WEEN YOURSELF OFF of it. Even if you only go from a full pill to a half a couple of times. This will help your body adjust to lower/eventually no dosages. Talk to your doctor. This really helped me. I was a smoker of over 5 years. ""Not buying cigarettes, mostly."Chantix..hands down!"Chantix helped me... Better quitting through brain chemistry.  

I agree, cold turkey is the way to go, Nicotine replacement is a sucker's game. ""I used patches exactly as directed and started working out A LOT. Like 5 days a week working out. I had previously been a five time loser in quitting, so I really really wanted it this time. 

I believe those three things with commitment to quitting being the biggest is what got me to success. 

Good luck. ""I was never a heavy smoker (half-pack a day tops) but I was able to quit on my 4th or 5th time going cold turkey. I have 2 pieces of advice. First, don't pick a day to stop. Just stop now. Don't have a ""last cigarette"". That's going into it with the wrong attitude. When you're looking back you should be focused on the firmness of your resolve when you made the decision, not on how much you enjoyed your last smoke.  Second, stay sober for a few weeks at least. I think every time I failed it was because one of my friends lit up when I was a few drinks in. Maybe pick up a book or reward yourself with a new video game. Just something to keep yourself from getting bored when you're not smoking or drinking in the evenings. Try to keep in mind that the cravings WILL pass and you'll feel really good about yourself when you've done it. Not only because of money/health but because you've achieved something that's truly difficult to do.""Quit cold turkey and start running. That way, if you slip up, you'll feel it. Hard. And you'll be getting in better shape, ya know, from the running."My father quit when me and my siblings were very young. He decided on quitting the day he couldn't afford both a pack of cigarettes and milk for his kids. He chose the later and hasn't smoked since. "What got me to quit was literally feeling sick every time I smoked. I wanted to vomit. So, I switched to e-cigs. I can only assume you're using something like Blu or other cigalike. Cigalikes were wholly unsatisfying for me, and I luckily found /r/electronic_cigarette. Go there; people will help you find a decent beginner's setup to start with.""I've been off of them for awhile now.  What has really helped me is just replacing it with a more healthy alternative.  I ran a half marathon back on Thanksgiving and have been running consistently since.  The lung capacity is awesome.  I really enjoy being able to breathe better!  The biggest thing is really wanting to quit. You HAVE to WANT to do it.  Just like I've read over a dozen times on this thread.  People just quit. I did. So can you!  You gotta want it though! Cigarettes are a hell of an addiction. But you can beat it because you're more powerful than it.  

Another thing that really helped me was comparing it to paying someone to kill me slowly.  You wouldn't pay someone to torture you slowly daily would you? Well you are whenever you waste money on cigarettes.  

A big one is knowing your triggers.  For me alcohol is a huge one so I have been abstaining from that.  It sucks.  But comparing it to cancer it's a no brainer! 

You can do it!! STAY STRONG!!!!""I've tried and failed maybe 6 or 7 times over the past 4 years. I loved smoking too much. I started to feel some pain in my lungs, and that was enough to push me to suddenly stop one day, cold turkey.

I didn't plan it out, I didn't say ""ok, i'm going to quit tomorrow or after this last pack."" I simply had a random urge to just stop one evening and never turned back. Sort of like when Forrest Gump was doing his marathon and suddenly he decided to call it a day for no reason. After 6 months off of cigs, I think I've completely kicked it. I get no cravings whatsoever.

It was very hard initially and as expected. I kept myself busy by reading. Sometimes I had to struggle to keep myself focused on reading rather than going out for another break.

I believe that everyone quits for their own reasons. I've tried to quit so that I could play sports better, so that I would smell better, so that I'd save money, etc. None of that worked. What finally gave me the determination was accepting that 'hey...my lungs are hurting. I really could suffer a painful early death from this! I really don't want to die yet!""

""Just quit, you fucking pussy.

Did that help?""I said to myself, 'I will never ever smoke another cigarette in my life,"" then went on the patch for 2 weeks, while avoiding my common triggers such as socializing, and coffee.  After 2 weeks, I knew the physical addiction was over, it was just the habit, so slowly I introduced my other activities like drinking coffee without cigs, or going out without cigs.  I knew if I could quit smoking, I could do anything.  It is by far the hardest thing I had done until then.  Since then the hardest things are challenging myself to move across the country, travel solo, and meet many fitness goals.  It's been 12 years, never smoked.  The ONLY WAY to quit is to never ever smoke again, because you'll be right back to square one the minute you bum a smoke from someone."Contemplating my mortality helped."In order to quit smoking, you must first not smoke anymore cigarettes. Pretty simple."I started dipping. C'mon /r/dippingtobacco back me up on this one.I stopped lighting cigarettes on fire and putting them in my face.I tried not being a fucking pussy.I ran out of weed. "I didn't smoke, but my girlfriend did.  She downloaded an app on her iphone that counts how many days she's gone, and what benefits she's gaining as the days go on.  Each goal got farther and farther, (2 weeks quit, now your lungs are almost regenerating blah blah blah) then the next one would be like 6 months later.  By then she had totally forgotten about smoking and always likes to check the app and see how much $ she's saved from it and how many smokes she WOULD have smoked.  I think it's a great visual representation for people.""The flu, one hell of a dose of it too, cigarettes tasted like literally smoking shit and the taste would stay the whole day and more when I coughed up the smoke filled phlegm. After a 2 weeks of dealing with it and not smoking, I realized I had quit and never looked back.

I don't know where you can find flu in a bottle for sale but if you do, that's the ticket. ""Ecigs FTW! 

15-year smoker, *easily* quit with ecigs. ""Back story: had asthma as a kid until I was about 8. For some unexplained reason I stopped having any symptoms after 8. I picked up smoking at 17, (habituality anyways, I had tried it before this) I smoked, asthma symptom free until I was 29. Then the asthma suddenly came back. Not being able to breathe will make u stop. ""One word: Wife. I knew she wouldn't marry me if I kept smoking, so I quit. Before that, I had tried at least five times and it never took. Unsolicited advice: treat smoking as a serious addiction. Take it day by day and recognize that if you backslide, even one cigarette, you're throwing all your progress out the window and starting again at square one. Each day gets a little easier - after three days, your body is no longer hooked on nicotine, it's all in your head. It's a mind game, pure and simple.""I just started smoking more weed, and stopped smoking tobacco... on weed you cant really get addicted so .... that's it problem solved."oxcarbazepineAcid"I know it probably won't count to a lot of people here, but i haven't quit, i just never was a heavy smoker to begin with. I've always treated smoking like i treat drinking. It's not something i do on a daily basis, but i'll go out on weekends and ill drink, and i'll likely smoke. I don't smoke cig after cig, in the same way i dont drink shot after shot. Everything in moderation i guess. When I stopped feeling guilty about having a boge every once in awhile, i stopped feeling the pressure of having to define myself as a smoker/non-smoker. 

It seems odd, but the without the idea of craving something I shouldn't have, as opposed to occasionally wanting something i'm okay with having, it makes moderation super easy. I'll have maybe 1-2 cigarettes a week, (mainly weekends), and i simply don't crave them during the weekdays (with the exception of times of significant stress). Been this way for around 3 years now.

I know no cigarettes are better than some cigarettes, but then again, technically, no alcohol is better than some alcohol. People who drink aren't labeled as Non-alcoholic/alcoholic, so i feel it's kinda silly to define people as smokers/non-smokers just to force the absolute.""**This is what helped my roommate quit:**  I work in a lab researching Cystic Fibrosis which is a disease that primarily affects the lungs. There is no cure for it yet, people are born with it and generally their life expectancy is only about 30 years. It is caused by a mutated gene that affects an important protein within our cells making that protein mostly non-functional. There is another researcher in my lab that is researching the affects of cigarette smoke and recently she found that smoking cigarettes *affects the exact same protein* within the lung cells. Basically, cigarette smoking biologically mimics Cystic Fibrosis. When I told my roommate that he was basically ""giving himself Cystic Fibrosis,"" it really resonated with him and he switched to an e-cigarette to help him quit smoking. It's only been about 3 weeks but so far so good!""I stopped smoking... seriously, when you just not do it for more than a month, it becomes really easy...

Smoked for about 8 years, was at a about a carton a week when I stopped.

I thought to myself, ""if people quit cold turkey after smoking for 50 years straight, I should have no problem unless there is something physically or psychologically wrong with me."" Now I'm not fucked in the head, so surely I must be able to quit just like them. Turns out that is true! Just gotta belittle yourself and call yourself a pussy for not doing it right then and there. All these withdrawal effects everybody's so afraid of barely even happened with me, I feel ten times worse when I go a day without coffee.

Also, you're not *quitting smoking*, you just don't smoke anymore. That helped, too.

After learning to drink without smoking, everything else was easier. I started making little rules for myself, like no smoking while driving, then no smoking while at home, then at work...

Took about two or three weeks until I completely quit. I took it for two months total because you are supposed to take it for one full month after you quit. That was about two years ago. Since then there have been a few times, typically while drinking I'll take one from a friend and usually throw it out cause it tastes so bad to me these days.

Putting the money I'd otherwise be spending on cigs into savings/the occasional splurge helped, too.

I smoked for 8 yrs and after several attempts to quit I finally called the smokers helpline. They sent me a 100 page packet on nicotine and its effects on peoples brains. In short, the nocotine molecule is very similar in shap to the dopamine molecule. Hence during smoking you are tricking your brain into being rewarded for 5 to 6 mins straight as opposed to a natural 30 second or so burst. This creates a heightened sense of well being which begins to feel normal, effectively making normal feel like being depressed.

I will say, I have amped up my fitness and I love how healthy I'm feeling - so that drives me too.

You just have to want to change.  Good luck!""You ultimately just have to have the will power to quit. If you don't want to quit, it's just not going to happen.""Got really sick, stopped for about 10 days, used only e-smokes afterward, stopped e-cigs after about six weeks. 13 months clean but really want a cigarette even now.""Stop smoking gradually, challenge yourself.  
åÊ  
Quit for a week.  
Smoke for a week.  
Quit for a month.  
Smoke a month.
  
Current record 18 mounts, and I won't smoke again because I will be a father soon, but I learned that I can live without it :)""18 mounts, hot DAMN!"I would consider incentives. Pregnancy.  Top shelf anti-smoking motivator."Making a New Years resolution.  No joke.  First and last one I will ever make.

It was getting too expensive and I actually started caring about my health.  It was enough motivation to just say no."Cold turkeyI stopped buying cigarettes."I caught pneumonia, which pretty much forced the whole none smoking thing.  Keeping a disposable e-cig clenched in my hand for the next three months, while not actually really using it except when at bars and was around people who were smoking.  Once I got over that, I've had no problems. ""Met my girlfriend. She doesn't know that I smoked. She mentioned the first time I met her that she thought smokers were gross. So, I went cold turkey before I asked her out. 
That was two years ago. And I'm still with her and haven't had a one since 5 minutes before I asked her out.""Start exercising. trying to run as much as I could every day would help. At first, the longest I could run was 5 minutes on the treadmill at 5mph. It got harder, then I started to feel better. Also, don't tell yourself you'll never smoke again. Accept that you will have more cigarettes in life, BUT  you will only smoke when you want AND as you keep running, you'll realize you dont want to smoke. I quit two years ago, but I would say I smoke maybe 3 times a month just cos I want to. I still run, and I noticed how much better I feel. This may not work for me, but I remember thinking I would never quit because I didn't want to have my LAST cigarette. ""I started dipping tobacco to quit smoking. I helped, but I still got cravings to fill my lungs with smoke. Watching boardwalk empire was particularly difficult. 

But eventually I could satisfy the cravings with a dip. But now I habitually dip, so I guess it's not the best alternative. But I do feel healthier now. I know dipping still carries risks, but I no longer get wheezy after walking up a few flights of stairs."Keep smoking! It puts hair on your nuts! Don't let these jerks make you think its bad for you."E-cigs. When I got mine, I smoked the rest of my regular cigs nearly back to back and made a deal with myself that I was done. If the e-cigs didn't work, I still wouldn't smoke another. It has been about 1.5 years. ""I was no good at cutting back, and cold turkey played right into my physical addiction. I decided not to fight the cravings and smoke whenever I wanted, as long as I smoked through my nose. Forget the French inhale; I would stuck a butt in a nostril and savor the flavor. It didn't take long for my brain to grasp the fact that my addiction was running the show, and that a guy so weak and weird as to stick cigarettes up his nose was never going to get a girlfriend. I really wanted a girlfriend... And my nose burned, and nothing smelled good. My habit had changed from something cool to something pathetic and detestable. I was finally ready to quit, but there was another factor at play: the cigarette as prop. What was I to do with myself and my habit energy? For this, I decided to mitigate the habit by analysis. Pat a pocket, find a pack, take one out, flick a zippo, suck inhale, then point and gesture with the hand holding the cig; These are the steps, but the only thing that really needed to change was the inhaling of smoke, so I went through the ritual exactly, but without lighting the butt. I discovered that if I focused on inhaling clean air and holding it for a beat,(like pretending to smoke), that I would relax and feel calm. I pretended to smoke every time I felt like lighting up until this too began to feel weird, first dropping the hand motions while continuing the deep inhales, and finally forgetting that I had a habit in the first place.""13000 comments, this will likely get lost in the wash, but...

Quit a pack and a half of camel in 1994.  Here's how it worked for me.

First, DO NOT try to MAKE it happen.  Every time I made an effort, it never worked.  You are fighting your own decision maker (your will), and IT get's to make the decisions.  So this is tough.



Just wait for a day when, for whatever reason, you've been unable to smoke all day.  For me, that was extensive dental work.

At the end of the day, I thought ""If I smoke now, the whole day will have been for nothing"".

Next day: """"If I smoke now, the whole day will have been for nothing"".""

Next day: """"If I smoke now, the whole day will have been for nothing"".""

At the end of the first week, ""If I smoke now, the whole week will have been for nothing"".

At the end of the month: ""If I smoke now, the whole month will have been for nothing"".

And so on and so forth.
""Panic Attacks. I started having them right before I moved to the other side of the country. Panic attacks make you really irrationally scared of stuff. I tried to smoke a cigarette after my first panic attack, it elevated my heart rate and I was immediately fully convinced that I was dying right then and there. 

It was easy to quit cold turkey when the fear of death by cigarette was shifted from 30 years in the future to right now. "Dying"I tried smoking a fish but I couldn't keep it lit
"Getting cancer"I moved to Colorado,  the high elevation and thin air was enough to quit.""quit cold turkey. then maybe you can have a cig every once and a while, after you're sure you're not hooked anymore""[My method (Don't reveal if you don't want to have your MIND BLOWN)](#s ""Stop buying cigarettes."")"[deleted]Certain people have different tolerance for addiction. How about you not be a bitch and stop acting tough on the internet when you are probably a 15 year old troll"I'm a non-smoker and always have been. I found the logic behind smoking to be completely out of whack. So, when I came across the Alan Carr's Easy Way method where they slap you in the face with logic I had to share it with my smoker friends. 3 of them haven't smoked in about 5 years. So, I guess it works. "Probation. Going to have to stay away from r/trees for awhile:(Crack cocaineHeroin. Either this is a joke or you are a complete retard."**I hope nobody is offended by this.**

Smoking is stupid, only weak minded, idiots still smoke.

Strong men, in the prime of their life are among the lowest rate of smoking.

Now mostly it is women, kids, and old folk still smoking.

I have never smoked. Everybody I know who has quit is strong willed and has done it cold turkey.

Actually I hope you are offended by this, enough to make you stop."I stopped smoking."I had a very vivid dream in which I was about 40 with pipes and tubes and stuff in my nose and my mouth with my brother sat at my bedside holding my hand. I knew in my dream I was dying from smoking and it felt so unbelievably real. It scared the hell out of me. I knew when I woke up I didn't want to smoke again and I didn't. I went from 30 a day to nothing. I don't even get the urge to have one when I'm drunk, I was that terrfied by this dream and how real it felt.""I decided I wanted to quit but several things I did really helped me along the way:
1) Something so tiny and insignificant (essentially a plant wrapped up in some paper) had such behavior-altering power over me.  My pride took a gut punch at the thought of it!
2) I took up running as in I went out and found as many races to sign up for as I could starting with 5K's, 10K's, and eventually a marathon.  I found that running and exercise took away the cig addiction and gave me a new one!
Sorry to sound so cliche but in the end its all about you deciding to quit and seeing your self moving forward in life as a non-smoker.  Once you've made up your mind, its much easier.  Take it one day at a time!!""I smoked for almost ten years. Firstly it helped that i went to work where nobody smoked so it wasn't regular cigarette breaks with work buddies.  This reduced my smoking to about five cigs a day (except while drinking)  
  
Then one spring few years ago we had some strange birch pollen in the air that gave me the worst allergic reactions ever. I've had some little sneezing every now and then but this was something awful, my eyes were like tennis balls, i had trouble breathing and my nose was just solid stuck. This lasted for almost two weeks and it didn't even come to mind to smoke a single cigarette. And so i was done, smoke quitting succesful. I've had occasional party cigarettes or cigars every now and then but never wanted to light another the next day.""I have been smoke free for a year and a half (I do occasionally smoke weed but I don't count that). I had been a pack every day to two days. I had tried to quit a few times before and with minimal success. I would feel great and feel proud of myself but, sure enough, something incredibly stressful would pop up and I would light up again. What did it for me this time was sheer determination. I truly wanted to quit. I decided one day to gradually cut back on the number of cigarettes I would smoke in a day. This was no easy task, so I started to implement breathing techniques to help alleviate stress and withdrawals. I found a tactic that I used to use for my panic attacks as a teenager where I would shut everything out and focus on my breathing. Imagine as if every breath of air you take in is the most clean, fresh, delicious and cleansing breath of air you have ever taken in. Now for every breath out, you are removing the years of smoke, negativity and stress. I tried to take 10 breaths and in the time my cravings would subside. Now, I would allow myself two ""cheats"" per day. If that couldn't work then I would let myself have one. Over time I would get disappointed in myself for giving into the weakness. A few months later I would only have cravings while drinking. Again, I would remove myself from temptations and focus the best I could on something else. This was the hardest part for me. I am not saying this way is the easiest way to quit but I have had friends try it and they have told me it has helped with some cravings. As I said earlier it takes determination to quit. I still get cravings and at times I want to murder someone for a cig, however, I remind myself of the wasted time and effort if I begin to smoke and I also remind myself of the way I now feel physically and mentally. Quitting does help your health. If that is your main importance then make it so. Find what you want to gain out of quitting and try a couple plans. It's not easy but you CAN do it. Sorry to rant, hope this helps! ""I quit by first cutting back and switching to 
American spirits. I'm convinced that American spirits 
Were part of my success in quitting. Next, I quit cold 
turkey at first but when the physical cravings became
Too much I bought a generic brand of the patch and 
cut them in 1/2 at first and then thirds.  The patch helped
maintain a happy mood while I got the through the first 
2 weeks. I also had amazing dreams while on the patch. 
after two weeks I drastically reduced the use of the patch to about 
1/3 of a 14mg(?) patch p/day.  I also began to excercise which
Was frustrating at first because my endurance was so diminished
The exercise just increases my resolve to get off cigarettes. After about
A month I was feeling so good that I had no intention of slipping. 
After being a smoker for 17 years I successfully quit in 2000.  I feel great and have since done 2 triathlons. ""I smoked for 17 years (started age 7, quit at 24). I smoked 3 packs a day for the last 6 years of my smoking life, and if you know quality cigarettes, you'll wonder how I'm still alive when I tell you that I smoked Export A Green King Size.

Yeah. 3 packs of those. Per day.

I had early onset emphysema at 23.

My parents are also smokers. They tried to quit using Champix (Chantex in the US, I believe). Once they quit, I asked for their leftovers.

Using only the left over Champix, I went from 3 packs a day to quit in just over 3 weeks, with almost no effort. When I needed a cigarette, I would just find something to occupy myself for 5 minutes.

""I'll just finish this race,"" or ""I'll just finish this chapter,"" or whatever I was doing. I'd put off smoking for 5 minutes, and then forget that I needed a cigarette for 3 hours.

Champix made quitting stupendously easy. I recommend anyone interested in quitting smoking at least look into it. Maybe it's not for you. Or maybe, just maybe, you'll end up like me. 5 years later, no relapses, able to breathe, and exercise, and not worry about suffocating to death by 35.

Good luck.""Smoked a pack a day since my teens. Not the lawbreaking type but I missed a court date and was held in jail for about a week until I could see a judge. I was basically forced into quitting cold turkey. Got out, figured the worst was already over and never looked back.""I quit cold turkey, going on 7 months now after smoking for 15 years. Anytime I had a craving I would take a deep breath, have a drink of water, and it would pass.  Also at the end of the day I would tweet #Smokefree Day 7 or whatever as a daily goal.   ""Having a kid. I lived in an apartment building when my first child was born. It was impossible to go outside and have regular smoke breaks with her gobbling up all my time, energy and attention. Try making a baby, it's pretty darn easy.""electronic cigarettes.  Actually, I didn't smoke much, but as soon as I found vaporizers, I started again because I love nicotine, just not the carcinogens!

Edit:  Oh, I haven't had a real cigarette in over a year.""avoid other smokers
""I tried to quit multiple times over a 15 year stretch.  The final breaking point was while I was in college with children at home.  We couldn't afford nice things and my children's clothes smelled of cigarette smoke.  I realized that I had become one of those dads.  I hated what that said about me.  I decided that I wanted to be a good parent for my good children.  It took a few hours of weird brain time but I then became an ex smoker.  Yesterday I was a smoker, today I am not.  I knew I would go through withdrawals and all the other problem that are associated with over coming physical addiction but I knew I could deal with that.  I looked at it like I was physically shedding the past.  
I still want a cigarette now and then and have had a few over the last couple of years, but I hated every one of them because I'm not a smoker.

tl/dr: you won't smoke if you're not a smoker.  Call your mom when you want to light up.  It won't help but I'm sure she would like to hear from you. ""My wife and I quit in '05, before we got married.  Beyond the health effects, I was embarrassed to be a smoker...it's not acceptable to most people I know.  I didn't want to hide a cig at my own wed reception.
My non-scientifically proven plan...Part I: Got drunk while watching Sopranos DVDs and take periodic multi-cig chain-smoke breaks.  The next morning I felt pretty crappy and didn't want to smoke.  Part II: Replace the ""reward""...I would use a treat (candy/snack/etc) instead of smoke...I chewed sunflower seeds in my car (biggest crave spot) for about 2 years.  Part III: Convince yourself that you are worth it and you are stronger than this challenge...look at what amazing people overcome (poverty-hunger/ultra-marathons/war)...all you have to do is Not smoke.  Best wishes!
"Not me but my grandma. When my grandpa proposed to her he told her that it was only on the condition that she quit smoking. So she stopped. Later my grandmother found out that she was highly susceptible to lung damage. My grandpa saved my grandma's life because of this."My then-girlfriend quit after I told her ""I want to spend the rest of my life with you, but I don't want to have that cut short because of cigarettes."" She's now my wife of 10 years (and never got back into the habit).""Here is my way and while I have not ever heard the same story, I think it could be duplicated. I will give u a timeline ""version"".

Year one- switched to Winston lights, then ultra lights.
Year two - started dating a non smoker, so didn't smoke as much when around her. As we got more serious, I smoked less because we were together more. She insisted I brush my teeth before kissing, so kind of limited my desire to smoke. Found that I would smoke maybe one or two the days we were together and fewer and fewer on the days we weren't. 
Year three - hardly smoking, maybe a pack a week, sometime more. I agree to quit outright when girlfriend asks.
Year four - ""cheated"" by sneaking a smoke every month or so for the first 6 months, then maybe two or three the rest of the year.
Next 12 years - had four since considering myself ""Quit"". 

TL:DR switch to low power cig, slow down over a couple,years, don't beat yourself up over cheating after you quit."I threw away my smokes and didnt buy anymore..."I smoked two packs a day for ten years and what did it for me was actually a visit to a specialist in Raleigh who gives a shot in your ear of a drug called scoplamine sp?  The cost was about 300 dollars and the success rate is 90%.  You have to want to quit because it takes about 80% of the cravings away, however you feel a little funny and you wear a patch with the same drug behind your ear for two weeks.  A little blurry vision was the main side effect I noticed.  Not bad to quit after 2 packs a day for ten years.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS.  I have recommended the treatment to a few people I work with and all have been successful the first time.  If you really want to quit I believe this is the way to go.  PS. his name is Dr. Stocks in Raleigh.  ""I smoked a pack a day for about ten years. I never drank, so that wasn't my trigger, neither was coffee. My problem was driving a car. Everytime I got in my car I wanted a smoke. Yes, after sex and a meal was great, but I had to have the cigarette in the car. I found the one thing that helped me when I really wanted to quit was replacing the ritual. That lead me to...Apples! It takes about four to five minutes to smoke a cigarette. It takes the same amount of time to eat an apple. The hand to mouth movement is the same, and it is very odd how the apple became something I could rely on when I went to my car. The only thing I had to do was quit smoking at other times. It became easier and easier, but I still needed that apple in the car. Now, 12 years later I am still smoke free. I don't NEED the apple, but, hell, why not sometimes? It is healthy to eat the apple in general and it is nice to do in the car. Sounds weird, I know, but it helped me. ""Allan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking book worked AMAZINGLY well. I have bad willpower. Like you, my biggest trigger was being at work...always looking for excuses to leave the office. It really was controlling my life. I found it to be a really empowering book. It doesn't guilt you or just ramble on about the health effects of smoking--it really offers insight into why we smoke and allows us to change the way we view smoking so that we find it undesirable. It also encourages you to smoke as much as you can while you read it, and prepares you for the final cigarette. By that point, I was so happy to put it out, and never light up again!""bupropion (wellbutrin) medication. worked like magic!
its actually an antidepressant and anxiety med but helps w/ quitting. ""I smoked 1-2 packs a day for 25yrs and just over a year ago I quit cold turkey. 
Was it the hardest thing I've ever done, absolutely not in fact it was far easier than I had ever imagined! 
How did I do it, I had thought about it for a while worrying about the mood swings, the over eating all the things you hear about that make people afraid to just quit. But I knew that if I didn't focus on those things and instead remembered something a doctor had once told me ""the craving for a cigarette only lasts 5mins"" then all I had to do was make it through those 5mins. 

I made my decision to go for it and to stick with it for 3 days no matter what, then after those first 3 days to 5 days, then a week, then 2 weeks and to try to make it a month no matter what. I broke it down into small periods so that if I fell off my smokefree wagon I wouldn't be so discouraged that I'd give up trying. Did I fall off, yes twice in the first 2weeks but I didn't purchase a pack and say 'I can't do it' and keep smoking, I told myself to just get on with it and I would be OK, and you know what it worked. 

I didn't have crazy mood swings, I did snack more than I should have but the best way to combat that is of course to go out and get some exercise. My breathing is better than it has been in years, I am financially better off and I don't reek of smoke any more. Best decision I ever made and believe me if I can do it then I really think anyone can. 

I know many people that have managed to quit using patches/gum but I don't know anyone that has managed to quit by using ecigs/vapes because they weren't breaking the physical habit of smoking and I firmly believe that until you break that part of the habit it is just making it more difficult to quit completely. 

My advice, go cold turkey I know of more people that succeeded (and are still smokefree) by going cold turkey than any other way! 

Tell your friends, family and co-workers that you are trying to do and when you make it through another day tell them that you didn't smoke and accept the very well deserved pat on the back they will give you, you'll feel so great!

TL;DR
Decide when you want to start your smokefree new life and just go day by day cold turkey. No matter how desperate you think you are for a smoke DO NOT BUY A PACK, ask someone for one if you are that desperate but don't buy a pack, but even better if you just wait 5mins and the craving will pass! 

Good luck, you can do it!!!!
 "Don't be a fucking idiot in the first place "Camel Snus Large pouches have helped me to quit. I know its not a safe alternative, but I have read studies stating they are safer than normal chewing tobacco! It also nice not having to spit. So you can do it at work without anyone even knowing.
