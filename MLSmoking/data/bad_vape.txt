I come here for support....to vent....to encourage....to listen and speak truths.I will continue to come here for my first year, because whoever I made this pledge to originally kinda knows what he's talking about.....when people slip away from their supportive community, they often slip away from their commitment to NOPE. I read something the other day that made me ask myself....."Well Julie, why do you come here?"I see, and am experiencing something very similar to recovery from other addictions that I have and have sought treatment for.There is proven power in a community of positive support. I don't come here to 'save' people......not because I don't want to save people, but because I cant save people.As it is with any diagnoses, I can help you treat your cancer, but I cannot save you from your cancer.I can help you treat your addiction.....but I cannot save you from your addiction. But the strange thing is.....and if it weren't so amazing, it would be ridiculous,When I help you,I save myselffrom my own addiction. Im making the commitment.....Im committing to one year here. (I really feel as if Im just re-committing. Ive already made a pledge to stay with a supportive non-smoking community for one year. In 12 step circles, many of us have something called a 'home group': a place where we commit ourselves to showing up as much for ourselves as for others. Ive done nothing more than change my 'home group'. My committment stands. It just stands here)  :)
I agree with everything you said. I re-pledge my commitment for 1 year (I too already pledged somewhere else). Sorry people, you are stuck with me for a while :p
Likewise - I'm here to support and be supported. I'll stay a year or more...
I pledge to be here for the long haul.  :)
I have never since today pledged anywhere except on a daily but today I pledge to remain here for at least my one year Anniversary to be supported and to pay it forward This is my pledge
I'm not going anywhere just yet......
Same here. I am here for the time being, one day at a time.But Smokefree forever...
I pledge to stay here for at least my 2-year anniversary and have no plans of leaving. I have "quit" so many times in the past without a good support system and always relapsed. A support system is key for a successful quit. I couldn't have done it without you guys!
Okey Dokey Non-Smokey, I'm In.  :)
Yes i pledge for one year, but you could be sorry! 
Bumping this.....just until Cristobal gets here and begins one :)
be here as long as possible :D 
I pledged a while ago ..I pledged to pay it forward and that's what I am trying to do and I will continue to do so! The location changed...but not the meaning of my pledge! I am committed to "pay it forward for 1 year. I am committed to sign up for support as often as I can..I am committed to help other people who want to quit for 1 year. I will be around for a while :-) This has been the meaning of my pledge then...and now!
 But the strange thing is.....and if it weren't so amazing, it would be ridiculous,When I help you,I save myselffrom my own addiction. Soberjulie, exactly!  Most of the time, we don't even know we're helping ourselves when we're helping others... this was an awesome post!
I never pledged to stay a year before, but I am more than happy on this Quit Train to pledge however long it takes, even to just help one person reach their quit, so for the foreseeable future I am committed to being here (OMG what did I just agree to LOL) for a year and more xx
Im still here......I am absent a lot. But I am here :)  I havent totally flaked out on my commitment  :P
Definitely a nice one, thanks!
Julie: tthe ultimate weapon 
Oops i meant"The ultimate weapon for recovery is the recovering addict"
I'm so happy to see this still pinned 
Who are you?
I've missed you, you smart ass pork product 
Still here and how's my brother?
Hi Julie, I like how you made the home group connection. I would never miss my home group so I will not miss a day here. Thanks! Michelle
Bumping for our newer members.   Please do this.  I can vouch for its effectiveness. 
Good morning all you lovely smoke free, delicious smelling people! 
Yep. Good idea
I showed up for the comradrie.  I stayed for the crazy so...put another pot on. 
I'm still here, more than 2 years after my pledge.  I guess you are stuck with me guys, even if I'm not here as often as I used to be. I haven't thought about smoking a cigarette for bloody ages now; it's been so long that I can't even remember!
Pimp
Sometimes need to pass by and make sure the old-timers are getting too grouchy...  ;)
 The quit forum was the most powerful tool I used to stay quit, beyond all doubt. 
The quit forum was the most powerful tool I used to stay quit, beyond all doubt.Same here!! I often participate in other forums (alcoholism and drug addiction forums, classic car restoration forums, and current event/debate type forums) I'll sometimes come across someone who mentions they are struggling with trying to quit smoking. My reply is ALWAYS the same: I send them the link to here. 
Romance thoughts make little Stewie pledge one year to this community. NOPE!
Nothing to romance about stewi..poisons,cancer,c.o.p.D...heart desease and more..Keep reading and keep climbing..NOPE !!!
I pledge my one year commitment now (hopefully many many many more years after that) :)
Love this Jackie..those who have pledged have succeeded..
Ok; I've seen and heard enough here to make me want to commit to a one year pledge to keep coming back here and sharing what I can with you old timers as well as those newbies that have yet to join us. I never tried to do anything like quitting smoking before and didn't really know what it would be like or what I would need to do to be successful at it. Once I had stopped and was in the depths of hell week, I figured there must be others out here who are going through this and maybe they could help me keep at it. I never imagined I'd find the kind of support I have found here. It is truly that extra ingredient I needed to get me through the tough times. I'm feeling ever stronger about being able to beat this addiction into the history books of my consciousness but I also know I need to keep this goal top of mind to be sure I make this my permanent quit. Joining you all here and pledging NOPE as well as sharing stories about our common experiences on a regular basis will be just the thing I need in order to accomplish this. While I'm here, I can only hope that I have the same positive affect on someone else that you all have had on me :)
I love this post R...Everyone here has so much to offer in supporting each other..oldies,middleuns.. Newbies...This is why this fabulous place works..You my friend are a great asset here...posting your yearly pledge..is a great tool..Between you and us...you will reach that lido deck with pride...I believe those quitters who find themselves here..are the luckiest quitter ever...And now and again ..we have fun..
I just hope there's a buffet on that lido deck .................... I'm counting on it :P
I'm in, as of now, tonite, smoked my last cigarette! Im committed to being with you all for at least a yr. everyday I'm going to need you all for awhile. Been hedging & hawing about to use the patch or go cold turkey. But with my support team here I think I'll do cold turkey. You'll be seeing me everyday for awhile 
Not sure that I am supposed to commitment to one year before my actually quit date. But I am pleading to be a part of this community and forum for one year. 
Welcome (again) Stwine!You can commit any time you like. Your commitment is a good thing as it's really a promise to yourself that you will stay close to the community for the support you will no doubt need along the way. Actually, the people who do commit here and stay with the board along the way are much more successful than those that do not make the commitment so; welcome aboard!!
While stuffing my face with tangerine after tangerine, and cursing out my Hell Week, I lurked here. And read. Post after post. Topic after topic. And it kept me sane. And it kept me from putting things in my mouth and setting them on fire. And it showed me that quitting was possible. That life after smoking could be really, really good. And that gave me hope, motivated me and kept me going, hour after hour. And so, about two and a half weeks into my quit, I jumped aboard. And, aside from my initial decision to quit, joining this forum is the best decision I've made. No one can do this for you - you have to want it for yourself - but they can sure make that journey better and so much easier. Quitting doesn't seem so frightening to me anymore. I'm actually enjoying it.  Though I have people who support me offline, it's not quite the same. Here, you'll always be supported, and understood and welcomed by a great community of people who really know exactly what you're going through, or have been through or will go through. I haven't been here long, and yet, I feel I'm right where I should be. (And I really, really like you guys. :wub: ) So, you're now stuck with me! I pledge at least a year. I'm here to be supported, and to offer my support wherever it's needed. Let's do this thing!  :)
Great post pix...your goin to make it...and we will be here to cheer you on.x
A year? Wait a minute. Let me check my calendar.......... Yeah. I'm good. :D ​
A year? Wait a minute. Let me check my calendar.......... Yeah. I'm good. :D ​High five !!!!                    
I've already committed to a year at another board and I will do the same here. I've had many months long quits in the past so I am not taking anythig for granted. I will not get complacent. I will NOPE every day. Thank you. 
I'm nearly at a year smoke free in July. But as a late comer i commit a year and over to Quit Train forum  :yahoo:  :yahoo:  :yahoo:
So happy you 2 will stick around even after your other board gets back up and running. We're a little weird here sometimes but we may just grow on you over time  :D
Good move you two, quitting smoking is a marathon not something you do in a couple of months; being here strengthening your resolve is smart. I wish you success.
There is no such thing ..as having enough support..putting them killer cigs down for ever ..is the main thing..Do what you have to do ..to achieve that...good work ...
I committ to a year. My last quit failed at 7 months because of what GeaceLove mentioned. Complacency. Got too comfortable last quit, like, "I got this!"  One puff later and I was DONE!  WELL NOT THIS TIME NICOTINE!!!  I got smarter and stronger from that last quit. This one sticks. I want to be here to support and be supported. NOPE!!!
Glad to have ya Rob :) Great attitude too. You know the drill and now you have that previous quit and relapse experience to draw from so I think you will be just fine. Look forward to following your journey with us!
Let's make this your sticky quit rob...buckle up...there will be a few curves ahead..But that's OK..just hold on..this train goes all the way to freedom ..
365 Days not so long time flys when you are hanging with good people.
Hiya all you sweet smelling non-smokers! Checking in!
Well !!!..Hello there jules ...hope all is well in your smoke free corner ...Hugs to the little man...xx
Doreen, would you believe it? I have TWO little men now. Mav was three in Jan (just ahead of my quit date) and Daxton will be one next month 
Good to see some "seasoned veterans" dropping by once and a while :)
Doreen, would you believe it? I have TWO little men now. Mav was three in Jan (just ahead of my quit date) and Daxton will be one next month So grateful to not be 'stinky grandma'Oh wow !!!Congratulations to all...how lovely ..xxxx

If you stick with people that have been through this struggle ready to support you, plus all the information, youll be increading your chances of success. And im sure you will suceed :)
I hereby commit to one year on this board, staying quit right through. And beyond. I appreciate the direct support from all of you and the implicit support gained from helping others. 
Brilliant PT...let's get you on the Lido Deck..and commitment.. Will get you there..Plus we love a good party !!!...
On my up to visit w/you! Thank again for this great forum & having support is very important to our recovery! I'm looking forward to many days, months & years of being a non smoker & can't think of better place to be! I'm buckled up & ready for a fantastic voyage! 
Proud of you Jewel...look at that ticker..it's heading towards 2 months...Keep marchin...x
I will commit to one year on this forum with all you fabulously crazy people!! <3
Good to see you...welcome home !!!!whahaha...
I will commit to one year on this forum with all you fabulously crazy people!! <3 Alright lad! This is useful ammo against the smokes. Stick around and you will suceed no doubt.
Good decision! Having a support network as you go through triggers that may come along through all the seasonal changes is a good idea :)
I had the wrong idea.   I thought this forum was to tease the one they call "Bakon". But then someone mentioned trying to quit smoking. I thought, "Well, that is a tangent from the main point of this place, yes?" Then it got mentioned a few times. I thought, "well I just gave it up myself early October. Maybe I can join the chat."    The reason I am here - I followed a friend here (though she is presently MIA) but stayed for the mostly light-hearted chat. I am still not sure if this is mainly a "quit smoking board" or a "poke good fun at each other board" but either way who wouldn't enjoy it? But anyways - I am not planning on taking up smoking again as there is NO reason to. I gave away my cigarette rolling machine and I am not about to go pay $5 a pack for some stupid nasty cancer sticks. So yeah, being on board for a year is but the beginning. Coming up on two months quit, the desire to smoke has faded to a faint background noise a couple times a day and lasts maybe two seconds.    I shall be here.
So glad to see your commitment to stay smoke free for 1 year...folks who commit to this..usually go off and have a great smoke free life... We tease Bakon..O.M.G....I nearly choked on my breakfast... It's clear you have not read past posts..   You have alot to learn ...  I am still here because for me...this place worked... We do have a fun side...and a serious side...I feel the balance is just right...  There is a saying...Take what you want...and leave the rest.... We love our Bakon..warts and all...x
    All clear. Carry on.
I was committed....   got the 'stificate to prove it too....     More importantly, I commit to sticking with this CRAZY lot in here......    I forgot myself once...   not going to forget myself a second time... that would be absoflaminglutely ludicrous!!   
Newbies,    Make the commitment. One year on the train, keep yourself accountable. When you come and pledge not to take a puff just for that day 365 times, you win.
I am committing to one year. Only 364 more nopes to go!
Just now, LizQuit said:             I am committing to one year. Only 364 more nopes to go!             Smart move lad. Come nope daily, dont fail you. Its a matter of noping.
Just now, LizQuit said:             I am committing to one year. Only 364 more nopes to go!         Good Stuff - a year seems a long way off but .... it isn't. You'll see.     Oh and, Stewie calls everyone "lad" so, not to worry - lol.
    Good job Liz. I firmly believe that being a part of a "quitting community" like Quit Train, and committing to being active and contributing for a full year, is decisive in being successful in quitting.
    ditto wot Lin said^^^^^^^^^ oooh whats happened I got an extra dot and promotion to advanced member ??????
OK signen on the dotted line an committen  to one year of bein a NOPE head. At least I'm smart enough to know I need the nope.      EDIT: Why has noone mentioned if this is legalised NOPE??? Do I need to be watching for the cops with I have me daily NOPE??????????????????????????????????Edited March 2, 2018 by notsmokinjocoffee overload induced random thought
    Pst pst yearly nope over here 
    I committed to one year at qsmb.....and I did it! Noped every single day! Now that I am over here....I commit to another year (at least) of doing the daily nope and offering support to others who may need it!             
For the most part, my quit has consumed my thoughts and attention the past several weeks. But each time I thought of the quit lasting more than the next moment or a day, I began to get overwhelmed.       I was at lunch, in my deep thought and meditation state, asking myself...What do I want from this?  A moment, a day, a week, a month? And I came to a calm place with the answer...I want to never smoke a cigarette again ... ever! And rather than get overwhelmed, I was at peace with myself. I understand there will be battles with my thoughts, but as someone wise  and experienced said...the war is won. I ALREADY QUIT. I don't need to continue fighting that war; but I must be diligent and strong in fighting the  isolated battles/attacks to keep my freedom.      I commit to 1 year here.  But don't be suprised if you have to put with me for a lot longer.
    the﻿ ﻿war is won. I﻿ ALREADY Q﻿UIT. I don't need to continue fighting that war; but I must be diligent and strong in fighting the  isolated battles/attacks to keep my freedom.         Love this !!!.....you are indeed already a fabulous non smoker....all you have to do..is stay a non smoker....well done !!!

I commit to a year because that’s when I get myself a new 4K big screen LCD television. I want at least a 55  Incher. Maybe even some new audio equipment too.  I’ve had the same 36 inch plasma for more than 10 years. It’s time… and I deserve it!
I started off noping accidentely. Then the intended but cautious nope once in a while, afterwards waiting for some miracle fairy to land on my shoulder telling me everythings gonna be alright now and that I am safe in the garden of nopers.         Last week it clicked. Daily noping won't save me from lighting up, daily noping will strengthen my resolve. Only me, myself and I have the responsability for lighting/not lighting up.         Humble because I'm only 7 weeks in ... but uhm, I think I'm finally on to something the old sages keep repeating .      So, I am committing to one year (and the inner voice saying ... 'You? You don't like being part of groups, you don't make commitments! What about that commitment you made as a child after that one horrible thing happened, the commitment you made to do it all by yourself?' Well. Maybe it's time to ditch that one and replace it for something new.       Edited October 9, 2018 by MLMR
    I will remain here for one year. 
1 year committed! Looking forward to learning my true self over the course of this year.
I pledge to be here for the long haul.
Lifetime commitment, 1 day at a time
    Thought about it, and I am willing to stay on this forum at least one year. Helping myself, keeping the quit solid and by doing that being there for other quitters.    (So there ppl... you are gonna have to put up with me now )

Subtitle: The Romance Is Dead!  This is the time of year when many people quit smoking. Most especially, people who quit before but relapsed are trying again. I think that is wonderful (that they're coming back, not that they relapsed). Reading their posts has made me realize that in very many cases, people relapse because they are still romancing the cigarette. That means that they still WANT to smoke even though they know that smoking does nothing good for them. They still remember those quietly satisfying evenings on the deck smoking. They remember that a-a-a-h-h-h! of satisfaction with the first long draw on a cigarette. And they want that again. And so even if they are weeks or months into a quit-- even though the PHYSICAL addiction is long gone-- they essentially choose to go back to smoking because of the pull of these romantic fantasies about how good smoking was. Well, I was the poster child for romancing the cigarette. Throughout this quit and all my previous quits (of which there were several) I always wanted to smoke. I didn't smoke-- I controlled myself-- but I wanted to smoke. All the time. Almost every day. It seemed to me that after 4 or 5 months quit, almost everybody on the board was way done with smoking and happy about it. I still missed it. And that was frustrating because my rational brain KNEW that the "pleasure" of smoking was vastly over rated and mostly imaginary. I KNEW that I was romancing the cigarette and I really did not want to go back to smoking. But the seductive thoughts were there. Maybe not every day, but often enough to be very annoying. I'm here to tell you that today, more than 9 months after my quit, I realize that I am not desiring a cigarette hardly ever! This is a first for me. And this death of the romance is not just a matter of time-- I quit smoking before for periods of up to a year and still suffered from romancing. I think that the difference this time is that I educated myself about Nicodemon's lies. It's as though my rational brain has told my junkie brain over and over and over again "No, smoking is NOT pleasurable! And such small, brief pleasure as you feel when you smoke comes at way too great a cost! Forget it!" and finally, FINALLY junkie brain is quieting down. What a relief! Now I do admit that during these "romancing episodes" that I'm talking about-- those days when I really, really wanted a cigarette-- I had to remind myself over and over again about why I quit smoking in the first place and remind myself over and over again that I wanted to quit more than I wanted to smoke. I had to FIGHT to keep my quit many, many times over the months. The urge to smoke wasn't constant, but it was frequent. Sometimes it was quite miserable. I'm still jealous of people who seemed to have it easier than I did. I often thought that I was a "special snowflake" and I had it harder than other quitters-- few people admitted that they still wanted to smoke many months after a quit. But whether I had it worse than anyone else or not, I hung in there, reminded myself about why I quit, and that I was DETERMINED not to smoke.Now, at last, I can look back over the last few weeks and realize that the romance is dead. I finally, finally am at the point where I do think about smoking once in a while but it's like a vague thought that is easily dismissed, not a serious desire. I have heard others describe this "vague thought" phenomenon many months after a quit and I finally understand what they are talking about. So I guess I am writing this to say that if you are many weeks or months into a quit and you still want a cigarette, you are not alone. What you are experiencing is real. It does happen to some people (like me, for example). You are romancing the cigarette and you have to use your rational brain, your smoking education, and your strong desire to quit to fight the urge. And eventually, sooner or later, you will turn around one day and realize that the romance is dead. You really don't have to fight to keep your quit anymore-- you just have to remain vigilant and committed. Hang in there, folks!  You can DO this!
This makes me so happy - I am so happy for you Chrys :)
Oh Chrys,You have described my struggle exactly. The promise of light at the end of the tunnel is all that keeps me going some days.Thanks for the light!Karen
I really needed to hear this right now. I'm constantly romancing the cigarette and it's what made me relapse a week and a half ago.  Everybody said that the cravings will pass but I felt like they just wouldn't! I felt, and sometimes still feel, like I'm fighting every moment of the day to stay quit. The rational mind just goes out the window.  I have a huge hurdle this weekend...I'll be alone which is a trigger for me...and your post will hopefully help me through it.  It's good to dear that the cravings, or romancing the cigarette, takes a long time to subside for some people but even for those of us who take a while, they WILL go away.  Thank you, thank you. 
Thanks for this post Chrys!  
Wonderful post Chrys. Addiction to smoking is like any relationship - you need to work at it. The more that we addicts romance the notion of smoking, the more we bestow power on the cigarette by imbuing it with relaxing powers that it never had, then the more we feed and nurture the relationship. Sitting on the dock, kicking back, looking wistfully into the middle distance and taking a sip of cool clear water is just as relaxing as smoking the cigarette was...it is the moment of relaxation, of peace that we romance (quite rightly). Where we get it wrong is by believing that it was the sucking in of 10,000 noxious chemicals that 'made' the moment. For me, the key was to see how abusive the relationship was and to actively stop working at it. Smoking is not fun. It never was. The Great Pretender
Perfect this describes me totally, problem is I thought I was alone now I know I'm not this will work. Thank you 
... Sitting on the dock, kicking back, looking wistfully into the middle distance and taking a sip of cool clear water is just as relaxing as smoking the cigarette was...it is the moment of relaxation, of peace that we romance (quite rightly). Where we get it wrong is by believing that it was the sucking in of 10,000 noxious chemicals that 'made' the moment... You are oh so right, EB! For the longest time I thought that I could no longer enjoy any "quiet moments" because I no longer could sit and smoke. It took me forever to realize that I could still enjoy my quiet moments-- I could still savor a victory or celebrate a job well done or get away from screaming kids for a few minutes-- WITHOUT A CIGARETTE!! It seems silly to say this, but I was so used to resting and smoking that I really thought that if I couldn't smoke, I couldn't rest. Period. My life had to be go...go...go! I know, I know, that sounds crazy to you successful quitters, but when I was new to my quit, I really believed that.  Now, as you say, I understand that the cigarettes did not allow me to rest and/or reflect. I allowed myself to rest and/or reflect and Nicodemon was just co-opting that time to inject more poison into my body. Jeeze, isn't it amazing how nicotine scrambled our brains for so many years??!!
This is a wonderful post Chrysalis. I struggled like you did at certain times of my quit but when you hit that point where it becomes a vague, fleeting and easily dismissed thought THAT is a true "a-h-h-h-h-h-h" moment of satisfaction.
What I like, very much, about this post is that if someone (like me) had read Allen Carr numerous times but still felt the urge it shows you that you're ok and it can be perfectly normal. I wish I'd have had this post to read many years ago as I would have cracked on, head down, instead of thinking well I must be a special snowflake who can't quit because I still don't feel that peace and excitement that I thought was a given. This deserves to be pinned if you ask me.
Can this be pinned?
Perfect post.  Perfect timing.  :)
Up until recently I thought that I would be quit but wistful about smoking.  For example, the type of quitter who 20 years later mentions that she would smoke again if they came out with a harmless cig. I did  not find myself disgusted by smoke or wanting to tell people on the street not to smoke.  I was sad that I wasn't free like Allen Carr mentioned and wondered why.  However, over the last few months, gradually, any romancing went away. Previously, if I craved a smoke, I would picture myself smoking it, coughing, reversing any good health benefits I have now.  I would tell myself that I would not want to hurt my family or friends who were proud of me, or I would think about how this quit, my first quit, is my golden ticket, and to relapse would probably lead to me smoking and quitting over and over.  The other day I thought , because of an executive assistant moment , about smoking and my immediate response was, why would you want to do that? My self inventory found no emotion, no struggle, no disgust, just a simple, straight forward thought that I do not smoke. I am writing this just to show that quitting is a gradual process for many, I think, and one may need to take time to be neutral, free , according to his or her own path.
Awesome piece of writing, I have sometimes those voices that romantise cigarettes and I always use common sense to explain no I can't smoke one, it's junkie thinking and I'm not going to reply wit lighting up one. Even when I read the article I felt romance coming up. I just say NOPE I don't NEED a cig, I don't like a cig and it's awful. NOPE.
great post!!
This seems a very good place to post this video 
The written version of the above video is here http://www.addictionsandrecovery.org/relapse-prevention.htm
Excellent video, Sharon, thank you!  You know, I never believed that relapse happens suddenly. When people say, "I don't know what happened. I was doing fine and then I was at a party and someone offered me a cigarette and BAM! I was back to smoking before I even realized what happened!" Really, the seeds of relapse are planted days or weeks before the event; we just don't realize it. One of the things I like about this video is that it recognizes that these seeds are planted early and tells you how to recognize it and how to deal with it.  One thing I noticed about smoking (and that the video addresses early on) is that when we quit, if we don't do "self care" we are setting ourselves up for relapse. I mean, look at why we smoke. We smoke because we're bored or anxious or lonely. We smoke because we want to celebrate a small victory or because we're up to "here" with screaming kids and just need a 5 minute break. So we step outside or kick back in our chair and smoke for a few minutes. Then we feel calmer and ready to get back to our day. When we quit smoking, what do we do to fill those needs instead of smoking? How you do bleed off stress or anxiety? What do you do when you're up to "here" with the kids? When can you even get a break if you're not smoking? I used to use smoking as a way to sit down and rest and relax for 7 minutes several times a day. When I stopped smoking, I no longer had an excuse to sit and do nothing-- I expected myself to go, go, go all day long without stopping. After all, if I don't need to smoke, why should I stop working?  So with no way to bleed off stress, no excuse to step outside or have a seat and clear your mind for a few minutes, of course the desire to smoke is going to build. You don't really miss the nicotine per se, you miss having a ritual or a strategy to care for yourself and give yourself periodic relaxation breaks throughout the day. So the emotional pressure and frustration build up. Remembering the good things you associated with smoking build up. And the next thing you know, you accept an offered cigarette and BAM! you relapse. From "out of the blue" right? Wrong. The relapse had been building for weeks because you weren't paying attention to your inner needs or providing yourself any alternatives to cigarettes.
I couldn't agree with you more Chrys! I have mentioned before that I still have some sectioning of the day breaks, and at times have a long deep breathing session or two. I consider that my self care, as with it I just feel. So much happier in myself. I'm glad you like this video and thought it would perfectly tie in with your thread, and seemed to match your observations perfectly. Self care people... Self care!
This is also taken from his page. It informs us that most nicotine withdrawal is done by about 3 months, so hopefully that might help readers see that thoughts are coming from an emotional place, so you can take action on your self care. Withdrawal Symptoms Last? Nicotine is out of your body 72 hours after you quit smoking. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms usually reach their peak 2 to 3 days after you quit, and are gone within 1 to 3 months.1 It takes at least 3 months for your brain chemistry to return to normal after you quit smoking.2 The last two symptoms to go usually are irritability and low energy.   In summary, most people start to feel better after 1 week, and the symptoms are usually gone within 3 months.
This seems a very good place to post this videoI will keep watching  this. Thank you.                   
Just exactly what I need to read, the constant craves for the nicotine no matter where you are in your quit are the ones I need to overcome, my biggest problem is if they go on for days I get so frustrated, thinking OMG surely I should not be having these types of craves, surely it should be easier by now, but that is the problem, I allow that frustration to creep in and allow my thoughts to grow bigger and bigger until its all that fills my head, it drives me crazy, I really think I am going to go mad, so I give in, its so much easier to give in I think, ummm no because I really know that I do not want to smoke, its disgusting and it will kill me, but I do not summon the strength to overcome it.  I am going to dig just a little bit deeper and get the strength to overcome those annoying thoughts, the thoughts wont kill me in the long run, they may annoy me, but they will not kill me, the smoking will.  Thanks Crys, I needed to read this xxx
"In summary, most people start to feel better after 1 week, and the symptoms are usually gone within 3 months." Quote I look forward to 3 months!
Be careful, Tyme2B. The video/web site that Sharon linked to is about addictions in general, not about nicotine specifically. I can't speak for other drugs (thank heavens!) but you are not free of nicotine addiction within 3 months. At 3 months the symptoms are much, much better than they were after the first 3 weeks. The cravings, such as they are, are very infrequent and much weaker than they were. They are usually triggered by some event (i.e. holiday season or a new job) or a particular emotion (i.e., boredom, loneliness, stress, etc).  I'm not telling you this to discourage you. I believe that if you know what to expect you can be prepared for it and weather it more easily. You're doing great. You have already kept your quit through the worst days and things will gradually get easier and easier for you every day. But don't be surprised if every once in awhile you get hit with a strong desire for a cigarette many months after you quit. It happens to all of us. Don't freak out; it's not permanent.
I had strong craves today but just used the nicotine gum. It beats smoking! I want to get off the gum but I need a little more time. Without it I think I could have fallen off the train today. I have a stressful job....not to say most others do not...and I'm tired from sleep deprivation. It will pass. I just do one day at a time but look forward to no cravings :(
You're doing great, Thyme2B! You are really rocking this quit!  I think that it's perfectly OK to chew nicotine gum when you need to. It's much, MUCH preferable to smoking. Sipping on ice water and/or sucking on hard candy helps a lot to reduce cravings. However, in the long run you're going to want to develop strategies to reduce stress without resorting to the gum.  So before you reach for the gum try some other relaxation exercise first. Try 4-4-4 breathing (breathe in to the count of 4, hold for the count of 4, breathe out to the count of 4, repeat as necessary). Or go for a brisk walk for a few minutes. Listen to you favorite music or practice chair yoga at your desk for a few minutes (here's one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=barPap-8vnw&index=4&list=TLh0QnMG18cRn8iDlQfaS8V-6o89eCnLxv ). There are LOTS of ways to step back from the tensions of the day and calm yourself down. Try a couple of different ones and see which ones work best for you.
Thanks for that. Really enjoyed it.

I just do one day at a time but look forward to no cravings :( I'm glad that you're still on the train.  :) If you want to get rid of the cravings, you'll need to get rid of the nicotine gum because it's keeping you addicted and craving it.  You used it to stop puffing on cigarettes but being nicotine free is the only way to stop the cravings.  Nicotine is nicotine is nicotine.  We're all drug addicts and our drug of choice is nicotine.  Only one way to get over it and that is to break the cycle of constant withdrawal and supplying your body with the same drug that you're trying to free yourself from. Here's a couple of videos that are very relevant to what you're going through. 30 Years Of Nicotine GumNicotine gum has now been available for over 30 years. Video discusses the dismal success rate of this product as well as introducing materials explaining why all of the aids out there have done little in helping people to successfully stop smoking. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUtsVIdvaJo Nicotine Is Nicotine Is NicotineVideo discusses how nicotine delivered by any source via any route of administration has the full potential of causing relapse to any former smoker or user of any nicotine product. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KViTfIfHUv0 Keeping NRT In Case Of EmergencyVideo addresses the consequences of keeping a supply of any nicotine replacement product in the event of facing major or minor stress. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMRj1BlDTRw&app=desktop The Law Of Addiction"Administration of a drug to an addict will cause re-establishment of chemical dependence upon the addictive substance." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2I0NQVAg4I
Thanks Maryland...I hear you & I am trying to use regular gum now instead of the nicotine gum. Same flavour. And it usually works.  I guess I have been quitting smoking the same way I get into cold water....bit by bit instead of just jumping in with both feet all at once....and no question it is sure not as fast to adjust. It has kept me on the train but I know it has to stop & stop soon. You always have great advice 
I used to work at a bakery and this guy would come in lamenting how he could NOT get off the gum.  No matter what he tried he could not stop chewing (and he'd been chewing it for like 5 years or something).  He was literally always chewing it.  Crazy.
My husband has been chewing nicotine gum since he quit smoking 20 years ago. He's just absolutely miserable without some source of nicotine. At least nicotine has never been shown to cause cancer-- lots of other chemicals in cigarettes cause cancer but not the nicotine itself.
I was like that too that I thought I had to go go go because I no longer smoked.  Now I have to remind myself to take a break...funny how that works. 
This is exactly what I needed to read, exactly when I needed to read it. Romancing...thats exactly what I have been doing. Its exactly why I go back to smoking, time after time. Thank you Chrys. U may have just saved my quit!

Subtitle: The Romance Is Dead!  This is the time of year when many people quit smoking. Most especially, people who quit before but relapsed are trying again. I think that is wonderful (that they're coming back, not that they relapsed). Reading their posts has made me realize that in very many cases, people relapse because they are still romancing the cigarette. That means that they still WANT to smoke even though they know that smoking does nothing good for them. They still remember those quietly satisfying evenings on the deck smoking. They remember that a-a-a-h-h-h! of satisfaction with the first long draw on a cigarette. And they want that again. And so even if they are weeks or months into a quit-- even though the PHYSICAL addiction is long gone-- they essentially choose to go back to smoking because of the pull of these romantic fantasies about how good smoking was. Well, I was the poster child for romancing the cigarette. Throughout this quit and all my previous quits (of which there were several) I always wanted to smoke. I didn't smoke-- I controlled myself-- but I wanted to smoke. All the time. Almost every day. It seemed to me that after 4 or 5 months quit, almost everybody on the board was way done with smoking and happy about it. I still missed it. And that was frustrating because my rational brain KNEW that the "pleasure" of smoking was vastly over rated and mostly imaginary. I KNEW that I was romancing the cigarette and I really did not want to go back to smoking. But the seductive thoughts were there. Maybe not every day, but often enough to be very annoying. I'm here to tell you that today, more than 9 months after my quit, I realize that I am not desiring a cigarette hardly ever! This is a first for me. And this death of the romance is not just a matter of time-- I quit smoking before for periods of up to a year and still suffered from romancing. I think that the difference this time is that I educated myself about Nicodemon's lies. It's as though my rational brain has told my junkie brain over and over and over again "No, smoking is NOT pleasurable! And such small, brief pleasure as you feel when you smoke comes at way too great a cost! Forget it!" and finally, FINALLY junkie brain is quieting down. What a relief! Now I do admit that during these "romancing episodes" that I'm talking about-- those days when I really, really wanted a cigarette-- I had to remind myself over and over again about why I quit smoking in the first place and remind myself over and over again that I wanted to quit more than I wanted to smoke. I had to FIGHT to keep my quit many, many times over the months. The urge to smoke wasn't constant, but it was frequent. Sometimes it was quite miserable. I'm still jealous of people who seemed to have it easier than I did. I often thought that I was a "special snowflake" and I had it harder than other quitters-- few people admitted that they still wanted to smoke many months after a quit. But whether I had it worse than anyone else or not, I hung in there, reminded myself about why I quit, and that I was DETERMINED not to smoke.Now, at last, I can look back over the last few weeks and realize that the romance is dead. I finally, finally am at the point where I do think about smoking once in a while but it's like a vague thought that is easily dismissed, not a serious desire. I have heard others describe this "vague thought" phenomenon many months after a quit and I finally understand what they are talking about. So I guess I am writing this to say that if you are many weeks or months into a quit and you still want a cigarette, you are not alone. What you are experiencing is real. It does happen to some people (like me, for example). You are romancing the cigarette and you have to use your rational brain, your smoking education, and your strong desire to quit to fight the urge. And eventually, sooner or later, you will turn around one day and realize that the romance is dead. You really don't have to fight to keep your quit anymore-- you just have to remain vigilant and committed. Hang in there, folks!  You can DO this!  What an amazing 'writer' you are, Chrys!!! and if I could have "liked" this a 100 times, I would! lol! Strangely, prior to seeing this thread, I read MQ's blog? about being "in love" with a narcissist... so VERY pertinent!!!

I can't speak for other drugs (thank heavens!) but you are not free of nicotine addiction within 3 months. At 3 months the symptoms are much, much better than they were after the first 3 weeks.

But don't be surprised if every once in awhile you get hit with a strong desire for a cigarette many months after you quit. It happens to all of us. Don't freak out; it's not permanent.   OH SO TRUE!!!!  NONE of us, should misunderstand the "false sense of security" we get!!!! Once an addict, ALWAYS an addict!!!! and that's it!!! I STILL kick myself for the 1st 'relapse' after being "clean" for a year and half! (or more.. don't remember exactly!)There were no 'cravings' that I recall... plus, in those days, I smoked EVERYWHERE!!! (except bed!) Thank God, I'd moved during that glorious time, so at least when I did "start" (mental note to hit myself!!!) it was only on the balcony... but still!!! and for MONTHS I "had it under control"... (reminds me of my little brother GRHS, and his heroine addiction) anyway, it got worse and worse, till I practically LIVED on the balcony at times! Have quit, like you Chrys, MANY times between then and now, but this has lasted the longest (since my 1st, I mean!!!)but I'm NOT being lulled into that FALSE sense of security!!! oh no!!!  My point being, smoking, heroine, crack, booze, whatever the addiction, it's STILL AN ADDICTION!!!! "My name's Ria and I'm an addict" Love and peace to you ALL!!! xox xox xox
I have been smoke free for a long time now. I stopped counting after half a year. I have to say that I still get lets call them "memories of smoking". I started when I was a teenager so i smoked through the interesting period of my life. Now that I do something, like travel, l do get a feeling that "yeah, i used to go outside for an arrival cigarette". Nicotine withdrawal is long gone but even in the long run you still will get flash backs from time to time. That's why motivation is so important. I quit many times, before I realized that i need some foundation. Now I always say, that relapse is not a big problem but before resuming smoke free life you have to think hard on why you relapsed. I used to relapse because "i had a stressful day", I thought that smoking calms me. Only by truly understanding that smoking does not calm me that I was able to stop smoking - once realization came I didn't need to quit, I just stopped.  I am repeating myself because that "It calms me" was what I believed and a lot of smokers do believe. The moment you stop smoking withdrawal begins and by smoking again you are just temporarily eliminating withdrawal symptoms thus perpetuating this circle of misery. By the way, for me last symptom was high energy. Weather permitting I was on a bicycle every day burning that extra energy and aggressiveness :D _______________________________
The contents of my last ashtray went into a jar that I half-filled with water.  I keep it screwed tightly shut for obvious reasons. A couple of times when I have had "cravings" for a smoke that tested my resolution, I unscrewed the lid and took a good long sniff of what I've been missing. That subtle and complex bouquet of fragrance that I might otherwise refer to as Satan's kimchi.     This is the "ROMANCE" of smoking.
Yes, nicotine is out of system very quickly and withdrawal symptoms are actually are a great and wonderful things.  That is your body adjusting itself to run on higher grade fuel in front of your eyes. You can feel yourself improving and if you understand what it is it stops being negative and becomes a very positive thing.  Staying the course is a question of did you "quit" or did you "stop smoking". If you feel that not smoking is a struggle - you have to look at the reason why you feel this way.  I am guessing you are quitting for a reason so now look at why you feel that being smoke free is something you have to work on. What is it that you think smoking was giving you positive. Smoking is a self sustaining purely negative habit. All other habits have at least one "positive"feature. Smoking has none.  So to stay the course you need to explore what you think you would gain from smoking and clearly understanding that you will NOT get this from a cigarette.Edited January 30, 2016 by MarylandQuitterAdvertising
I found this post from RobF about relapse,"Don't Be Silly, Stay Quit"
The romance also died for me. For the past month or so tobacco means nothing to me and i can see people smoking without the ohhh feeling. Finally! Im free. Now, dear Stewie, do not screw it up. Thanks Stewie.

Faaabuuuluuuusssss.... High five !!! Indead. When i joined the forum 3 months ago the smokes where a crucial part of my fantasies. Now, i barely care. Im winning! High five mommy!
Someone mentioned three months can be tricky and unfortunately I must agree..... figured hey instead of cigarette I will smoke a cigar ok well that was still stupid. I need to remind myself NO I WILL NOT SMOKE A CIGAR that is no better.... I don't want throat cancer. 
Don't over think..3 months...it's no different to the months passed..if you want to it to be bad..it will be..Think nice positive thoughts ..eg..three months fabulous...Smoke a cigar???..oh wow..what a stink that would be..read more here..Smoking will kill you...
I re-read Allan Carr's Easyway this past week, as I've been struggling with smoking/not smoking and just want to be free. I still felt like I needed that cigarette to fulfill something. I also find it difficult to stick to my word of "nope" when I still fantasize about wanting a cigarette. So this post is the beginning of my journey (again)! I can say all I want that I am going to happily be a non-smoker for the rest of my life - but I actually have to believe it. I do believe it this time. However, I am still a little skeptical that the easyway can work for me... I have bookmarked several pages of the book to help me stay committed this time. I have so much to look forward to as a non-smoker. 
hford - good for you to search deep inside yourself and ask the tough question; "how badly do I want this?". Once you answer that and you decide you want a smoke free life badly enough, all you need then is personal commitment. You know the drill by now. You know what you're facing. It's the same thing all of us face when we quit. Educating yourself about the addiction, keeping a positive mindset throughout your quit and sheer determination through the initial days will get you there. It may not be pleasant but it will work and it will be worth it. You, like us, will see that those difficult days won't last that long. Take it in small bits at first. Hours turn into days, days to weeks etc. YOU can do it :)
What are thoughts on herbal tobacco??Logic tells me its not a good idea...the action of smoking, inhaling smoke and possibly nicotine in herbal tobacco as well?? 
Herbal cigarettes...It's still putting something in your mouth ,and setting fire to it...Your lungs are still taking in smoke.. Some of those herbs are just as deadly when set on fire..Much safer to cut a straw ,the same size as a cigarette and puff on this...Good clean fresh air...I'm sure our lungs will be very grateful..Although ..I didn't do either !!!!!I wanted to rid myself of the whole ...hand to mouth..addiction...
Yes, they are still full of tar & toxins. Still smoke in the lungs
In my experience as a 2+ pack smoker for 22 yrs, it's easier longer term to not 'romance'. I know what it's like to be a smoker, and it's not a romance. I never had the ability to go 4 hrs without a smoke. I think people who exercised some degree of self-control over their smoking habit have it more difficult over the long term. I know damn well when I'm a smoker, I'm smoking and that train has one throttle position. So there is no love lost. Smoking is 5 mins of pleasure and then 25 million wasted minutes before I build up the commitment to quit again. I just have to remember that while quitting wasn't that hard, building up the commitment to quit took me 7 yrs this last time. Finding the commitment is key to me. I found it this year. I have quit and I can't cheapen it's importance again.
Great post, Sam. This has been a tough year for me but the one good thing has been that I've also found my commitment to quitting and staying quit in May of this year and I know it will get even easier with time and fortunately time is all I've got- to commit to this quit and to a healthier life overall.
Hi samw and welcome to the QT :) I'm glad you have found that commitment you were looking for! You're right, quitting without total commitment makes the battle that much harder to win. I also found that once I truly started to believe that smoking never did anything positive for me and only enslaved me in a cycle of feeding a deadly addiction, it made things much easier for me to just push aside any urges to smoke. I know why I smoked all those years and now, I know I was just horribly uninformed about what smoking really is. There's a lot of good info. on this site and support too. We have all been there so we truly do understand what it's like to quit. All the best to you sam.
Hello and welcome Sam...We are all one cig ..away from a pack..Take smoking off the table ...no matter what...If you romance one...then you might as well romance the thousands to follow..There is tons of helpful stuff to read here...Take your seat ..and enjoy the ride...
Welcome abroad! Glad you've decided to join us & even happier that you have the opportunity! I've heard many times we are only 1 puff from the next 1000 or so! Everyday I Have to Stop myself from that one or so puffs! It isn't going to solve anything, calm me, fix me or anybody else & definitely won't change anything but make my health worse & change my status from non smoker to smoker! I choose to be a non smoker & deny myself self destruction w/cigarettes today!  I hope you decide to stay w/us for a joyful journey! Go ahead & enjoy the ride! We are here to stay free from the awful addiction caused by lighting up, chewing, or any other form of tobacco! Please join us, we have many great days ahead!
For sure. Up to 20 days! I've taken to nic-free vapor when having beers, but didn't use it to quit which I think is important. I like it though, it gives me an alternative for the long term to help me stay quit... But it's not addictive at all. I forget my vaporizer I hardly notice. I'm 40, I don't ever see me going back ever again. I have one more big hurdle on labor day and I have to finish the book I'm reading on quitting,  and I know I have to respect the addiction for the rest of my life. there's no chance I go back.
Good for you Sam...you sound positive ...Many roads lead to Rome...just get your ass there...that's the main thing....Day by day..this is how its done..labor day..is...just another day...no big deal....Onwards...
So very tru dat!!  Well done that woman.....     Wishing you a peaceful Christmas, and a Brave New Year....  
    Very encouraging words in this thread. Thank you all.
Well I made it 6 months without a smoke Truth be told I had 3 cigarettes in a row a few weeks ago at about 1 am. I was out drinking one night with a group of people I rarely hang out with.. so it gave me opportunity. I kinda rationalized it as my free New Years cheat, which I had thought about granting myself. But I didn't smoke on New Years or any other time in the last 6 months. They do say you can do that (reward if you earn it sort of thing) on diets, obvs I would not recommend it here.         I'll just reiterate.. not worth it. It only takes 1 for the cracks to start in your 'quit' psyche. I have noticed more urges since then. I still have absolute resolve, so its not that bad. Its been 3 weeks, hell I had beers the next night and didn't smoke. But I had almost forgotten to think about smoking until I had those. Even around friends who smoke, it's like I'll hang. I have 0 desire.      it's not ever worth cheating, it's like a crack in glass. You seriously weaken your mindset and have to start filling in the cracks again. I kinda understood this going in, but it totally reinforced by belief. People fail because they allow moments where they can cheat and that is impossible to stop the train once it starts going too fast. Edited January 26, 2018 by samw
    Thank you Same...for coming back and updating us on your quit...    We have to make sure our brains understand ...we are nicotine addicts...like any other addict ,there is no such thing as ..just one !!!!    Congrats on getting back on the train...stay in your seat... Buckle up...let's make this your sticky quit !!!!
    Come on back samw! There’s a seat on the train for you! 
One is too many and a carton is not enough.     I swear, nicotine should be a schedule one drug.  Right up there with heroin             Edited January 26, 2018 by Octain
I find myself romancing the cigarette too, sometimes, and since my quit is only 17 days old it's a dangerous feeling.       What helped was to go to the dentist and have a deep cleaning done. It was way over-due and I've been putting it off for a solid year!      It took 7 shots of novacaine and three and a half hours because they also replaced a bunch of metal fillings with ceramic ones.  After that experience (which was really a positive one despite all the dread and fear I had about mouth shots and drills) I don't want to foul my mouth up again with disgusting smoke.  The other side of my smile is going to be done in two weeks but now I feel like I'm so much cleaner.      I also got an hour long massage last week with the money I've saved from not smoking.
    No more stinky breath ,yellow teeth furry tongue...oh yes your mouth is so much nicer...    Why would you spoil all that....nooooo..... Aww a nice massage too...already you are gaining the lovely rewards...and they keep on coming ...enjoy them ....x
    I recommend keeping substitutions on hand for those cravings.

And that was frustrating because my rational brain KNEW that the "pleasure" of smoking was vastly over rated and mostly imaginary. I KNEW that I was romancing the cigarette and I really did not want to go back to smoking. But the seductive thoughts were there. Maybe not every day, but often enough to be very annoying.                                        I'm here to tell you that today, more than 9 months after my quit, I realize that I am not desiring a cigarette hardly ever! This is a first for me. And this death of the romance is not just a matter of time-- I quit smoking before for periods of up to a year and still suffered from romancing.                                      I think that the difference this time is that I educated myself about Nicodemon's lies. It's as though my rational brain has told my junkie brain over and over and over again "No, smoking is NOT pleasurable! And such small, brief pleasure as you feel when you smoke comes at way too great a cost! Forget it!" and finally, FINALLY junkie brain is quieting down. What a relief!                                     Now I do admit that during these "romancing episodes" that I'm talking about-- those days when I really, really wanted a cigarette-- I had to remind myself over and over again about why I quit smoking in the first place and remind myself over and over again that I wanted to quit more than I wanted to smoke. I had to FIGHT to keep my quit many, many times over the months. The urge to smoke wasn't constant, but it was frequent. Sometimes it was quite miserable.                                     I'm still jealous of people who seemed to have it easier than I did. I often thought that I was a "special snowflake" and I had it harder than other quitters-- few people admitted that they still wanted to smoke many months after a quit. But whether I had it worse than anyone else or not, I hung in there, reminded myself about why I quit, and that I was DETERMINED not to smoke.                                        Now, at last, I can look back over the last few weeks and realize that the romance is dead. I finally, finally am at the point where I do think about smoking once in a while but it's like a vague thought that is easily dismissed, not a serious desire. I have heard others describe this "vague thought" phenomenon many months after a quit and I finally understand what they are talking about.                                                         So I guess I am writing this to say that if you are many weeks or months into a quit and you still want a cigarette, you are not alone. What you are experiencing is real. It does happen to some people (like me, for example). You are romancing the cigarette and you have to use your rational brain, your smoking education, and your strong desire to quit to fight the urge. And eventually, sooner or later, you will turn around one day and realize that the romance is dead. You really don't have to fight to keep your quit anymore-- you just have to remain vigilant and committed.                                      Hang in there, folks!  You can DO this!                 bump,  you may want to read through the three pages of this post, it is really helpful
    Excellent post and excellent video...            
    I was going through this exact thing last night. I had an hour long drive and a playoff game. I was so nervous as it was my first one. I thought there was no way I would get through it without smoking. I even texted a friend and told her I was done. I could not wait to smoke that first one and feel that buzz from it after having not smoked for a few days. It's so irrational and I even said to my friend, I know that in the long run my nerves will be better not smoking and I won't be playing a match and waiting for my chance to smoke, I can more easily concentrate on what I am doing.        Well, I didn't stop and I made it through without having a smoke and I even won!!! I even had a couple of beers. I was supposed to meet up with some friends after but I decided to just go home because they were at a smoking bar. I had enough for one night...
This is fantastic ST! And, you called it right when you said;    "I know that in the long run my nerves will be better not smoking and I won't be playing a match and waiting for my chance to smoke, I can more easily concentrate on what I am doing."     YES! This is exactly it! See your quit through the tough and uncertain early days and you will be rewarded like you can't imagine. Freedom to enjoy whatever you are into without having to worry about the addiction's seductive call. Soon you will be happy to say: Piss Off I'm busy living my life!Edited July 13, 2018 by reciprocity
Next time a craving plunks down on your face ask yourself, "What price are you willing to pay to own yourself?"Edited July 26 by Siriusgrammar, grammar, grammar
    Don’t “romance” the cigarette. Addiction wants you to believe that you cannot control your thoughts. This is absolutely incorrect. You have direct control of your thoughts.    You absolutely CAN control what you think.      Cravings always go away. No matter how bad you want, the cravings always go away.    If you don’t give into that craving, it makes you even that much stronger.     Just keep in mind, the cravings always go away.         Cigarettes do nothing for you.      They take away your time, your money and you health.
The last cigaret I had was 2 years ago. Wow, couldn`t even imagine how much time has passed. I will lie to say I didn`t want to smoke after quitting, I think everybody here understands this. I have tried a lot of different ways to quit. I have read a lot on Vapingdaily about quitting methods like "cold turkey" or replacing cigarettes. I understood I can`t do it fast.   I moved to vaping with liquids that contain nicotine and every month I reduced the quantity of nicotine in my liquids. I don`t smoke/vape now and really happy my family has always supported me with this big problem. Because I understood I couldn`t control my addiction anymore.   Every time I want to smoke and remember this process I think how much money I had saved) Maybe this can help you too) Edited September 30, 2018 by rmayersLink to vaping site removed.

Most especially, people who quit before but relapsed are trying again. I think that is wonderful (that they're coming back, not that they relapsed).                                        Reading their posts has made me realize that in very many cases, people relapse because they are still romancing the cigarette. That means that they still WANT to smoke even though they know that smoking does nothing good for them. They still remember those quietly satisfying evenings on the deck smoking. They remember that a-a-a-h-h-h! of satisfaction with the first long draw on a cigarette. And they want that again. And so even if they are weeks or months into a quit-- even though the PHYSICAL addiction is long gone-- they essentially choose to go back to smoking because of the pull of these romantic fantasies about how good smoking was.                                     Well, I was the poster child for romancing the cigarette. Throughout this quit and all my previous quits (of which there were several) I always wanted to smoke. I didn't smoke-- I controlled myself-- but I wanted to smoke. All the time. Almost every day.

    Bump.
Thank you Chrysalis,  I too have relapsed,  and was so envious of people who seemed to find it a lot easier than me. In one way I learnt more about myself the 2nd time around, but was searching for the reasons why in the end. Romancing is and was definitely on my agenda, I will need to create a different romance picture, at the moment I love my sweet little dog, and I sing and dance to her a lot. This will do for now because I am changing my eating behaviour once again (no cakes) this is a mental problem too. I am sure if I keep on reading and learning and listening I will be guilt free and continue to be smoke free too.

Any thoughts are the LIES of addiction. We've heard and thought them all until we chose to control our thoughts and leave addiction in the dust.Red Flags   You must be merciless in this and leave no room, no room at all for relapse.        I am concerned, forestgreen...you often speak of the romance of nicotine.   What is romancing you ?  What remains enticing ?  What do you think you are missing ?
    When you totally understand this addiction ,when you see how the Big Tabacco Companies ..work so hard  to make sure we ..the poor smokers stay hooked for life ...  There is nothing left to Romance ..... poison......they have been poisoning us .... It's so slowly we are unaware.....it's only when are bodies carnt cope with it anymore ....it develops a chronic illness most of them fatal...  COPD is nothing to Romance ..trust me .....you really don't want to have this in your life ....
    I didn't realize I was romancing the cigarette, or that I am missing something, I am glad the cigarette is out of my life, I used to romance it, but then so did a lot of people on the movies in particular. I think my thoughts are mostly on trying to loose weight now, and this might be me romancing "my cake" I am missing my cake but I have devised a new Mantra for this.  Called I love savoury eats, not sweet eats.   I don't know how long this will last, but it might sink into my brain soon if I say it often enough. I can remember giving up sugar in my coffee and tea a very long time (decades) ago and was quite miserable for a while. Thanks for caring

I'm 16....right now I'm a teen, i'm having fun.  I enjoy smoking.  I can quit at any time.  So, I'll quit when...... I'm 20.. but life is a little stressful right now...I have 2 babies, working full time..saving to buy  a house....I'm still young and won't be affected long term by this smoking...no big deal...right?  I'll quit definitely by the time... I'm 25.....still a lot of my family and friends still smoke...they seem to be okay.  That must mean I'll be ok..My parents both smoked for years and they are both still healthy and vibrant...look at all these people outside..taking a smoke break with me...we are all ok right??? I'm 30.....starting to get a little nervous...my dad quit, my sister quit, handful of friends are jumping ship,.  I've had 15+ years of smoking now and fear is creeping in a little.  Fear of quitting..and never enjoying life as I know it...and  fear of never quitting and suffering a horrible disease and feeling the effects of smoking.  Time to dig that hole in the sand deeper and put my head in there...I'll quit when... I'm 36..Dad is diagnosed...Stage 4 lung cancer..inoperable.   :blink:  :(  My smoking has now doubled!  I know...he's dying and I'm smoking more...what is wrong with me?  As dad lie in a coma taking his last breaths...I whispered in his ear "I promise daddy, I'm going to quit smoking".  I purchased a copy of Allen Carr's easyway to quit smoking and I did it...I quit smoking!!  Yay me!!!! :)  3 months later...I start getting restless...cravings are coming left and right...I read the book again but the words aren't jumping out at me like they did when I first read it...I felt like I was losing my mind.  I looked at the back of the book and called a number they listed as support...It was in London.  The book was old and the number was for the publishing company, not a support line.  I was losing my strength...and ultimately relapsed. :(  I will probably be a smoker for life....I can't do this again.... The next 8 years are a blurr....that book remained on my shelf collecting dust--every once in a while I would glance at it with guilt and say...some day...maybe in the spring when it's nice out, maybe the summer, maybe the fall, after christmas,...new years resolution, after my birthday....ok..after spring again..one excuse after another. I was smoking more than ever. I did quit a few times during that time...few days or weeks..only to smoke again...always started with one puff.   Finally...at the age of 44...after all that struggle, relapse, disappointment, denial, and thousands of excuses....I finally picked up that book..knowing this was it...I was either going to quit for good this time...or I was going to remain a smoker till my death.  I knew I just didn't have another quit in me otherwise.  I can't keep going through the torture of quitting over and over..it's exhausting..and the pain from relapse is too distressing.   So, my final quit began.  Only this time...I knew that the quitting journey was a roller coaster and even though I feel strong in my quit one day...doesn't mean I will still feel that way the next.  I proved that on my last quit.  I Googled quit smoking support and got it.  Best thing I ever did to ensure that I would never smoke again.  I introduced myself and became a member.   Point of the story is....time moves so quickly..and the excuses are just that....excuses.  Before you know it...nearly 30 years have gone by.  The best time to quit is TODAY....tomorrow has a way of always being that carrot that dangles out in front of you...never able to reach it.  Addictions are design to hook you for life.   I do wish I quit sooner, I do wish I never smoked.  But wishing for something that is in the past,  is a waste of time.  The only thing I can change is what I do from now on. My quality of life is so much better today.  I am healthier, happier, and confident.  I have quite a smoking history and am full aware it may come back to bite me in the ass...however I will not die a smoker chained to addiction.  No matter what.  I am free.   If you are reading this and still smoking, please.....sign up...join today.  Read all the information here and in the blog and educate yourself about nicotine addiction. Don't just read once..read again and again and again until you "get it". You will never regret that you quit smoking but there is plenty of regret when you don't.    Quit today....no more excuses.
Brilliant post...as you say no more excuses,  folk will ALWAYS find an excuse to smoke....stop looking, start quitting.
Babs - I am sure that your Dad would be so proud of you - your little ones too. Fantastic post. Thank you.
^^^TRUTH^^^   Brilliant post...as you say no more excuses, folk will ALWAYS find an excuse to smoke....stop looking, start quitting.Ditto
Babs that was an excellent story.  I enjoyed reading it and you are right- "no more excuses".
thanks for that babs x NO MORE EXCUSES - PERIOD! and so say all of us......
No more excuses :)
now if I can only be as consistent with my exercise regime... no more excuses :)
That was just a great post and I agree your Dad would be proud I bet.  
Babs what a truly great read, and you are so right, no more excuses, otherwise another 2 or 5 or 10 years will have passed and before you know it its too late, WHAT IF and WHY DIDN'T I can't turn the clock back.  Your dad would be proud of the strength you have
Wow, great post. Pisses me off that I waited so long to finally quit. 
Awesome, out of the park! No more excuses. Carrot and stick? No matter how hard you run, you'll never get the carrot. That's what the stick is for, to beat ourselves up with. Love the post!
We live to make excuses for ourselves. Being accountable is something we all struggle with. I have watched people with COPD and emphysema struggle to breathe, yet they continue to smoke, convincing themselves that they NEED their fix; that they possibly couldn't quit, even if they tried. I watched and heard my mom suffer for the last few years of her life. The doctors told her she NEEDED to quit to save her life. She didn't and now she's gone at 59.  All of these are excuses.. lies we tell ourselves to make us feel okay about smoking. But it's not okay, because time does go fast. It's not worth it!  Value your life. Give yourself more time with your loved ones. You never know how much time you actually have, so appreciate every moment you have. No more excuses. :)
Excellent post! 
awesome post babs, I can relate to so much of it ... thanks for the reminder 
Bumping for our guests who are still on the fence about quitting.  No more excuses smokers...quit now!  You'll be glad you did!!!
Oh Babs....wonderful post! Today is Easter...look at the kids running around playing in your yard...do you want them to remember you as a smoker who just couldn't quit...not even for them? I smoked for 35 years....I quit 2+ months ago........IF I can do it...so can you!
Great post babs....I have 52 years of excuses......How many times did I say ....I'll quit tomorrow.......far too any....
Awesome post, babs, you described a whole lot of us, I just bet ya!  When I was a young teen, I figured I'd quit when I was 20, then I hit 20 and said 30, at 30 do you know how stupid I was??? I said I didn't need to quit because there would be "a cure" for lung cancer before I ever got it... the junkie mind has no rhyme or reason. I'm so proud of the young people that I see who are quitting nowadays... they seem to get younger and younger too; instead of being 50+ I'm seeing so many people 20+, 30+, etc.
bumping for any guests :)
Bumping your bump...great post Babs.
What a wonderful post, Babs! You said it well... fantastic! I'm so proud of you!
This is an awesome post!  So very true, we were all going to quit weren't we...I never intended to smoke as long as I did.  I thought I would quit when I had children.  Not so much.
Smoking is one of the hardest things to quit. I have tried at least 25 times, but in times of stress I go back. i HAVE to quit! Hardly anyone I know smokes anymore and some have died because of it !Welcome to the board, luckypoo!  So glad you found us.  You've joined a big group of quitters.  Would you please start a thread in Introductions and tell us a little bit about you and your quit?
Great post Babs.  I can't believe I almost smoked for 30 years.
I can't believe I smoked for 20.  I so identified myself by the addiction, and I didn't like myself too much.
Awesome post ... so well written and so true - I'm sure we all can relate to the "excuses"...  I was 12 when I started and 61 when I quit!!!!  I think I know all the excuses there are.Loving my life now :)
That was a great post. I´m sure your dad´s proud of you. We all are! 
EXCELLENT post Babs! I could relate so much to this, especially about making a promise to dad that you'd quit...so did I.
Today I will quit smoking, started when I was 12 I am 49 now. Through my smoking career I only quit once and that was for two years. I have a beautiful wife and two beautiful children and I feel like I'm Throwing It All Away with smoking and depriving my kids of my presence because I'm always looking for a place to go hide and smoke and an opportunity. Smoked quite a bit this morning, I drove by and through it all cigarette related items. Wrote down some things on paper to keep me motivated and just joined this site looking for any piece of help from anyone. Wish me luck no more excuses!

Beautiful post. Im 26 years old and quitting an 8 year addiction but already regretting ever taking it. I did nothing with my life when i was a smoker. But i have yet so much life ahead, i dont want to smoke again. Right now its a daily struggle fighting the cigarette romance, i really miss it i enjoyed it a lot or so i think. But ill not go down without a fight. NOPE!
Sazerac, thank you for reposting Babs' story. This post is so powerful it scares the crap out of me. I've read it over & over. I have smoked for 40 years. I WILL make this my final quit. I want to live & more so I want to live a good quality of life. Coughing, fear, months & years of promises to myself, the stench of cigarette smoke in my hair & on my clothes, hiding my dirty little secret....NO MORE! I WANT TO BE FREE! And only I can make that happen for myself. It's a choice but it's a necessity of a healthy lifesyle choice. And that power post makes me all the more determined to succeed. I CAN, I WILL. My personal pledge to Freedom.
I am almost  49 now...and happier than I have ever been! Loving my freedom! NO MORE EXCUSES!!
Good read. Missed this or forgot itI lived this but threw away a few more quits in there.  Now how about one and the kinky creature you are now.  16 backseat and bat got nervous, jumped in front and talked to you18 same car but burrito couldn't figure out the steering wheel on the correct side. Never left driveway18-45. Good girl46 saw 50 shades and tied up meathead. Wasn't very attractive man so drove the car into a lake and left him47 Bakon went by on his bike. What a ripped hunk and got his own restraints49. Celibate for two years now. Once you have bakon the rest is just old beef   Waiting on his return.
Lol. You are a trip bakon. What an imagination.  I love it!!   Love your stories and in all of them....we are always smoke free. 
Babs, your post is inspiring &I I need to keep reminding myself of the cold hard facts. I just smoked my last cigarette damn it! 62 yrs old , & I want to be strong as I can in my old age down the line. Everyone in my senior housing community smokes &a they look &I act so old gosh darn I want more for my later yrs than that. If something takes me down it's not gonna be by my own hand!  God knows the irreversible damage I've already done to my body but maybe I'll get sone of my healthy feeling back for my body.

Joybella - You can start feeling a lot better and improve your quality of life in your senior years but only if you have the commitment to Never Take Another Puff. You know that one cig. even one puff, will lead you right back to where you are now. We are all nicotine addicts and the only avenue of escape is to quit for good. You have made that decision and with the support of your new friends here on this site, you will be able to do this. It won't be easy, especially in the beginning but it will get better with time and it will be so worth while for you. Let's do this together starting now. One day at a time. One hour at a time when necessary even 1 minute at a time. You CAN do it but, you MUST commit to not smoking; not even one puff, Not One Puff Ever; that's the NOPE daily pledge. Make that pledge daily and refocus yourself daily by doing that. Wist you well Joybella. We are here to cheer you on and support you all the way!
Welcome aboard joybella..I'm roughly your age...a 52 year smoker...it's never too late to quit...it might feel uncomfortable at the beginning..but wow...the beniefts far out weigh this...I feel better now than I did 20 hear ago..Make a decision never to smoke another one ..ever...read everything you can here...Post daily..

You people are great. So much support. All you tell me gives me hope & so much more confidence that I can do this. Big nope Today. For sure I do have a 14 mg patch on but I don't think I'll need them for long. Cooking healthy soup today &I can find plenty to do around my apt to keep busy. Also I gotta remember to keep socializing as I tend to become a hermit while going thru this & I read last night that is a sign of relapse. GOD FORBID. I got Jesus right here with me too

Well done...one day at a time...don't think beyond this...Keep busy...don't let your junkie brain win...NOPE !!!
Glad to hear this Joybella. You're determination sounds just right. Like Doreensfree said, one day at a time. Don't overthink it, just don't smoke. We're all cheering you on ..... Go Girl!!
That was wonderful. Very moving and awesome of you to put out. Good job. Let's hope it moves a lot of people to join us and continues to help us stay strong. I know it was a help to me this a.m.  "Whether you think you can, or you think you can't-------you're right".  Henry Ford.
I definitely relate to that Babs, I'm 45, I wish I quit sooner but I didn't and now have more consequences to deal with from smoking. If I continue smoking it will only get worse.
Why does our brain or mind or sub conscience tell us to go ahead and just have one cig? Is it the addiction talking?  
^^^  Yes, it is the addiction. It is a strong addiction and it is very crafty but you CAN beat it and already are by coming here and educating yourself about the addiction. Your addiction wants to be fed nicotine. It can't get that unless it convinces YOU to take a cigarette, put it in your mouth and light it so .... YOU have ALL the control here. You also know from reading here and maybe other places too that "just one" is a lie!! It's not possible. Just ask anyone who has relapsed. 1 cigarette or 1 puff - doesn't matter. It feeds the nicotine back into your body and awakens the addiction again making it stronger and you weaker. Don't ever believe what that voice is telling you! Read your list of reasons for quitting and stay strong. That voice will eventually get weaker and weaker - that's a promise!!
When a stupid craving comes, or dumb thoughts about how "great" smoking was and how I miss as it, I've been visualizing this:The  nicodemon, a small, roundish, ogre-like creature who has taken up residence in my belly since May 20th, is crying out for attention. I unceremoniously club him over the head. Hard. He sputters, "ouch!" shakes his head and looks weaker and goofier after every clubbing. (He's looking REALLY rough of late- has taken quite a beating over the last month.).  Anyway, that's what I've been doing and it also provides some comic relief to the situation. After all, if you can laugh about something, it really has no power over you whatsoever.  "Nic" is in for quite a surprise this weekend though... Monday morning I'm having a colonoscopy (my virgin voyage into this brand of deep, intense self-care).  For those who have already gone this route or know someone who has, you'll be aware that Sunday will be a day of liquid diet followed by a systematic cleansing of the plumbing at the rear of my personal abode. As such, "Nic" will be losing his place of residence in my belly and will end up you-know-where... to be flushed away for good.  Oh yeah... Monday's the day...
It's that little nico monster trying to lure you back in..its the drug,S nature ..the only way to kill it..Is to starve it until it dies..There is NO such thing as !! Just One !!...we are addicts..Once you introduce the drug back into your body.. The monster will be reborn..he will want more..until your back to square one...Starve him out...he's on his way out...x
Ugh. I have to reset my timer. I have been writing in my journal for about a month about how this or that cig will be my last... and then... It never is. Ive been lying to myself, giving in to what my addiction wants. I wrote myself a letter in my journal about how all I have ever wanted is to be free. I know I can do it, but I need to be stronger than my little desire or craving. Besides, it is not me who wants it, it's the nic  monster.
So, where are you hford? Is the nicodemon having it's way with you?Come back to where people who care about your future well being are waiting to support you in your quit journey. Choose life - not death!
Thanks Babs....   I started smoking when I was 12,  I quit the first time when I was 59....   Just gone sixty now and am determined this will be my sticky quit!     Cigarettes were never the anchors in our lives that hold us steady....  they were the ropes that kept us tied to the dock while life sailed by! - jwgIt is not because you quit...it is because you smoked.  It will pass! -  NancyEdited December 25, 2017 by OldybutmouldyChanged important bits to red text!

    I just read this again. Thank you, Babs, for writing it and please know how much it helps.
this is my 12th day of not smoking went to a bar 50 people smoking had a few drinks and I went home this is also about self control of course I'm addicted but I don't have to give into it today
    WTG, Boater!  Yes, you can have whatever kinds of feelings you may have but you don't have to act upon them.  Your job now is to keep that quit till the quit keeps you. (Hey, I like that one!)
    I don't look at this being that difficult they're not shooting at me

I did quit a few times during that time...few days or weeks..only to smoke again...always started with one puff.                                     Finally...at the age of 44...after all that struggle, relapse, disappointment, denial, and thousands of excuses....I finally picked up that book..knowing this was it...I was either going to quit for good this time...or I was going to remain a smoker till my death.

Only this time...I knew that the quitting journey was a roller coaster and even though I feel strong in my quit one day...doesn't mean I will still feel that way the next. I proved that on my last quit. I Googled quit smoking support and got it. Best thing I ever did to ensure that I would never smoke again.

    Thank you for this....This could totally be me.  I've ridden the same roller coaster and when my mom was diagnosed with Gastric cancer I started smoking more and here I am a year and a half after her death realizing that I have to do it today.  There's always an excuse, bargaining.  I'm gonna be stronger this time!  I will definitely come back to read this in my times of weakness.

The people that are here, water, pretzels, twizzlers, cranberry juice, sleep, sleep, sleep, solitude, a pillow to scream into, talking to my mom about what I was going through (She is 5 years quit this month!), my treadmill.Oh and cookies. I rode the wave often.
Deep breathing, reading and posting here, scrubbing the stale smoke smell out of my house, more deep breathing, reminding myself of why I quit in the first place, more reading and posting here, thinking to myself "Just 5 more minutes. Just 5 more minutes. Just 5 more minutes...." more deep breathing, napping, more reading and posting here... [i think you got the picture. :) ]
Allen Carr audible helped me.  Exercise, however much you can do can 'fill the void.'Repeating to myself that smoking was just flat off the table, to avoid inner debate.
After smoking for so long my body went berserk...I stayed with the board sometimes nearly 24hours a day....sleep no chance....I read I read,and then I read some more....I recieved so much support,I would  never have made it on my own.....Shouting aloud the slogans....not sticking anything in my mouth and setting fire to it...My I pod.....singing to my music...If I can quit ,anyone can....
Run. Not long - 5 minutes - as long as smoking the cigarette would have taken... as fast as you can keep it up for 5 minutes. Guaranteed you won't want a smoke for quite a while afterword. Want to kill the craves for all day? Go on a 10-miler.   Easy Peasy

I mainly looked at non smoking cats and dogs. ... Seriously .
Keeping busy doing anything but mainly  cleaning. I really didn't sit down much. Chewing straws. Drinking water. Going on walks. Gum and strawberry candies. Reading message boards. 
Had man flu and chest infection for the first couple of weeks of my quit - so there was a lot of sleep involved... Then moved onto chewing regular menthol gum, reading and writing on the board, and doing projects around the house - honestly, I have no idea where I found the time to smoke!! ETA - Sally, great idea btw ;)
Deep breathing, chewing gum, cleaning, reading, logging on here every 5 mins to reassure myself I wasn't going mad, and telling myself NOPE even if it was every few seconds, and leaning on you lovely lovey people, wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you xxx
I kept log on other site. Got it in signature over there.NOPE.   Said it again and again.

No problems so far, son in hospital with broken hand. Getting surgery now, so just sitting around watching people walk by carrying their oxygen. Easy."  Me? I spent the first days in a fever induced semi coma, and the chest hurt to much to choke down more than a puff or two. The vape pipe was making me gag. After I sorta came to I lived on the forums and read the literature. The joel videos were my favorite. Read the Allan Carr book right off the bat.
Stay busy.... don't dwell.
Thank you Everybody It was interesting to see what worked for so many successful quits. We need to bottle that stuff up... S
At the beginning:  Attitude was my biggest weapon: I do not smoke anymore! Also used nicorette gum for the first week or two to help with cravings!  NOW: Attitude is still my biggest weapon: I do not smoke anymore!  IN THE FUTURE: Attitude is going to be my biggest weapon: I do not smoke anymore!
I also decided to drink tea which I never did before. I bought different kinds and fussed around with tea things during my break at work. It really helped me to have something to do other than go outside and smoke. ...today I had an orange tea at about 11:00 . Good to give me "some thing" until lunch
Walking, whiskey, and cookingnot in that order
Thank you for pinning this, MQ. I can't wait to refer newbies, or anyone who is struggling with craves, to this thread. 
If you are feeling stressed out or anxious or have difficulty sleeping (all common symptoms when you quit smoking), I highly recommend this 30-minute mindfulness meditation by Jon Kabat-Zinn. It's available for free on Youtube here:  Mindfulness with Jon Kabat-Zinn
to:   QTrainre:  first days nicotine Free In your First Few Days, while the Nicotine left your body, what helped you ? For me,  it was Sleep  (assisted with over the counter sleep medication or whisky).Ice Water.Satsumas, Citrus.Deep, deep breaths.Long 'singing' showers. (If I had known about y'all,  I guarantee I would have been here)  Edited to avoid controversy as to method of quitting smoking.I just want to know what helped you while nicotine left your body.  Newbies who have this fresh in your memory or anyone who hasn't posted, please post the things that helped you through your first days. Your experience will help others during the first days. Thank you,S
I get the fuzziest head when I quit smoking.  I can't think properly so I just learnt to go with the flow.  I had to be pretty accepting of myself particularly when I kicked a fence when a dog barked aggressively at me. For some reason I needed to drink a lot of water.   I was soooo thirsty.  Every day for the first week I've drunk at least 3.5 litres a day.  Sometimes I needed a lot of exercise.  I did a lot of walking and some weights but other days I was really fatigued and had a sleep.  I just had to get used to a new normal for a while until my body gets back to normal without nicotine.
For me it was:   Drinking lots of water Cinnamon hard candies No Coffee No Beer Running P90  and the most important thing.. NOT ROMANCING THE CIGARETTE.
Planned a special treat to look forward to.Used the Free NHS Quit Kit and found calendar really helped.Bought an E-Cigarette for emergency.Stuck notes everywhere to remind me why I was quitting.Slept.Fruit gums.If I had known about this forum helped I would have joined sooner!

I feel like the first few days is sort of a tug of war between "Yay I quit" and feeling strong and prepared with some moments of junkie thinking and self doubt. ALL temporary seeing as once you climb the hill you question how you could even think like that to begin with. My experience was very uplifting and powerful (coming from a ex relapser). As uplifting as it was it was still a struggle at times, the things that helped me with my first few days were;staying close to the board, read, re-read material until you can't read any more (everyone here knows what you are going through and that support really made a world of a difference)Allen Carr Material - relate it to yourself as much as you can (find examples of what you used to do) Drink lots of water (3L + a day) Journalling - made a one week journal and wrote everything from smoking problems to work issues.A questioning obsession with gum (it is slowly disappearing)I vowed to pledge NOPE for 365 days - and then some, but made a commitment to myself - this made me feel apart of something bigger than my smokingI ignored other people (more so close friends) who claim to quit but never follow through - their problem not mine (smokers like to feed off one another)Lots of exercise (which I did before but have more energy now) remembered to only tackle one day at a time :) Yikes, feel like I rambled :). Hope this helps!  Blessed be
For me I was just ready - I am at a good point in my life -I decided to focus on my future and my kids. I told my closest friends so I would be held accountable, I did not tell my family or children because I didn't want that kind of pressure. I came to the QT curious and ready - I was still smoking and had planned a quit date but after being on the site I was more addicted to the quit then actually smoking. I downloaded the ticker app on my phone and looked at it religiously when I couldn't hop on the site - It was a quest or a fun game for me to see how many days I could go and how many cigarettes I didn't smoke- I challenged myself but also avoided drinking unless it was a few drinks at night at my house (I do not drink and drive so I knew if I had a few drinks I would not even consider going to the store just to buy cigarettes) that helped because I got used to having a drink or two or more ;)  without smoking - then it just became normal for me. I don't really ever sleep much but instead of waking up at 2:30 and having a cigarette - if I woke up and couldn't sleep I would do some push ups and some pull ups and then back to bed. Change all routines that lead to smoking it is vital. This site and the people here gave me the strength and conviction to stay quit. Can't express gratitude enough.

Crochet, Hot Tea, Coloring, Lollipops and Gum, Long hot showers,Video Games, Naps and snuggling my baby. ETA: I misunderstood this post, this is how I got through my first days not smoking but I am using NRT.
I quit cold turkey so i knew that the first few days will be tough, and if i can get past that then i can truly give it up completely. The first day will be bad and you will often feel the urge to light up but you also become more aware of your triggers. On the second day you first feel proud that you could actually go without a smoke for one entire day and for me that was huge motivation to carry on for another day. On the third day, you are even more proud of your accomplishments, there are still strong urges to smoke at times, but it is less frequent now. On the fourth day i saw a drastic reduction in my desire to smoke and the urges were reduced substantially as well. I remember on this day i had to drive for a good hour for a long meeting with a client, and normally after such a meeting i would have been running back to my car to grab a smoke, but this time i did not feel like i needed it and this was an awesome feeling.  Remember that when you were smoking you were essentially taking a break from an activity, and i felt that it was important to still takes those breaks when you get the urges, but now fill those breaks with other tasks. I started browsing the news, taking a walk, eating a few snacks, and yes drinking lots of water.
Quitting is scary. The scary bit is BEFORE the quit. Fearing failure, or worse fearing success...the fear of NEVER having another cigarette. SCARY! So when I quit, I always focused on being Happy. I had done it. I quit. That's good news! Then sipping water. Keeping busy.
Drinking senseo cups of decaf and tea with sugar. In my 6th day I'm close to leave sugar behind!Keeping busy, laundry faulding, washing clothes, visiting my smoking neighbor (YES!) to face my smonster and it was a huge conquer; but this might not be suitable for everyone!
I Looked at Smoking Cessation sites to see what I was in for. Tried to cut down on smoking for a month before....unfortunately if I had cigarettes in the house I smoked them. Made a quick Quit Date: once this pack was gone I would not smoke again (and so far I haven't). Told family & friends I had quit smoking so it would be harder to go back without feeling like a failure. Made the choice to use Nicoderm gum....I had failed too many times in past trying  going cold turkey....I'm a 40 yr Smoker. Knowing I have mild COPD & only cure is stopping smoking. Losing my 6 yrs younger brother to a horrible death with lung cancer. Looking at my grandbabies & knowing they would be devastated to lose me. I take one day at a timeOnly use gum if I have to...but use it if I need to....beats a cigaretteSleep when I can...insomnia will go away soonPost on this site  & read everything I can...watch videos on the site....keep close to the boardwas up in morning & say "I am a non smoker" & feel proudDrink lots of waterChew "regular" gum....I am so afraid of  gaining weight...this curbs my appetite.

Done some workouts,watching some movies and went off to a friend home on that first day.. then i last long for a 2weeks of quit. The next week i get uses some cigar's but not that much i used before. And again i doing the same think (workouts,movies) to divert myself from cigars Note: i not a complete quiter yet. i just trying to bring the things under control.. then make it quit i hope ^_^ ^_^ ^_^

This is my plan (Hope it works): Now i trying to quit, So why not to bring that down step by stepFirst Step: try and do 1 week off...may use 1 per day...Second Step: 2 weeks off..may use 1 for a couple of days.....and so on i dont know ..its going to work or not but let a try is not a bad idea Hi Josephheg, and welcome to the Quit Train. First, congratulations on your decision to try to quit smoking! Helping you succeed is why we're all here, and so I hope you don't mind if I add my own thoughts about your plan to cut down smoking a little bit at a time. Many people on this board have different ideas about the best way to quit smoking, but I'm fairly sure that most of them will agree with what I'm about to say. Quitting by cutting down SOUNDS like a good plan, but it probably isn't. I bet almost all of us have tried to "get it under control" a number of times, and failed. The reason is because we're addicted to nicotine, and by cutting back a little bit at a time we're just prolonging our suffering and reinforcing how hard it is for us to stop. We might seem to succeed for a little while, but eventually we'll run out of willpower and go right back to where we where before. And then we have to start all over again, and we feel more powerless than ever. If we just QUIT, then we have to endure withdrawing from nicotine for a few days or weeks - mostly the first week is the worst part - and then it quickly gets easier and easier, until after a while we start to forget what it was even like to smoke. Please take 7 minutes to watch this youtube video from a quit smoking expert - he's talking about exactly this issue, and he explains it very well:
Reminds me of pulling a plaster of a sore....It might hurt so I'll do it very slowly... Ow,ow.ow....Much better to do it in one swift pull...it done over with...
Stay busy.... don't dwell. I love this, ChRiSpY, because that is exactly the trick for the first days and super advice for life in general. Stay Busy.....Don't Dwell. It helped me todayfor something not nicotine related,just another life lesson learned and used.

Sleep. Until the 5 month mark i slept 12 hours a day. I was very gloomy so at 9pm i thought screw it and just went to bed. I still dont enjoy life as much to this very day but at least im not sleeping so much now.
Sleep. Until the 5 month mark i slept 12 hours a day. I was very gloomy so at 9pm i thought screw it and just went to bed. I still dont enjoy life as much to this very day but at least im not sleeping so much now. How can a person sleep 12 hours a day when we have career's? It's not like I can take 5 month's off work simply because I stopped smoking. I hope you will begin to enjoy life. Cigarettes are not what will bring you joy. We both know that. It is finding that 'something' that FEELS like joy, I guess  like smoking did to you?..... All I can say to the new people who want to become a non-smoker is: first off, you want to WANT IT, and badly. Not just because of health reasons, family, friends etc. YOU are the one who has to want it, and then YOU are the one who will go through whatever your body will do when you stop feeding {smoking} the poison. It is not a fun little stroll in the park..not at all. But every hour, every day you can say 'wow, I didn't smoke for {x} amount of time'...will hopefully make you want to keep setting another short goal. Maybe another hour, 1/2 a day and so on.It still sucks. For me anyway, it sucked bad. In spite of all the health risk blah blah blah, there were times I did enjoy a cigarette with my coffee. A cigarette with my friend's on wine night. Or a cigarette when I was pissed off at the world. Now.........I drink tea, don't go out on wine night, but still get pissed at the world and find something else to do rather than focus on not smoking. It is NOT easy.
I have an excessively large bag of jolly ranchers.  I pop one in when I get a craving, when I'm bored or when I'm in the carI bought some aromatherapy candles and lotions.  Nothing calms me faster than a good smelling lotion, which actually smells good because you can smell it!!! Sniff the cravings away.Lots of water - I like carbonated water as it feels like I'm having a pop...makes it feel like a treatSupport from Quit Train (what a godsend)If I get a particularly bad craving on the weekend, I might take a quick napREADING (been my new habit)Going to a movieTaking my husbands never-smoked-in truck vs my smoked-in-everyday car
Taking in some real good deep breaths..get some nice clean air into your cleaning lungs.xxGoing for a walk..great when you get a crave..healthy too..
This is my 12 quit day   Had 3 cigarettes yesterday after 10 strong days of NOPE. Now I gotta start all over. Sooo hard cause I get really gloomy &I cry like a blubber a lot plus get pissed at my boyfriend who I also made my ex. Yesterday.  Well HERE I GO AGAIN.   So hard. Glad you are all here for us.
Hi joy..welcome...You need to read all you can  alot easier when you have the right tools..There is heaps of information here.to get you on your wayway..This is your day one ,if you smoked yesterday...smoking won't solve anything... Just make matters worse..Stay close..
Hey Joybella :) I'm glad you came back to us. Please also go to the dedicated daily NOPE pledge page here and pledge your NPE every day. It will help you focus on what you need to do each day. You are right, this isn't easy at all and the emotional part is particularly hard to deal with but if you want it badly enough, you will find a way to deal with the emotions without lighting up again. Your emotional state will get better with time, probably not as fast as you would like but it does get better. Have you spoken to your doctor about your quitting plan and what options there are to help you cope with the emotional aspect? That might e worth a try. Anything you can do to get you firmly established in your quit will be a very good thing. I look forward to following your journey. We'll be here to support you in any way we can :D
So glad you responded Doreen. Start tomorrow fresh by saying nope again. I'll be brave & do cold turkey   So fearful of withdrawals thou. Maybe it will be best if I buy a pack & leave unopened that way I can stare it down. My best friend smokes so when I go over I'll bring my pack. I'm really testing my resolve. But at least I won't be inclined to bum one. 
Thanks for being here for me Doreen. I'm going to make tomorrow my new quit date. I'm going to use my patches again for a while thou couple days on 21mg then cut down to 15mg. for a couple weeks then 7mg for a couple weeks &I I should be strong enough & away from it long enough that I will succeed.
Reciprocaly thanks for your support too. I've decided to do the patches over a months time gradually lowering dose of patch &I then I'm sure I'll be on the road to success. 
What ever you think will work best for you then, try it. In the end though, understand that this will come down to you wanting to be smoke free more than being a smoker. I would strongly recommend that you do not buy a pack of cigs. This is not a good idea under any circumstances. If they are that available, the temptation to light up is likely to get the better of you in the early days of your quit. Also, tell your friend you are quitting smoking. Your friend should know about this and I would think they will be supportive to you. Let us know how you're doing. We are here to lend support as needed  :)  Please also read all the information you can about this addiction. Once you truly understand there is no benefit to smoking, you will be able to give it up much more easily.
Have real cravings this afternoon want to bum cig from neighbor.  Gotta breathe & read  all my supporters posts!
Have real cravings this afternoon want to bum cig from neighbor. Gotta breathe & read all my supporters posts! There is only one way to kill the cravings for good...stop smoking.  With every NOPE the addiction loses its power and eventually cravings become a thing of the past.  Don't feed the beast. Everything you're feeling now (withdrawal, obsessive thoughts, etc.) is temporary.  The freedom gained from soldiering on through the rough patches will last you a lifetime.
Yes Joybella - you have to just power through these early days. I know it gets tiring trying to fight the urges to smoke but you just have to not give in and resist those urges to smoke. Today's struggles will give you strength to face tomorrow and things do start to settle down after a bit. It's different for everyone in terms of time frame but things do get better. Just take it one day or even one hour at a time. It WILL get better - I promise!! Come on here and read everything you can about the addiction of smoking. I spent a few days doing almost nothing else. Do whatever you need to do not to smoke.You CAN do this! We stand behind you in this fight :)
Keep busy..do anything...do jigsaws... Colouring books..puzzles...Come here and read till your eyes bleed...That little nico monster ..he's going to try and mess with your head...your stronger than he is..Tell him to naff off...your a beautiful non smoker...Your doing great ..believe it....
Well.. I'm back   feeling bad I started smoking again
Just dust yourself down...throw all cigs and lighter away..jump back on the train..your seat is still here..Have you read Allen Carr the easy way...if not I strongly recommend it asap...Learn by this..what went wrong..??....be ready next time...that little nico monster will try and lure you back...We have a SOS...post there before you smoke...if you need us...Never stick anything in your mouth and set fire to it...do anything else you can think of...You know you don't want to be a smoker..because you found us...make that firm stand...Read all old post here..watch all the video,S...so much info here..to help...
Joybella you can do this lad, anyone can. Commit to NOPE daily and stay strong. I wish you the best. :)
 Now I'm smoking & wishing I had stuck with saying NOPE.  No need to wish, you just do it.  All that time spent smoking and hating it, thinking about quitting, feeling trapped by the addiction and the self-loathing that comes with that...that's more of a burden than quitting smoking is.  I'm a failure at this I think. Really disappointed in myself thou.  Just because you haven't done it yet doesn't mean you can't do it right now.  Learn about the addiction.  Commit to the quit.  Start enjoying the benefits of freedom from nicotine immediately.  It is a simple process that will benefit you in so many ways.
Yes Joybella, what these others have said is true and yes, we are all here to support you but I think you know that you alone are the final deciding factor in quitting successfully. All of us were once in the same position as you are in now. The only way through is to just put up with the crummy feelings that come along with the early quit. They won't kill you and they won't last forever. It gets better as time goes on.  As others have said. Read as much as you can about this addiction. Watch the videos available right here on this site. Know what you are fighting for and why. Realize you CAN do it and commit to the quit! You can do it - believe in yourself :D

Thank you thank you thank you I'm going to jump back on this train you are all my lifeline of support. 
Good decision Joybella. Think about what you learned from having just relapsed. Why you did and how bad you felt after you had that first cig. Be stronger than the urge next time. Educate yourself about the addiction because as you do, you will understand the lies we tell ourselves about smoking. Smoking solves nothing and only adds to your problems. Stay close here and post your daily pledge in the NOPE thread every day. It will help remind you each day what you need to do for yourself. Let us know how you're doing too :)
Bumped for you kiwi..lots of suggestions here...Every crave you win..your nearer to winning your war..Sometimes I shouted nope all day..
Garden! Grow something. Or at least pull some weeds. I'm not quite 24 hours in here and I am flipping out. So right now, I am on my way outside to play with my cacti. Cacti like to give kisses and yes love hurts---- but it does reward you with some truly awesome flowers in the desert. Great time of year right now so I'm going to go outside and groove on some plants and flowers rather than thinking about cigarettes. Plus it is kind of hard to think about cigarettes when you're looking for the tweezers and magnifying glass to get little needles out of your fingers. Let's see after an hour or two of yardwork I can do the dishes, the dog needs walked, the rugs need vacuumed, I can take a nap then I can do some real work for a few hours, then I can make dinner, then I can walk the dog again, then I can do 3 loads of laundry, then I can do some ironing and then I can....   Gee....what on Earth am I going to do tomorrow?  So what's everyone else doing the next few hours?
I'm working from home today as well as taking care of some house repair/maintenance stuff. Good idea to keep busy during your early quit. Keep yourself occupied and not only will that help distract you; you'll have the cleanest & most organized house in the State by the time your 1st week is over :PI know you're feeling completely miserable now, it's just part of the process. The intense misery won't last that long and once you are through it, you'll be well on your way to securing your quit :)Come here often and let us know how you're doing. Also be sure to keep focused on your reason for quitting. Keep that in the front of your mind as it will help you through this tough part. Reflect on how far you've come even if it's just a day or two. The early days are really hard work so you don't want to throw that all away or have to repeat it. I know these two things kept me moving forward in the early days.
Wow A ...that's a full days work...don't burn yourself out..Pace yourself..It's too cold here for garden work..so a few jobs in doors....Right now...sitting and enjoying a relaxing cup of coffee...something you have to look forward to soon enough..Wait till your taste buds wake up..it's like WOW !!!!
Hey guys, Hugs to you all and hope you are all hanging in there! Be strong. Since it has been a beautiful day outside---sun shining and a bit breezy and warm, I made myself go outside and take the dog for a walk. Not sure about others but I'm finding just taking the time to enjoy the outside for a few minutes every day helps. Just to be in the sunshine, or take in some flowers or gaze at the sky for a few moments has been helping me. It has been giving me a sense of calmness and just a moment of peace where I can take a deep breath and inhale and say, "O.K. You got this. Just pull yourself together and make it through the next few minutes. You can do it. "  If you haven't already then try spending some time outdoors. Go for a short walk.  Sit out back on your patio/stoop or whatever and enjoy a cup of coffee or soda. Stargaze tonight.    
Yup, that's the way to do it AG :) Distract yourself and deep breathing to calm those anxious moments we all feel early on in our quits. You're lucky you can get outside and enjoy nice weather. Was well into the minus temps and snowy when I quit so I just huddled up inside for awhile. I know one of the things I noticed and enjoyed first when I quit was how much easier and more comfortable my breathing was. You're going about this exactly right too. Just deal with the here and now at first. Don't look too far down the road. day by day, hour by hour at first. You'll very soon be much more comfortable with this whole quitting thing :) Enjoy your start gazing 2-night. Sunsets are nice too when we get them :)
I swim everyday and go out for walks in the park for 45 minutes.  I will stop somewhere nice for a coffee.  I'm 18 days in and still having the cravings, but then I have a very happy feeling - I feel proud of myself.  NOPE
I think you will be very pleased going forward CP1973 :) Yes, the craving will still be there but not always and not really even craves - more just thoughts of smoking with the occasional crave thrown in. I found that to be true with me anyway. We're all a little different in our experiences and timing but with us all, it just gets better the further you get into your quit. You're doing GREAT Claire!
Cannot have tobacco in the home. I just flushed the rest of it down the toilet :)Cannot be around smokers, not because the smell repluses me, but because I like it & I want one...I need all the help I can get!!

I just flushed the rest of it down the toilet :)Cannot be around smokers, not because the smell repluses me, but because I like it & I want one...I need all the help I can get!!Do what you need to so you are not tempted to smoke, especially during the early part of your quit. After your sniffer comes back to normal, you will be able to smell smoke a long way away. Also, you'll be amazed at how stinky people who smoke really are to non smokers. I think you will actually like that part. We call what you are feeling "romancing the cigarette". You remember all the really good one's you smoked. You know, first one in the morning, after a meal, after going without one in a movie or on a flight. Those ones. Not all the ones that you smoked just to feed the addiction. You know, all those ones every day about every 1/2 hour or so? Once you are addicted, you are only feeding that addiction. All those smokes do nothing to help you or fix anything in your life. It's just shortening your life.
I busted this morning & had only one cigarette. It made me feel sooo dizzy!! Confirmed just how powerful this stuff is that i am putting into body!I felt rotten for having one. I dont want this to happen again. I have not had one since...I don't want to...I want success this time.The weather is lousy today. Cold windy rainy and will be tomorrow too. So I've cozied myself up in my unit for a couple of days and pampering myself. Burning in my little vapouriser, pure lavender oil. Doing 'dry skin brushing' and drinking fresh ginger teas, lots of water...all helps to detox & get rid of nicotine. Also using my circulation booster. Lots of gum too. I can feel the pangs of withdrawal
Day 1 not smoking for me: My plan for the day - work, finish scrubbing some wallpaper off my walls, cleaning, nap if possible (probably not!), draw, and go for a walk. I love Allan Carr's book, but it seems like he does not want us to replace anything with smoking.. I will obviously have to do things... that is the part I guess I don't understand fully.
Sounds like a solid day 1 plan. If I'm interpreting AC correctly, I think he's just cautioning against replacing one addiction for another even if it's a much less harmful one, like (regular) gum or candy. I take it as him just encouraging you to get on with life and enjoy your freedom. Congrats on your quit- can't think of a better decision you could have made. KTQ!
I just wanted to say that I am really, really happy that I made the decision to quit smoking. This post would probably be better in the prerespond to your own SOS, but I'm posting it here instead. I have not been smoke free for long, but I am just excited that I made this commitment. It's one of the biggest - best - things I can do for myself. I'm also hoping I can get out some good cries the next few days too :)
Oh, I'm sure you'll be able to get those out Holly. The emotional roller coaster ride will be with you for a bit yet but the good part is that the further into your quit you get, the easier things will start to get. Keep that positive attitude because this is indeed the best thing you could possibly do for yourself. And, you will be very proud of this accomplishment too!!

Back to day 1. I needed to make that 100% commitment to myself, whereas before I don't think I really believed it. I have many things to keep me busy today, so I am happy about that. No more smoking for me, ever. ☺
You can do it Holly...all you need is commitment to...Never Take Another Puff...If you ever feel like that again...reach out..to someone...we can help you through it..Put it behind you and March forward...x

Holding my breath for as long as I could, then exhaling... Gives you a little rush, like smoking super fast..... And root beer barrels
Deep breathing..great stuff..get all that fresh air going in to your lungs .much better than gunk...Your doing good...
    I slept like a rock. I was tired for like a week straight when I first quit. I didn't have any tantrums etc but just constant tired. So I guess that helped.
    The opposite here...couldn't sleep at all...I was running on empty...thankfully it soon settled ...
    Reading, reading, drinking coffee, reading, sleeping, reading, drinking coffee, and deep breathing.

Read all you can in the pinned threads on the Quit Smoking Discussion Page and watch the Joel videos that cover a wide range of topics related to quitting. Education about how this addiction works and why it does nothing good for you is a key to quitting! By the way ..... welcome to our family of quitters

On our main board...pinned with green squares ...is find of great info to get you up and running... Yes ..please go to the introduction thread ,and get a proper welcome ,to this fabulous place..  We have a daily NOPE thread too..great way to start the day....
    Sleeping    Twizzlers   Crisps  Exercise    Binge TV    Talking Board games Phone ga.es Social media        ...and that's just the first day. Anything but smoking.
    Exercise! Sugar-free candy, naps, carrots, dining out with family, message board, looking at horrible smoking pictures. That last one is really helpful
    So far, what's helped me is going for a walk, each time I have a craving, my craving is mostly at work, since that's where I smoked.        So I just go for a walk, and listen to some podcasts while I'm at it.   Has helped so far.
    bump 
    I'm still on the first day but so far-       hard candy  chewing gum     grape juice     ice water       As well as lots of reading here on the Qtrain. Those of you who post here may not realize it but you are literally life savers.
    I walked past a favorite hoodie I'd hung on the back of a door this spring and instantly smelled cigarette smoke and it made my mouth water a bit.       So, The hoodie went into the wash along with my work uniform and favorite shirts for a second cleaning to make sure there is no lingering siren song of tobacco to lure me back in to big tobacco's legion of cash drones.      
WOO-HOO!!  I've made it through the first 24 hours!   It may seem odd but I was very concerned about making it through this first day more than the days to come. It wasn't fun by any stretch of the imagination but it wasn't as brutal as I had feared,       Checking in here and reading all the advice and personal experiences helped immensely... Along with a lot of gum, hard candies,grape juice and deep breathing when the cravings got vicious.         I'm kind of looking forward to going to sleep tonight because that's like an 8 hour vacation from the battle and it gets me that much further along from the pull of that last cancer stick.
    Well done  T....your first day done and dusted..stay close...support is si important ....
    Great job @TobacNO  
WOOT! I can hardly believe it, I've made it 5 full days without smoking!         Having hard candies like Lifesavers, Werther's and Tootsie pops on hand hand definitely help a LOT!  Staying busy has been a big thing for me too. I washed my truck today even though it was raining lightly at the time just to have something to occupy myself. It really did help and I didn't think about smoking much at all during the process. I'm sure people driving by thought I was a raving lunatic though.        Anyway, These things and the others I posted on day 1 have helped me get this far and 5 days ago I wasn't at all sure I would make it through the first 24 hours without caving into to my addiction.
    Awesome! Don't worry about what people think. If you haven't been addicted to nicotine you don't know what it's like.   By the way... do you have to copy and paste a new ticker each time?
    Yay TobacNo, five days is great!

I loved watching mine that first year, it was such an inspiration and feeling of accomplishment to watch all the time, money and cigs not smoked add up
    bump    lots of tips to help you manage your first days, nicotine free.
    Nearly finished first day! Coffee, nice meals and some light yoga
    Bumping this for newbies and lurkers.   This thread is full of things that helped us through the first days of a quit.  Quitting isn't impossible, far from it.  It is an important experience that frees you from nicotine addiction.      I bump this to let ya'll know that quitting is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself and the people and animals that love you.
This is thread was perfect for me today. I have 2 days !! It has been years since I have gone even a day without smoking - so I am celebrating. I had some very stressful news yesterday and believe me I thought "oh no.- not now " And then realized If I want this quit TRULY - no amount of stress is going to make me light up. Hard to accept that but necessary. And here I am dealing with it - SMOKE FREE and let's face it, I am not trying to get out of work to have a smoke or avoid it - I am taking it head on and smoke free. This is NOT EASY in anyway - but it is possible.
@HeatherDianne you are awesome!!! Well done!!
Two days is absolutely amazing!  I hadn't gone even one full day without smoking for almost 2 decades before I quit, so I know well how every hour and day smoke free feels like (and is) a major accomplishment early on.  And good for you for not using stress as a reason to cave.  You're an all-star, HeatherD!
    High five Heather....your doing great ..what your achieving is flippin amazin .....

A similar thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago and thankfully I came through it as you did.   You've earned this:
    Do as much physically demanding activity as your can.  It will remind you why you're doing this in the first place when you're short of breath.  Each day you will be able to do a little more.

I. Hate. Cigarettes. +1
I have no words...just outrage and tears...
 :rolleyes: Not amazed,how sad. All we can do is stay cig free & convince others to quit to. :rolleyes:  :rolleyes: 
Should be required viewing for all in first weeks of nonsmoking.
This really strips my paint grrr, I wish I could have a five minute board meeting with the big wigs and a shovel!
I watched these  films with tears....And very angry.....and scared....After smoking 52 years.......have I dodged the bullet.....I pray I have....Total denial.....
Kinda freaks me they got away with crossing this line (the industry) and that youngsters still start smoking.... once you're hooked it's f ucking tough to break the nicotine habbit (just watched epi 1)
Get angry Evelyn.....These guys want you to stay hooked...and make them rich....Keeping your quit....so important....Hugs xx
It pisses me off how they deceive everyone!
Saw epi 2 it's outragious!
Õk going to watch epi 3 tomorrow
Õk going to watch epi 3 tomorrowWay to go, Evelyn. But have a couple of Twix, too, because those videos are gnarly and can leave a bad taste in the mouth!  :wizard:
Might do that... CPK! Last afternoon I saw 2 i was shocked. Right now it's peeying cats n dogs and windy so not going out to the store lol and besides tonight I have a seminar about relations in church :D look forward to that and don't want to waist my concentration, need to devide it LOL

Have a great day, Evelyn. And remember to bless your quit and keep it safe from all harm. I'll do the same with mine. xox
Bloody *sswholes of tabacco industrie-companies!
I watched these three episodes this weekend. I thought they were really good. Enjoyed them all with the exception of the woman smoking through her neck in episode 3. That's turned my stomach - I wish I could un-see that!!
Edit.  Right now, I know it will only upset me. I looked at the first minute. I don't think I have seen them. I know I will ... If, I am getting it right, Big Tobacco is now targeting 3rd World countries, with gusto. May they all rot in their own filth. *Kudos, to the people standing up to them.
Thought the newbies would like to see these...It made me very angry...xx
Bumping this post...for anyone who hasn't seen it....grrrrrr
Newbies and lurkers...
This post still makes me mad..For the newbies..
For those who have not seen this...Talk about a eye opener... A wake up call for sure...
Shocking to watch and yet my generation kind of knew and still they continue to deny it. Crazy.
The freedom loving libertarian in me says that smoking is a personal choice; as would be the selling of same. That being said I believe that there is a special place in hell reserved for tobacco executives whose philosophy could best be summed up as... All men have the right to dig their own graves, and I have the right to sell them the shovels. There are much better ways to contribute to society then by selling addictive poison...such as being a lawyer, or politician, or marketing porn.
I dunno about the last one. Porn kinda markets itself.
Bring this forward again...it was my light bulb moment...It still makes me angry today...All they care about is your money.. Who they murder in the process doesn't matter..
Bump for Evelyn xx

I watched all of these last night and thought all 3 were really interesting.  I was glued for almost three hours.       I wanted to come away hating the tobacco industry but it didn't happen for me. I think there was so much other stuff I hated that my hatred for the tobacco industry got a bit diluted.         I hated the night riders and was appalled at what they did      I hated the Government for not putting cigarettes into a food or drug bracket so they didn't have strict monitoring, that they were happy to take 1 million a day from tobacco companies and that the president's health advisor binned Project XA which was a safer cigarette called Palladium     I hated that nobody listened to the surgeons who expressed their concern at smoking and cigarettes      I hated that Carter got rid of Kalifarno who based his campaign on the danger of cigarettes. Carter went on to say that people rely on tobacco companies to make a living       Yes the tobacco companies supply the killer cigarettes, but the Government's clearly get so much revenue from them they don't want smoking to stop any time soon.       I was shocked at the underhanded tactics some tobacco companies used but then I'm shocked about a lot of things that happened back then. It was a different era and people got away with things they would never get away with now.         Maybe my thoughts mean I don't fit in to the ideals here, or maybe even that my quit is doomed for failure. I didn't come away in a rage like others have and I don't blame the tobacco companies for me smoking.       I do think they should have these documentaries as part of the school curriculum. The woman who smoked through her neck would shock anyone.

I am really angry at big tobacco and they're attitudes and sneaky practices... but I most certainly don't blame them for my smoking.... I just hate that they are happy to make millions peddling death.... does that make sense??? Anyway... not why I meant to post.... wanted to say there is now ideal to fit into here... we often disagree with eat other but we are grown ups and can usually disagree and even debate without insulting or disrespecting others. It most certainly does not mean your quit is doomed to fail.... that is just ludicrous. My rage is because they know the damage their product does and they just don't care.... but absolutely do not blame them for me smoking, I did that not them. I love that you opinion is different and you post about it.
Thanks Jo Edited November 2, 2018 by LillyJust me!
    bump cos this needs to be higher....
    This was at the top of my tool box....the more I watched ..the angrier I got ....my light bulb moment .!!!

    Are you sitting on the fence ????....are you Lurking ...watch these videos...and then jump on the Train...
    Front page stuff 
    Watching the Tobacco Wars gave me the power to quit, (along with the patch).  I had to change my emotion towards cigarettes, and Tobacco Wars gave me the ability to hate smoking.  I still watch it frequently.  Best viewing on the internet!
    Watching these totally changed my whole outlook on smoking ...it was my light bulb moment ....  I got mad...that I had been fooled all my life ..and fell into the trap they were hoping I would ...    Every smoker should watch these Documentaries...
    Need this in front page ...for anyone who hasn't watched them ...it was a life changer for me ...
Watched all three parts, what an eye opener!!! I still find myself trying to adjust mentally as an ex-smoker. Definitely an addictive product. Documentary doesn't touch on NRT and e-cigarettes though...i suppose because it was released a long time ago (1999). Maybe it needs a sequel. This is one documentary that everyone should watch (smoker/non-smoker/ex-smoker/never-smoker doesn't matter)

Whilst I appreciate that being nicotine free is the goal I don't agree with you that NRT is up there with cigarettes and e-cigarettes.                                                                                             23 minutes ago, Lilly said:                             @Lilly I've had a similar discussion on the forums regarding NRT before. NRT doesn't solve the problem with Nicotine addiction. It just shifts the focus from one source to another. Using NRT may have other side effects as well. The problem is that Nicotine is the addictive drug, it just doesn't matter which source it comes from. Compared to NRT, probably the only benefit, as far as I know, is that harmful tar (in the case of regular cigarettes) and chemicals released as vapor from the liquid (used in e-cigarettes), are not being inhaled. From what I've learnt, Nicotine as a stand-alone drug comes with its own health hazards. NRT may help some and may not help others. It depends from person to person. I am glad that NRT has helped you stay away from the more harmful cigarettes and e-cigarettes. I do hope that one day you will be completely Nicotine free.       P.S. - I hope you weren't offended by my mention of NRT in my previous comment. If so, I am sorry.Edited April 18 by Ankush
To be honest I wasn't offended by your original post but I would be lying if I said I wasn't by your response above.        I was feeling pretty proud of myself but some views on here regarding NRT bring me down.        For the record I don't feel that I'm trading one addiction for another. I feel I'm walking across a bridge where I left cigarettes behind me, when I get to the end of the bridge I step onto nicotine free land.       I want to celebrate and brag about my quit but those types of comments just make me feel deflated. Edited April 18 by Lilly

I was just laying it out as it is, that Nicotine is an addictive drug no matter what the source is. If NRT has helped you stay off cigarettes (which are more harmful then regular cigarettes themselves), then that's a good thing. I did say that I hope you will be Nicotine free one fine day and you said you are on your way to a Nicotine-free land, so my thinking is that we are on the same page with the fact that we both hope that you will be Nicotine free one day and I wish you the best for the same.  I know staying off cigarettes takes a lot of effort and time and considerable strength as well and I wasn't undermining your effort and time spent in staying smoke free in any way. Its an achievement to stay off cigarettes and I am happy for you.Edited April 18 by Ankush

    Lots of people use quit aids, including NRT products to help them quit. There's no shame in that. What ever you need to do to stop smoking and works for you is fine. Providing you have a good idea of how long you should be using the quit aid then follow that plan. Purging your body of nicotine doesn't take long. It's the mental adjustment to no longer smoking that  that requires more time. 
    All roads lead to Rome ....just get yourself there ....nicotine free.....   NRT ...can be a great aid to some ...as long as it is used as it is intended....    Some folk take the quick route...some take the slower route ....getting to Rome is what we are  all aiming for ...  To enjoy our lives Nicotine Free...

Nicodemon's Lies?by John R. Polito  Nicotine Cessation Educatorhttps://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_NicodemonsLies.html     Why a question mark behind "Nicodemon's Lies"? Because there is no Nicodemon. Because there are zero monsters or demons within us. It's just another lie, our lie, as dependency ignorance tried to make sense of continued smoking.    As teenagers, what most of us thought would be a brief rebellious experiment was quickly transformed into a powerful lifelong chemical addiction as regular nicotine feedings soon became mandatory.  Research confirms that for many, it only took a couple of nicotine laden cigarettes before the shackles of slavery started to close.      What seemed innocent soon resulted in a brain wanting disorder. Without us realizing it, nicotine was activating, saturating, de-sensitizing and up-regulating dopamine pathway receptors, as our brain's priorities teaching circuitry was taken hostage. Two, five, eight nicotine fixes a day. When will enough be enough?  "I'll quit tomorrow" or "I love smoking" became our cry!  Welcome to the realities of true chemical dependency.  A world built upon lies.    Science calls our lies denial.  Denial is an unconscious defense mechanism - just below the surface - for resolving the emotional conflict and anxieties that naturally arise from living in a permanent state of self-destructive chemical bondage.  Three primary areas of denial relied upon by nicotine addicts are dependency denial, cost denial and recovery denial.  Truth is sacrificed for peace of mind, to remain hostage in an artificial world of "nicotine normal," or to justify relapse.   Most nicotine addicts we'll see today are fully insulated by a thick blanket of unconscious denial rationalizations, minimization's, fault projections, escapes, intellectualizations and delusions that hide the pain of captivity or create the illusion that the problem is somehow being solved.    The average addict musters the courage to say "no" to the wanting for that next fix about once every 2.5 years. It's then that roughly 1 in 20 will succeed in breaking free for an entire year.  These horrible recovery statistics eventually result in half of us dying by our own hand, with male smokers losing an average of 13 years of life expectancy, while females lose 14.  Our intentional self-destruction is undeniable evidence of the depths of denial. Denial insulates us from the extreme price paid with each and every puff - a little more of life itself.  It doesn't have to be.   Welcome to WhyQuit, we've been waiting on you!  Aside from this article, we've put together a vast array of quality recovery tools to aid you in becoming far smarter than your addiction is strong. They include mind-expanding motivational pages, the Net's largest collection of original quitting articles, quitting tip lists, two free quitting e-books ("Never Take Another Puff" and   "Freedom from Nicotine - The Journey Home"), more than 400 free video lessons, and highly focused group support at Turkeyville, our Facebook group.     According to the World Health Organization, the next three years will cost 15 million of our brother and sister addicts their lives. Once residing here on Easy Street with us, we hope you'll share what you've learned as failure to either self-discover or be taught the "Law of Addiction" is a horrible reason to die.    OUR LIE:  My cigarettes are my friend.THE TRUTH:  Friend or master?  What kind of "friend" would deprive us of oxygen, take away our ability to smell, burn our clothes, destroy our teeth, harden our arteries, elevate our blood pressure, daily feed us 4,000+ chemical compounds that include arsenic, ammonia, acetone, formaldehyde, butane, massive doses of carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, methane, stearic acid, vinyl chloride, mercury, and lead, together with 81 known cancer causing agents (one of which is created when nicotine breaks down - NNK), before finally killing you with cancer, a stroke, a heart attack or emphysema?  Imagine seeing your executioner as a friend.  Imagine residing inside a mind that is so sick it is willing to trade 13 years of life for one chemical.     OUR LIE:  I enjoy smoking.THE TRUTH:  This may be the most deeply ingrained rationalization of all as it has a solid basis in the following flawed denial logic.  "I don't do things that I don't like to do." "I smoke lots and lots of cigarettes." "Therefore, I must really enjoy smoking," instead of the correct conclusion, "therefore, I must really be chemically addicted to smoking nicotine."  Did you enjoy being the unaddicted "you" or have you forgotten what it was like to live comfortably inside a mind that does not crave for nicotine?  If you cannot remember what it was like being "you" then what basis do you have for honest comparison?  If you truly enjoyed being addicted to nicotine then why are you here reading these words?  Is it that you liked smoking or that you liked not having to experience what occurred when you didn't smoke - withdrawal?  Studies have long ranked nicotine as a more addictive substance than either heroin or cocaine.  In fact, cocaine's generally recognized addiction rate among regular users is 15% while nicotine's addiction rate of over 70% is at least five times as great.  Imagine convincing your mind that it " likes " being addicted to the drug that addiction scientists now rank as the most addictive substance on all of planet earth.  We are nicotine addicts .  A pack a day smoker smokes 7,300 cigarettes each and every year.  How many of your last 7,300 nicotine fixes did you really enjoy ?  How many of the next 7,300 will bring tremendous joy to your life?  Isn't it time to be honest?    OUR LIE:  My spouse, close friend or family member smokes.  I'm waiting for them to quit with me.THE TRUTH:  Procrastination recovery denial makes the next puff of toxins easier to suck down.  Nicotine tells this junkie that they cannot quit until their friend or loved one quits too as they're around their smoke, smells, cigarettes, breath and ashtrays, and quitting is thus impossible.  It's pure denial and often both friends or loved ones use the other as their excuse to remain enslaved.  How long will you continue to destroy your body while waiting for someone else to quit with you?  A lifetime?  If and when they do quit with you, what will you do if they relapse?  Will "love" cause you to do the same?  One of you needs to stand tall and lead the way.  It's okay to have hope for a loved one but you must quit for "you" or it's doomed from the very start.   Why make your freedom, health or life dependent upon another person's decision.  As for being around smokers, it's unavoidable.  Should we expect planet earth's 1.2 billion nicotine addicts to disappear once we commence recovery?  Won't we still see them and smell their smoke at restaurants, as they stand around outside stores or even hospitals, or as they puff away in the car beside us?  Will all the stores pull-down their cigarette displays or move them from arm's reach just because we're trying to reclaim our mind and life?  Why live the lie that "I smoke for love!"   OUR LIE:  It reduces my stress and helps calm me down.THE TRUTH:  This stress buster rationalization is false.  The body's pH balance is delicate.  Nicotine is an alkaloid and stress an acid producing event.  The more stressful the event, the quicker the body's remaining nicotine reserves are neutralized (in the same manner as pouring a baking soda solution on an acid covered car battery terminal).  The stressed smoker is thrown into early chemical withdrawal adding additional anxiety to the underlying original stressful event.  It's why the anxiety associated with a flat tire causes smokers to reach for a cigarette while the non-smoker reaches for a jack.  The anxieties build until the doubly stressed smoker cries out "I NEED A CIGARETTE!"  Within eight seconds of the first puff, the smoker's nicotine blood serum nicotine level rises and their withdrawal anxieties subside.  The addict is left with the false impression that smoking cured the underlying stressful event when in fact the tire is still flat.   All non-smokers experience stress too.  The difference is that they don't add early nicotine withdrawal to it.  In truth, stress nicotine depletion causes smokers to experience far more anxiety than non-smokers.  In truth, it is much easier and calmer being the real "you" than it is living as a chemical slave.   OUR LIE:  My friends smoke, I'll lose them.THE TRUTH:  The nicotine smoker's mind has been conditioned to believe, through association, that smoking is central to their entire life.  Telephone calls, computer time, work, meals, driving, talking, walking, stress, joy, sorrow, and even romance, may have developed a subconscious association with smoking.  The truth is that none of these activities will be altered whatsoever by the absence of tobacco.  The truth is that quitting smoking will not deprive you of even a single friend or loved one.  The truth is that smoking is costing you new friends and possible relationships as fewer and fewer non-smokers are willing to tolerate being around the smell and the smoke.  Can you blame them?  With the exception of quitting, your current life doesn't need to change at all unless you want it to change.  It might be nice to enlarge your circle of friends to include those who don't stand around the community ashtray, but that's totally up to you.   OUR LIE:  It wakes me up and keeps me alert.THE TRUTH:  This dependency rationalization uses a basic truth (nicotine releases adrenaline and a host of other hormones) to hide the fact that nicotine deprives us of the ability to enjoy prolonged periods of deep conscious relaxation.  If always at the peak of alertness because we are addicted to and chemically dependent upon a central nervous system stimulant then when do we truly relax?  This dependency rationalization also subverts and ignores a host of natural alertness techniques ranging from a simple deep breath to brief periods of stretching or moderately exhilarating activity.  Instead of engaging life on life's terms, a powerful puff of nicotine starts a neurochemical chain-reaction that increases breathing rate, accelerates heart rate, constricts blood vessels, elevates blood pressure, causes the liver to release stored cholesterol into the blood stream, the adrenal gland to release glucocorticoids, the thyroid to release metabolism hormones, the hypothalamus to release corticotropin-releasing hormones, a decrease of progesterone levels in females and testosterone in males, digestive tract shut-down, a glucose release into the bloodstream followed by a boost in insulin to metabolize it, pupil dilation, and your blood to thicken.  Inside those highly constricted and over-pressurized blood vessels, carbon monoxide eats away at their teflon like lining (endothelium) while nicotine amazingly vascularizes fat buildups, causing arteries to harden.  More smokers die from circulatory disease each year than from lung cancer, yet denial kept almost all of them from wanting to know how or why.  What goes up must come down.  Once the hormones wear off and that drained feeling begins to arrive, a new puff of nicotine again whips every central nervous system neuron in a tired body like some overworked horse never allowed to rest.  Alert, yes, but somewhere in that endless cycle between alert and exhausted resides the "real" you.   OUR LIE:  My concentration is better.THE TRUTH:  Vast quantities of carbon monoxide do NOT improve concentration.  Although nicotine is a stimulant and does excite certain brain neurons, it also constricts all blood vessels.  Feel how cold your fingers and toes get when deprived of blood flow while smoking.  Imagine what's happening to the blood vessels in your brain.  If nicotine results in a stroke we probably won't need to worry much about concentration.  Fresh air and exercise are far healthier brain stimulants.  When quitting it's important that you understand the role that nicotine played in regulating blood sugar as its absence may cause the temporary impairment of concentration and clear thinking.  If you are experiencing any concentration problems be sure and drink plenty of fruit juice the first three days if your diet and health permit (cranberry is excellent), as it will help stabilize blood sugars.  Also don't skip meals!  Nicotine released stored fats into our blood and in a sense fed us with every puff, but not anymore.  Don't eat more food each day, just spread your normal intake out more over your entire day so that you keep fuel in your stomach and your blood sugar level.    OUR LIE:  It's something to do with my hands.THE TRUTH:  So is playing with a loaded gun and they both have the same potential for harm.  This weak addiction rationalization ignores that doodling with a pen, playing with coins, squeezing a ball or using strength grippers may be habit forming but are non-addictive.  You might get ink on yourself, rich or strong wrists but your chances of serious injury or death are almost zero.  OUR LIE:  My coffee won't be the same.THE TRUTH:  More junkie thinking!  Your coffee's flavor will remain identical.  In fact, it may even taste better once your taste buds heal after years of being numbed, coated and poisoned.  Your sense of smell may become so refined that you'll smell fresh coffee brewing more than one hundred feet away.  Although you don't need to give up your coffee or any thing else except nicotine during recovery, be aware that nicotine somehow doubles the rate ( 203%) by which caffeine is metabolized by the body. As a new ex-smoker you may only need half as much caffeine in order to obtain the same effect.  If you are a heavy caffeine user and find yourself experiencing increased anxiety during recovery, or encounter difficulty sleeping, try reducing your intake by roughly half.  OUR LIE:  There's lots of time left to quit.THE TRUTH:  This year tobacco will kill 5,000,000 humans. Roughly 1 in 4 smokers die in middle-age, each an average of 22.5 years early.  In order for 22.5 to be the average, how many hundreds of thousands had to die even younger?  Maybe you have plenty of time remaining and maybe not.  Dying in your thirties or forties is a powerful price to pay for guessing wrong.  The numbers above only reflect DEATH by tobacco.  You may be lucky enough to be among the millions of nicotine smokers each year who survive and "only" have a heart attack, a stroke, a lung removed, go onto oxygen, or who receive news of permanent lung disease as they for every breath.  Which puff, from which cigarette, in which pack, will pull the trigger that fires the gun?  The odds of a male smoker dying from lung cancer are 22 times greater than for a non-smoker.  His odds of dying from emphysema are ten times greater.  How much longer will your luck hold?   OUR LIE:  It's one of my few pleasures in life.THE TRUTH:  Does that mean that it's better than the pleasure of having a throat to deliver fresh air and great food, two lungs with which to laugh, a healthy heart to feel love, or an undamaged mind which dreams of wonderful tomorrows?  Pleasure from your addiction or pleasure in committing slow suicide at the hands of a mind that thinks it can only live with the aid of a powerful stimulant?  What do they call someone who derives pleasure from self-inflicted harm or who slowly puts themselves to death?  Pick your own label. Which nicotine fix out of the last 5,000 was the one that brought you tremendous pleasure?  Which cigarette out of the next 5,000 may be the one that sparks permanent damage or disease, or that carries death's eternal flame? If bad news arrives tomorrow will "pleasure" cross your mind?  As for Newport type "pleasure," isn't the real pleasure in satisfying our brain's wanting for more? Now imagine the pleasure of going 72 hours without nicotine, the pride of once again residing inside a nicotine-free body and mind!   OUR LIE:  Dad just died, this isn't the time!THE TRUTH:  Smoking won't bring dad back nor cure any other ill in life.  Success in quitting during a period of high stress in life insures that future high stress situations will never again serve as the mind's excuse or justification for relapse.  If you think about it, if we continue to live we will all see someone we love die. Such is the cycle of life.  Sadly, serious illness, injury, or the death of a loved one are some of the most convincing relapse justifications, the best yet sickest excuses of all to get our drug back.  I mean, who would dare question our drug use upon our mother's death? There is no better time to quit than before your next mandatory feeding.  In fact, two recent studies found that unplanned quitting attempts are twice as likely to succeed as planned ones (picture quitting day anticipation anxieties slowly eating away and destroying resolve before quitting day ever arrives). Why allow finances, work, illness, education or relationships to serve as an excuse to remain an active addict?  Once free, there is no legitimate justification for ever putting nicotine back into our body - none, zero, never!    OUR LIE:  Lots of smokers live until ripe old age.THE TRUTH:  They are much rarer than you think.  Look around.  If you do find old nicotine smokers almost all are in poor health or in advanced stages of smoking related diseases, many with oxygen.  Laboring for every breath with lungs on their last leg, is that ripe enough for us?  Nicotine smokers tend to think only in terms of dying from lung cancer.  Tobacco kills in many ways.  For example, circulatory disease caused by smoking kills more smokers each year than lung cancer.  How long would George Burns have lived to be if he hadn't smoked cigars, 115, 125?  Click here to look at the " truth ".  What's wrong with dying healthy from natural causes!   OUR LIE:  I get bored.  It helps pass the time.THE TRUTH:  Tobacco does not control any clock on earth but it does control you .  For the pack a day nicotine smoker it takes about 30 minutes before their blood serum nicotine level drops to the point where their mind sends them an "urge" of discomfort to remind you that it's time for a feeding.  It doesn't matter where they are or what they're doing.  Depending upon your daily nicotine requirements, the voice inside your head will let you know when it's time.  All you're doing when bored is being alert to what lies ahead, so that you keep topping off your nicotine tank before the next urge arrives. Boredom is supposed to be a positive form of anxiety that motivates us to accomplish a task that hopefully helps preserve life, not destroy it.     OUR LIE:  It's my choice and I choose to smoke!THE TRUTH:  It's a lie and you know it!  We lost all "choice" and the ability to simply walk away the day that nicotine feedings became mandatory.  The only choices now are to either arrest our dependency or to decide how early and often we'll feed it. As harsh as this sounds, nicotine dependency is a brain wanting disorder, a true mental illness. But the ignorant nicotine addict still believes the "choice" myth pounded into their brain by an endless stream of highly effective tobacco company marketing. All the pretty colored boxes, the displays, the sea of store ads, they make it seem like we can't wait to wake-up each day and run down to the store and try a new brand. Although a well set trap for gullible children and teens who can't wait to become adults, it also makes quitting more challenging than need be. The uneducated smoker likely associates smoking with reading the newspaper, coffee, travel, stress, other smokers, telephone calls, meals, celebrations, romance, or even as a necessary step prior to walking into a store.  The educated nicotine addict sees all nicotine fixes as either mandatory, or an early feeding, in order to avoid the onset and discomfort of chemical withdrawal. We smoked after a meal because it was once again time for a nicotine feeding. We smoked before the meal because we didn't know how long eating would last and it isn't polite to eat and smoke at the same time.  If your regular feedings are spaced thirty minutes apart, at least every thirty minutes you're going to start sensing growing want for more nicotine regardless of the activity.    OUR LIE:  I'm only hurting me.THE TRUTH:  Have you stopped for even one moment to reflect upon the financial, physical or emotional pain that your needless dying and death will bring your loved ones?  Do we care that the deadly byproducts of our addiction have the potential to harm or kill family members, whose only crime was loving us?  According to the World Health Organization secondhand smoke contributes to causing lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis, colds, coughing, wheezing, worsening of asthma, middle ear disease, cardiovascular disease, and even neuro-behavioral impairment (especially in young children).  It also found that maternal smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke during pregnancy is a major cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), reduced birth weight and decreased lung function.  How much does it cost to attempt to cure mouth, throat or lung cancer?  $100,000?  $200,000?  $300,000?  What's the cost of a funeral today and which loved one have you designated to pay the emotional price of making arrangements for your early departure?  What about the loss to loved ones of our guidance, our help around the house or any income we contribute? Where will they turn?    OUR LIE:  A cure for cancer is coming soon.THE TRUTH:  Between Europe and North America tobacco will kill over one million this year.  How many of them thought that a cure was on the way?  Sadly, it was false hope.  As hopeless drug addicts they waited, and waited and waited. What type of lung cancer are hoping they'll cure - squamous cell, oat cell, adenocarcinoma, or one of the less common forms of lung cancer? Even if a cure is coming for all forms and types of cancer caused by tobacco (and there are many), what will be left of your lungs by the time it arrives?  If you're gambling on "how" tobacco will kill you, don't forget to consider heart attacks, strokes, and emphysema.  Which cure are you betting on?     OUR LIE:  I smoke lights and they're not as bad.THE TRUTH:  Lights, ultra-lights and milds are often capable of delivering the same amount of tar and nicotine as regular brands, depending on how they're smoked.  It's why use of those terms are being banned by governments. They do not reduce most health risks including the risk of heart disease or the risk of cancer.  In fact, their smokers often take longer drags which means more tar and more nicotine than advertised.  Others simply smoke a greater number of lights because they feel short changed.   OUR LIE:  It's my right to blow smoke!THE TRUTH:  And it's the right of non-smokers and ex-smokers to be free from your smoke too. Social controls to protect the rights of non-smokers are now sweeping the globe.  Can a dog's life-span be cut in half by a smoking master?  Would you intentionally double the risk of heart attack or triple the risk of lung cancer for a spouse or family member?  Why kill the innocent too?  Are non-smokers who get extremely upset at having to breathe side-stream smoke simply being obnoxious or are they fighting to protect themselves and those they love from the known harms generated from burning a plant that contains 44 known cancer causing agents and releases 4,000+ chemical compounds when burned?  Do you know a child whose mother smoked while pregnant, who does not suffer from some form of impairment today?  Look closely.     OUR LIE:  Quitting causes weight gain and it's just as dangerous.THE TRUTH:  This intellectual denial pre-assumes a large weight gain and then makes an erroneous judgment regarding relative risks.  Quitting does not increase our weight, eating does.  Some assert that metabolic changes associated primarily with the heart not having to work as hard could account for a pound or two but as far as being " dangerous," you'd have to gain at least 75 additional pounds in order to equal the health risks associated with smoking one pack a day.  Keep in mind that your general health, physical abilities and lung capacity will all improve dramatically.  If patient, you will soon regain the ability to build cardiovascular endurance, and experience up to a 30% increase in overall lung function within 90 days. You'll be able to apply the same mental recovery tools needed to take control of your addiction in shedding any extra pounds, just one pound at a time.  Remember, smoking was your cue that a meal had ended.  Unless you develop a new healthy cue there may be fewer leftovers.  Also keep in mind how easy it would be for a drug addict to use intentional weight gain to a ploy to sabotage recovery. Additionally, nicotine stimulated brain dopamine pathways and so does food. Be careful not to use food as a destructive dopamine replacement crutch. If at all concerned, consider having a supply of fresh fruits and veggies cut up, handy and ready to eat during the 2-3 weeks it takes the brain to restore natural dopamine pathway sensitivities.  OUR LIE:  It's too late now to heal these lungs.THE TRUTH:  Nonsense!  While true that each and every puff destroyed more of each lung's roughly 300 million air sacs (alveoli), we were each blessed with millions more than needed to live a full and complete life. It's amazing how much damaged lungs can repair themselves unless disease or cancer has already arrived. Even with emphysema, although destroyed air sacks will never again function, quitting now will immediately halt the needless destruction of additional sacs.  You only have two options - decay or heal, including the possibility of experiencing up to a 30 percent increase in overall lung function within 90 days of quitting.  If continuing assault by the 81 cancer causing chemicals so far identified in cigarette smoke, which cigarette in which pack contains the spark that gives birth to that first cancerous cell?  OUR LIE:  I'd quit but withdrawal never ends!THE TRUTH:  Hogwash! If you remain 100% nicotine free for just 72 hours your blood will become nicotine free, your withdrawal anxieties will peak in intensity and the number of psychological craves will peak in number.  The greatest challenge will be over.  Actual physical withdrawal will be complete within 2-3 weeks as the brain re-sensitizes dopamine pathway receptors and down-regulates their numbers to levels seen in non-smokers. During that time you'll encounter and recondition (extinguish) all but remote or seasonal psychological habit crave triggers and begin to witness the gradually diminishing influence of thousands of nicotine replenishment memories, memories that belonged to an actively feeding addict who once again was in need of a fix. If you focus on taking recovery just one hour, challenge and day at a time, before you know it you'll experience your first day of total comfort, where never once do you think about wanting to smoke nicotine.  I call it a silent celebration because you probably won't even realize that it has happened until the next day.  After the first such day, they grow more and more frequent until they become your new sense of normal.  If just starting out, the rich and deep sense of comfort and calm that awaits you is beyond your enslaved mind's ability to comprehension.  Why? Because your dopamine pathways, your mind's priorities teacher, have been hijacked, making that next nicotine fix as important as eating food. Food craves, nicotine craves but with one critical difference. Without food we die. Without nicotine we thrive. It's why, although as real as your name, you cannot trust the nicotine wanting message that pounds inside your head, as it is false and is destroying you.    OUR LIE:  But the craves last for hours!THE TRUTH:  Just like the lingering thought of a nice juicy steak, lobster in butter sauce, or fresh baked hot apple pie, you can make yourself "think" about having a cigarette all day long, if that's what you really want to do.  Unlike fixating on a conscious thought about smoking, subconsciously cue triggered crave anxiety attacks almost always last for less than 3 minutes. But it's important that you look at a clock and time the crave episode as cessation time distortion (a normal and expected recovery symptom) can make minutes feel like hours.  The good news is that most of the anxiety surrounding crave episodes is self induced and thus controllable.  Key is in not trying to hide or run from your mind's junkie thinking but exposing it to honest analysis and positive thinking.  Strip away all the self-inflicted anxiety and at worst, what remains on quitting day 3 for the "average" quitter is just 18 minutes of true crave anxiety (an average of six craves, each less than three minutes in duration).     OUR LIE:  I'll quit after the next pack, next carton, next month, my next birthday or New Years.THE TRUTH:  Oh really? Can you count on both hands and all your toes how many times you've lied to yourself with such nonsense? And which pack, carton, month or birthday will give you the best chance for success?  Forget buying nicotine laden cigarettes by the pack or carton.  A case is even cheaper!  With the way that cigarette prices are shooting through the roof, you might as well calculate how many it will take to keep you in nicotine for life and buy them all now.  The only problem with that is in determining how long you have left to live.  How many more pack, carton, birthday and New Year's lies will you tell to yourself?  When will they stop?  If you continue on your present path, many Birthdays will likely be canceled by a rather early Deathday.  You are a true drug addict in every sense and the "wanting" inside your brain is as real as the greatest truth you know. What isn't true is the message, that that next fix is important. Truth is, everything now done under nicotine's influence can be done as well as or better without it.   OUR LIE:  I like to smoke when I drink and I find myself smoking even more.THE TRUTH:  The effects of drinking and stress upon our body's nicotine level are nearly the same.  You smoke more when you drink not because you "like" to but because you MUST. Like stress, alcohol is an acid producing event that causes urine to become more acidic.  The greater the acid level of urine, the quicker our kidneys remove and eliminate nicotine reserves from the bloodstream. Thus, the more you drink, the more nicotine you'll need to smoke or ingest in order to avoid sensing the onset of the anxiety of early withdrawal.  Although early alcohol use contributes to destroying a great many quit attempts, understanding the nicotine-acid relationship can be of benefit in accelerating physical nicotine withdrawal so that quitters can begin feeling relief sooner.  Acidic fruit juices, such as cranberry, may help reduce the normal 72 hours of withdrawal required to remove all nicotine from the blood.  In that roughly 50% of all relapses are associated with alcohol use, if at all possible don't drink during the first few days of recovery.  When you do decide to drink, consider drinking at home first without cigarettes around before testing your resolve around smokers.  By doing so you'll help to break the your mind's psychological links between smoking and drinking with as little risk as possible.  As millions of ex-smokers can attest, your beer or drink will taste better than ever once your taste buds are allowed an opportunity to heal.   OUR LIE:  It's too painful to quit!THE TRUTH:  Compared to what?  Three days of physical withdrawal (just 72 hours) in no way compares to the pain of months of chemotherapy, lung removal surgery and a two foot scar, a losing battle with throat cancer, years of trying to recover from a serious stroke or massive heart attack, or fighting for every breath through emphysema riddled lungs as you drag oxygen around for the balance of life.  If you're really worried about hurt then why continue your daily destruction?    OUR LIE:  If I quit, I'll just start back again.  I always do.THE TRUTH:  The truth is that you do not have to relapse.  We relapse because we rewrite the Law of Addiction, we forget why we quit, or we invent lies and stupid excuses, such as those that fill this page.  Your next quit can be your last but you need to learn how to care for your recovery, while always applying the only rule that you'll ever need to obey - to NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!  OUR LIE:  I'll cut down or quit and smoke just one now and then.THE TRUTH:  It's every addict's dream, to control the uncontrollable. You are addicted to a substance that is five times as addictive as powdered cocaine (15% vs. 75%).  You may be strong enough to cut back but so long as nicotine continues to arrive you'll remain hooked, the decay will continue, and as studies suggest, even though smoking less your health risks will remain almost unchanged. If you were a pack-a-day nicotine smoker and after quitting you decide to smoke just one cigarette, you might as well get ready to smoke the other 7,300 for the year too as full and complete relapse is virtually assured. The Law of Addiction is simple - just one puff of new nicotine and it's over. Brain scans show that up to 50% of dopamine pathway receptors become occupied by nicotine within eight seconds of the first puff. While roughly half walk away from relapse totally convinced that they've gotten away with smoking just once, they've saturated and de-sensitized dopamine pathway receptors and will soon find their brain begging for more.  You see, as permanent as alcoholism, once hooked we somehow stay hard wired for relapse for the balance of life. Although recovery allows the brain time to heal and function normally again the tracks of addiction remain. We cannot cure or kill our disease. Once free, we remain on probation for the balance of life.   OUR LIE:  I tried quitting but my family stopped supporting me or was giving me such a hard time that it caused me to throw in the towel.THE TRUTH:  It's a lie.  You gave up because you used your family as a cheap excuse to get your drug back.  You exaggerated everything they did or didn't do.  You were looking for any excuse.  You're the drug addict yet you expected them to understand the weakness and thinking of a drug addict's mind.  Maybe they didn't pat you on the back as often as you wanted, but is it really fair to expect them to appreciate the magnitude or duration of your challenge if they've never been through chemical withdrawal themselves?  They just want you to be normal.  They don't know how to react.  Do they pat you on the back and keep reminding you, or hope and pray that the worst has already passed?  Feeling unappreciated, picking fights and creating confrontation are tools of the addict's mind that are often used as weapons in order to reclaim their drug.  Some know that if they inflict tremendous stress on loved ones that they may even convince their loved one to beg them to start smoking nicotine again, or better yet, to go buy their relapse cigarettes for them.  That way, they can blame their relapse on their loved one. "They just couldn't handle my quitting." "Maybe next time!"  The lengths to which we'll go in order to feed our wanting are almost beyond belief.  Yes, some of us will even hurt those that love us most.   OUR LIE:  OK, I'm going to stop!  Now I can enjoy my smokes until then!THE TRUTH:  If you've done this more than once, isn't it just more junkie head games?  This addict wants to feel good about smoking nicotine and they've learned that by saying that they're going to quit, that they make themselves feel better even though deep down they know that it's probably just another lie!  Unless something awakens this addict, there may never be a serious quit in their future.     OUR LIE:  I've got to die of something!THE TRUTH:  True, but if you knew that tomorrow morning at 9:22 a.m. a massive smoking induced stroke would bring your life to an abrupt end, and you'd die on a cold floor with a cigarette beside you - just as tens of thousands of smokers are found each year? Would you light that last cigarette at 9:21 a.m. and pull the trigger that kills you?  Is this one of your primary use rationalizations?  Look around at all the smokers you see today.  The death certificates of half will read, "cause of death - smoking."  Yes, they had to die of something but not an average of more than 5,000 days early.  Have you met Noni, Bryan, Deb and Kim?  Would any non-addicted human spend each and every day of the remainder of their life intentionally destroying more of their body's ability to receive and transport life giving oxygen? Would they continue doing so until physical exercise was no longer an option, or until this mental illness called dependency forced others to begin caring for us, as they watch us struggle just to suck oxygen from tanks and machines?  Which family member have you prepared to be your care giver?  Try to imagine what it's like to breathe through a straw?  It's called emphysema.  Why not find a straw and give it a try. What has nicotine done for you lately?  OUR LIE:  I can't quit alone. I'll need nicotine gum, the patch, hypnosis, e-cigs, acupuncture, magic herbs or other wonder drugs!THE TRUTH:  Wrong!   The simple truth is that no magic cure has ever "made" any smoker quit smoking nicotine.  The key to immediate and lasting abstinence is education and understanding, in becoming vastly more dependency recovery savvy than our addiction is strong. Hypnosis and acupuncture teach us nothing, nor does use of nicotine replacement products that fail roughly 93% of users within 6 months of quitting, while making NRT slaves of a substantial percentage of those who actually quit smokings. What quitting product and procedure salesmen will never tell you is that each year cold turkey generates more successful long-term ex-users than all other quitting methods combined. Why? Because they want your money. Remember, should all else fail, you always have you!    OUR LIE:  It's all Nicodemon's fault, not mine!THE TRUTH:  There is no Nicodemon, no little monsters, no big monsters, no monsters at all.  None!  In fact, the title to this article, Nicodemon's Lies, is one of the biggest lies of all.  They were never Nicodemon's lies but our lies.  Nicotine is simply a chemical, a drug, an alkaloid known as C10H14N2. Its I.Q. is and always has been zero.  It does not think, plan, inflict punishment, nor will it conspire to make you relapse or die addicted to it.  The fact that it has zero intelligence has always been your greatest weapon.  Everything you see, feel, and sense during nicotine withdrawal and recovery will be grounded in chemical dependency, conditioning, reason, logic, emotion or science.  Any conspirators in any past attempts to make you relapse and destroy your recovery were always and only "you!"  Never once did you relapse due to external circumstances. It was 100% internal, once again you introduced nicotine into your bloodstream. The good news is that while each defeat was yours, so too will be the victory. Should you end nicotine's control of your brain's reward pathways the victory will belong only to you!
Quit Smoking Recovery TimetableWithin ...20 minutesYour blood pressure, pulse rate and the temperature of your hands and feet have returned to normal.   8 hoursRemaining nicotine in your bloodstream has fallen to 6.25% of normal peak daily levels, a 93.75% reduction.  12 hoursYour blood oxygen level has increased to normal. Carbon monoxide levels have dropped to normal.     24 hoursAnxieties have peaked in intensity and within two weeks should return to near pre-cessation levels.     48 hoursDamaged nerve endings have started to regrow and your sense of smell and taste are beginning to return to normal. Cessation anger and irritability will have peaked.    72 hoursYour entire body will test 100% nicotine-free. Over 90% of all nicotine metabolites (the chemicals nicotine breaks down into) have passed from your body via your urine.  Symptoms of chemical withdrawal have peaked in intensity, including restlessness. Unless use cues have been avoided, the number of cue induced crave episodes experienced during any quitting day have peaked for the "average" ex-user. Lung bronchial tubes leading to air sacs (alveoli) are beginning to relax in recovering smokers. Breathing is becoming easier and your lung's functional abilities are improving.    5 - 8 daysThe "average" ex-smoker is down to experiencing just three cue induced crave episodes per day. Although we may not be "average" and although minutes may feel like hours when normal cessation time distortion combines with the body's panic response, it is unlikely that any single episode will last longer than 3 minutes. Keep a clock handy and time the episode to maintain an honest perspective on time.    10 daysThe "average" ex-user is down to encountering less than two crave episodes per day.  10 days to 2 weeksRecovery has likely progressed to the point where your addiction is no longer doing the talking. Blood circulation in your gums and teeth are now similar to that of a non-user.  2 to 4 weeksCessation related anger, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, impatience, insomnia, restlessness and depression have ended. If still experiencing any of these symptoms get seen and evaluated by your physician.     2 weeks to 3 monthsYour heart attack risk has started to drop. Your lung function has noticeably improved. If your health permits, sample your circulation and lung improvement by walking briskly, climbing stairs or running further or faster than normal.   21 daysThe number of acetylcholine receptors, which were up-regulated in response to nicotine's presence in the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, basal ganglia, thalamus, brain stem and cerebellum regions of your brain have now substantially down-regulated. Receptor binding has returned to levels seen in the brains of non-smokers (2007 study).     3 weeks to 3 monthsYour circulation has substantially improved. Walking has become easier. Your chronic cough, if any, has likely disappeared. If not, get seen by a doctor, and sooner if at all concerned, as a chronic cough can be a sign of lung cancer.   4 weeksPlasma suPAR is a stable inflammatory biomarker that helps predict development of diseases ranging from diabetes to cancer in smokers. A 2016 study found that within 4 weeks of quitting smoking, with or without NRT, that suPAR levels in 48 former smokers had fallen from a baseline smoking median of 3.2 ng/ml to levels "no longer significantly different from the never smokers' values" (1.9 ng/ml)   8 weeksInsulin resistance in smokers has normalized despite average weight gain of 2.7 kg (2010 SGR, page 384).     1 to 9 monthsAny smoking related sinus congestion, fatigue or shortness of breath has decreased. Cilia have regrown in your trachea (windpipe) thereby increasing the ability to sweep dirt and mucus out of your lungs. Your body's overall energy has increased.  1 yearYour excess risk of coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke has dropped to less than half that of a smoker.   5 yearsYour risk of a subarachnoid hemorrhage has declined to 59% of your risk while still smoking (2012 study). If a female ex-smoker, your risk of developing diabetes is now that of a non-smoker (2001 study).  5 to 15 yearsYour risk of stroke has declined to that of a non-smoker.  10 yearsYour risk of being diagnosed with lung cancer is between 30% to 50% of that for a continuing smoker (2005 study). Risk of death from lung cancer has declined by almost half if you were an average smoker (one pack per day).  Risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus and pancreas have declined. Risk of developing diabetes for both men and women is now similar to that of a never-smoker (2001 study).    13 yearsThe average smoker lucky enough to live to age 75 has 5.8 fewer teeth than a non-smoker (1998 study). But by year 13 after quitting, your risk of smoking induced tooth loss has declined to that of a never-smoker (2006 study).   15 yearsYour risk of coronary heart disease is now that of a person who has never smoked. Your risk of pancreatic cancer has declined to that of a never-smoker (2011 study - but note a 2nd pancreatic study making an identical finding at 20 years).     20 yearsIf a female, your excess risk of death from all smoking related causes, including lung disease and cancer, has now reduced to that of a never-smoker (2008 study). Risk of pancreatic cancer has also declined to that of a never-smoker (2011 study).http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html     Nicotine Addiction 101      Tips For Gaining Freedom From Nicotine Addiction    Caring For Your Quit    Nicodemon’s Lies    My Cigarette, My Friend     Are You A Nicotine Junkie?  The Isolation Of A Widowed Smoker   The Law of Addiction    A Fate Worse Than Death     The Smoker's Vow    Gradual Withdrawal For Your Worst Enemy        Make a ticker/quit meter to track how many days you've been quit, how many cigarettes you've not smoked and how much money you've saved.  It's amazing to see how much money we've wasted on cigarettes, not to mention how many we've NOT SMOKED.  You can make them right here on our forum.http://www.quittrain.com/tickers/  Allen Carr’s Easy Way      I’m a huge advocate of Allen Carr’s book and highly recommend that everyone give it a read.  Study the book as if you’re taking an exam in college and have to pass the course.  Study it some more.  Grasp the concept that cigarettes do nothing for you and you’re not giving anything up by quitting.  I’ve been carrying Allen Carr’s book around with me like Linus toting his blanket.  Remarkably, the book and the blanket serve the same objective.   Something written in the foreward, by Damian O’Hara, really hit home.  Previously the book had been used as an apparatus; direction and information which laid the prep work for success.  This time, the well-worn paperback means a little more to me than just a revelation.  Here is the lucid sentence that brought me back home.   “In fact, like many smokers, I came to see the cigarette as my best friend, my ‘me’ time, my island of peace and tranquility in a crazy world, my ever present companion.”     Ah yes, this crazy, messed up world in which we live.  My crazy place in time still remains and smoking didn’t change it, ease it or make it more tolerable.  All it did was leave me with regret.  I can’t go back and undo what has been done but I can move forward.  The good news is that I didn’t go back to where I had left off and quitting now is simply like dropping junk-mail into the recycling bin.  I first saw the video clip below of Allen Carr speaking about his Easy Way to stop smoking.  I was intrigued enough to buy his book, “Easy Way To Stop Smoking”, and it was a game changer for me.  I never looked at smoked the same way again.  I never in my wildest dreams could have thought that quitting smoking could not only be enjoyable, but also easy.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TL2Vh7goJc
The Health Benefits Of Quitting Smoking Start As Soon As You Put Out Your Last Cigarette

http://quittrainblog.com/ Lots of current news about big tobacco as well as all of the criminal depositions etc.  Of course all of the quit smoking resources as well.  It's part of this message board. 
I found these videos extremely helpful the first two weeks of my quit. Daily Quitting Lesson Guide      Link to YouTube Featured Playlists for all of Joel Spitzer's Stop Smoking Videos I watched these like crazy, educating myself on the nature of addiction, how nicotine works on the body, and how deep breathing can help alleviate the cravings. Read, read, read, also, al the links/articles in the Newbie package and post lots of whiny, silly posts. Seriously. Everyone does. And you'll feel better. Make sure and for real, post an "SOS" when you get one of those "I have to SMOKE" cravings. Wait. Wait. Wait. People will answer you. Just hang on to the side of your monitor with clenched hands, and wait for your help. The Blood Sugar goes haywire the first 72 hours of withdrawal from nicotine. So, drink fruit juice regularly. Cranberry is great, but any juice, really. Hummus is my friend. Hummus. A weird dip made from something healthy. I use this and lots of vegetables that, when slathered with hummus, tastes good. And, I have only gained 2 pounds in 5 weeks of my quit. So far. lol. Ice Water and tick tacs, they help. And, most of all; WALK. Post and SOS, wait for the help, then walk. Anywhere. It helps tremendously. Make sure you get back to your people on the forum when you get back from your walk. They are waiting to hear from you. They worry. lol. That's worked for me, anyway,
I love Allen Carr.  The man is a saint.

I know I can not quit cold turkey, I will have to taper off. Has anyone tried using the nicotine gum or logenze  to replace ever other cigarette. For instance say you set your firstgoal of not smoking a cigarette for one hour and then increasing by 1/2 hour every 2 to 3 days and using the nicotine replacement when the urges become to strong until it is time to have your cigarette. Eventually you will reach a point where there will be several hours between smoking a cigarette. That will help with the psychological part of having something in your hands and other things. What do yoj guys think? I am open to suggestions because I have failed several times a just putting down cod turkey.
Hello lartomar2002 ,        That is exactly how i quit ,        I still use nicotine gums whenever i have a craving , with the sugar free nicotine gums alone i have avoided cigarettes for the past 2 plus months .        One gum can easily  keep you smoke free for at least 2 hours    I am sure after a week or two you can take away the nicotine gums too if you really wanted to .

This is the way to Freedom. Please learn all you can about nicotine addiction, please !     You may find this post helpful10 Ways To Effectively Use This Forum To Help Yourself Quit Smoking       The craving is nothing a human cannot handle.  You must power through them, that is all.    As our friend, Sirius, states,  "The next time a craving plunks down on your face ask yourself, "What price you are willing to pay to own yourself?"    Commit to NOPE, Not One Puff Ever and stick to it.  This is the way to build a successful quit.     Be very wary of dependence on gum or NRTs to do the work for you.   Nicotine is a poison.   You must deal with the addiction.   Cold turkey is nothing to be afraid of, it is one of the most successful methods of quitting.       As for cutting back ?  You will be poisoning yourself if you continue to smoke while on an NRT  and cutting back has it's own particular torture you will understand when you learn about the addiction.            I recommend you binge watch Joel Spitzer's videos to learn all you can about Nicotine addiction
Hey ,       I only commented about the nicotine gums because lartomar2002 asked about it        Anyway Good luck with the quitting process .        Everyone have a method of doing it .        The entire world is not doing the cold turkey method to quit smoking .
    Welcome lartomar and congratulations on deciding to take back your life. Many people here have been successful in using NRT's to quit smoking. However, they are meant to be used as a replacement for cigarettes and only for a short time, two to three months with a plan to reduce and eventually quit those as well. Smoking while using them is very dangerous so if you are going to use NRT to quit you need to do it instead of cigarettes and not in addition to...
Hello lartomer and welcome to the forum.  I smoked for 42 years and did not think I could quit.  I tried many different methods to quit, including NRT's.  I came across this forum and, with the help of the members here, I was able to quit cold turkey.  No matter how you quit, there is a period of discomfort. The first weeks is the toughest. Once the nicotine is out of your system, then you redirect you thinking.     Why don't you hang around and educate yourself about your addiction.  Stay close to the forum and get to know us.  We are a very supportive group of people, who have been where you are and weathered our way through. We want to help you.
    I used NRT...but never while smoking...I would push the time between gums out daily but never intermingled it with smokes.

You may not realise it but your addiction is just looking for a way to keep on smoking.      Choose a method and just go for it.         Lots of luck to you
    Whatever method you choose to quit, there will be a period of discomfort when you finally let go of the nicotine all together. NRT can be helpful in getting off the cigarette smoking habit. (It should not be used at the same time as smoking, though. Nicotine overdose is a very real danger.) Once you've gotten used to not having a cigarette in your hand, then you face getting off the addictive substance of nicotine. At some point, you will face withdrawal. There is no getting around it. It's up to you how soon you want to face it. Some people like to kick the cigarette habit first and then face the nicotine. Others like to get it all over and done with at once. Again, it's up to you how you choose to approach it.       I do recommend you learn as much as you can about nicotine addiction. That will help you formulate a plan for yourself. It will also help you to know what to expect at every stage in the process.     Quitting takes work. Cravings suck, there's no denying that. But a craving won't kill you. Cigarettes will. Remembering that makes the choice a little easier, I think. And you will find a ton of support here to help you get through the rough patches. Support has been key for me. I hope you will take advantage of all of the wisdom and encouragement you can find here.         
    I want to thank everyone for thir quick response. I be sticking around. I do have a problem with the forum though. I have it set to notify me when I get get a reply but I have not received any notification yet.

Ok..bit more detail now I'm out of the war zone (waiting room at hospital cas department)...        I knew I could not quit without some help. So I used NRT gum. But the day u started gum, I stopped smoking. I gave myself 3 months of NRT and that was it. I knew my addiction had 3 faces, emotional/social, psychological and physical. I knew breaking the habbit/routine would be harder for me than kicking the drug. What I know now, is that the two were linked, but facing all the social and emotional things I did with the crutch of an NRT gum was instrumental in getting me through. Do I regret not going cold turkey...yes in some ways I do BUT I do honestly believe I wouldn't still be here now without the NRT.   So once I decided to commit to my quit I had an exit strategy in place for the NRT...from the third day I pushed the envelope...first gum of the day, space between gums, spacing normal chewies in between NRT ones...then having 2 for each one NRT...        Identify why you can't quit without an NRT and then you will know if it's suitable.Edited 4 hours ago by notsmokinjo
    I’m new here but I believe in getting help and support from people who understand. I’ve recently gotten sober from alcohol and am very grateful for the new take on life. I want to be smoke free too.. addiction free. I find that cigarettes are doing to me what alcohol used to. I don’t want to continue but have never lived without a crutch. I keep trying to quit on my own but find it’s not working. So I’m reaching out for help hoping that someone with similar experience and advice will reach back. 
Welcome gabbie and congratulations on your sobriety. I was a little confused by your quit date and thought you were coming up on a year quit. Have you set a date to quit smoking yet?  I can tell you that I was a 35 year smoker and am convinced I wouldn't have succeeded without the support of others who knew what I was going through at any given moment and could encourage me and let me know it was normal. You will find that here with us. We have lots of good tips, educational topics and even videos. Then if you just want to get your mind off the misery head to our social sections and check those forums out.   Quitting smoking is doable and we're all proof, so stick close, we're glad you're here
    You’ll find a familiar mantra here- one day at a time.  You’ll also find valuable insight and support here.  Welcome!  
Thank you for the welcome . I appreciate it. My quit date this time is Dec 8, 2019. I will stick close. I willing to learn. Thanks
Welcome aboard, GabbieGirl! Good for you! As L4L stated above...it's one day at a time when it comes to addictions...although I will admit in the beginning for me it was one minute at a time...when I finally made it to about 4 months quit is when I found my first online support group and I believe it has made all the difference in keeping the quit going strong...read everything you can on this site, watch the Joel videos and participate in the forums...and remember to NOPE every day!
    Glad you have a quit date. Forgive me if I'm being too personal but did you make a quit date for stopping drinking? The reason I ask is that, for me, setting a quit date never worked. As the day got closer and closer I would either smoke more or put it off just one more day or week or month or year.    I suggest you just bite the bullet and let's get this started  We will be here for you and give you all the support you could need or want 
Hl Welcome      Ditto to what Jillar said.  It only hurts till you get to about 3 weeks quit  after that its just a matter of willpower.        If you start now your 3 weeks will be over by Xmas which time of the year is full of temptations and excuses.
    Welcome gabbie!  Congratulations on the huge accomplishment of becoming sober.  If you can do that, you can quit smoking.  Life is so much better living it free of addiction.  This is a great place for support and help.  Stay close to the forum and shout out when you need us.
    I, along with the others, encourage you to quit smoking NOW.    The stress and anxiety that comes with an approaching quit date can easily derail your best intentions.     Addiction is nothing to play with.  Clear you head, make a commitment to NOPE (Not One Puff Ever) and stand by, with all your being, your choice to quit smoking.   This is one of the best decisions you will ever make.       You know how good and in control you feel being sober ? (congratulations, btw)  Well, being free of nicotine will bring you even more inner power, self-confidence and a profound trust in yourself.        Education is an essential component of a successful quit so read EVERYTHING you can and watch all the videos.   Knowledge of nicotine addiction explains so much of what we go through and what to expect.      Here are invaluable resources from our friend, Joel Spitzer, Daily Quitting Lesson Guide        and     you may find this thread helpful, Ten Ways To Effectively Use This Forum To Stop Using Nicotine     There is all the support you may need here.  We are all committed to putting our addiction to sleep and we have some fun along the way.     Please avail yourself to what we offer and make the decision to quit asap...you need poison yourself no longer, Freedom is delicious.       NOPE-ly yours,  S    
    Welcome to Quit Train, Gabbie.  Congratulations on becoming sober as well as deciding to quit smoking.  A smoke free life is a great thing and we are all here to help support you.     Read up on nicotine addiction on this site and keep participating on the boards.  It really helps.      It is great to have you here.
    I didn’t have a quit date for alcohol. I just couldn’t go on one sec longer. I do believe it’s the same with cigarettes. Half measures have never gotten me anywhere. I have started reading info on this site and I will continue. Thank you for the input and support. It’s vital. I really appreciate it ! 
@GabbieGirl I don't have much advice to add to what's already been said, but I wanted to welcome you to the Train and to say that I know what it's like to be afraid of giving up your "crutch." I have always had a crutch, since I was a kid. For years it was food, then shopping, then cigarettes, and when I quit cigarettes it went back to food again. (I have bipolar and anxiety disorders, and living without a crutch is, for me, intensely difficult.) I think the only reason I never got addicted to alcohol is that I never liked the taste very much.       Learning to live life without masking uncomfortable feelings takes a lot of dedication...and support. Support you can find here. The dedication you find within yourself. It's there, I promise you. Sometimes it takes reaching a breaking point to uncover it. It sounds like that was the case with alcohol for you. Other times, it's wanting to avoid that breaking point that causes us to become dedicated to making change.     For example, this year I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that attacks the lungs. I went through a period of several weeks where I struggled to breathe. Fortunately for me, that particular symptom went into a kind of remission after a while, but it scared me straight. I will never take another puff of anything other that fresh air ever again. Because I don't want to wait until I've reached the breaking point of COPD, other lung disease, or cancer before I quit smoking. I know now what it's like to struggle for air. So I'm dedicated to living a smoke-free life.      I did, however, return to food as a crutch to get me off the cigarettes. I did what I had to do to protect my lungs. But now I'm ready to make changes in my diet, as well, because my autoimmune disease is making me miserable, and the one thing I can control is what I put into my body.       It's all about taking back control. Which isn't easy, I know.       Once I give up my addiction to food, I'm going to be left without a crutch. And that thought scares me a lot. I'm going to have to face my depression and anxiety and the trials and tribulations of life without that self-comforting mechanism. I'm working on finding healthier ways of consoling myself. And this is also where having a support system comes in really handy. I'm sticking close to the forum here and to my supports in the 3D world and asking for help when I need it. And I want you to know you can reach out to me for help anytime. I'm here to listen without judgement and to share any insights I've gained from my own experience with addiction. I know there are many others here who are willing to do the same.     Wow, I ended up rambling on longer than I intended to!      Welcome, and I hope to see more of you!
On 11/20/2019 at 10:23 PM, GabbieGirl said:             I’m new here but I believe in getting help and support from people who understand. I’ve recently gotten sober from alcohol and am very grateful for the new take on life. I want to be smoke free too.. addiction free. I find that cigarettes are doing to me what alcohol used to. I don’t want to continue but have never lived without a crutch. I keep trying to quit on my own but find it’s not working. So I’m reaching out for help hoping that someone with similar experience and advice will reach back.        Welcome to the Quit Train Gabbie.       Any transformative process you successfully accomplish will have carryover effects.  The means and methods employed in quitting drinking will be similar, if not identical, to those needed to quit smoking.  Quitting one addiction is good practice for quitting other addictions.        After I quit smoking, I reduced the amount I drank and eventually gave up alcohol altogether.  With one quit under my belt, the next quit was a breeze.  Experience is the best teacher.        You know you have the ability to quit, now it's just a matter of getting to it.  Commit and conquer.
    Welcome aboard Gabbie! How awesome that you are sober and have decided to quit smoking! Treat the forum as you would do with aa meetings and the sober compagnions, post whenever you feel like it, no shame! We have your back!

Hi there, this is me introducing myself. First time here,  but not new to this whole quitting thing. Have been smoking on and off since I was 15 (in my mid-thirties right now). My most serious quit lasted for three whole years. I am sweating carrots  (yes, in Holland we do that when we are afraid) by the thought alone, to start this journey all over again. I am not so sure how to handle it this time. I feel like I know everything there is to know  and still don't feel confident enough. In the past I used to read a lot about addiction, fear, etc. I bought different kinds of cleansing tea, drank water until I became a water balloon, tried to meditate and then always ended up failing miserably. I have a history of depression and anxiety. I also have the experience of becoming calmer and much more relaxed at non-smoking life, but only gradually after the first year. I know it will take time. I know I want to take that time. And still I am terrified.  My quit date is next friday, 24-09-2018. I shall look around a bit, hopefully it will motivate me. I do not need willpower or pride, but faith. That much I know..
Welcome My life....,    If you want to have a successful quit your must do one thing.   Commit to never taking another puff EVER.  Not One Puff Ever.   It is that simple.  No need to harbor fear....you are seeking Freedom.      Even if you think you know all there is to know about addiction and quitting smoking....you must educate yourself MORE.     Read until your eyes bleed.  Watch the scary movies.    All will serve to empower you.      Have a look at 10 ways to effectively use this forum help you stop smoking      Why are you waiting to quit ?   If the decision is made...why not jump in ? Thinking too much isn't helpful and taking positive action is empowering.Edited August 22, 2018 by Sazerac
    Hi and welcome..    I agree with all the above post....knowledge....you fight the monster with knowledge....    You have to want to quit ...moré than you want to  smoke....    Being a part of a forum is a wonderful tool.... Positive attitude...    Why wait ???    Why put more poison in your body ....throw them in the bin and NOPE.... You can do it ...
Welcome to the forum!  You have to make up your mind that there is absolutely no circumstance that it is okay to smoke.  It is okay to cry, scream, rant, rave, punch things, be depressed, shower 5 times a day (you can't smoke in the shower) but it is NOT okay to smoke...EVER!!  Quitting can be uncomfortable, even miserable sometimes, but IT WILL NOT KILL YOU.  The alternative will.
Welcome My Life..... one day at a t time... just one day. Every morning I quit for the day... and they have started to string together nicely... I'm not worry about tomorrow or 2 years from now in relation to the quit I am just worrying about the next 24 hours. I have found focusing just on 24 hours at a time has been a big factor with this quit and much less stressful.        There are a few of us here who have anxiety and depression issues. You are so right, the anxiety is better to manage smoke free, I am already feeling the benefits of that. You know with you that really kicks in at the 12 month mark so you know that is what you have to look forward too.      So do all the reading again. Read as much as you can. Watch the videos. Watch public service anti smoking ads. You have the power within you to get rid of this addiction. Write down your list of reasons  for quitting and stick them on the fridge or somewhere you can see them when you need a boost.      I love "sweating carrots" that is a great saying... I think it would be much nicer to sweat carrots than it is to "shit bricks" which is what we do in Australia.    So keep your head high, post if you need, as often as you need and promise yourself NOPE (not one puff ever) even if its just for the day.... then make that promise again the next day.    With you quit date is it 24 August or 24 September?
    Welcome my life, congrats on taking back your life! I wish I had of quit in my mid thirties, you are very wise to do so. With a three year quit under your belt you have experience with how good quitting is and also how tough those first two or three months can be. Stay close, post NOPE and be sure to reach out to us with an SOS if you feel yourself caving to a crave. You can do it  
My life, you can do this.  I was in your shoes a few months ago -- I was more afraid of the idea of  quitting than anything else and that controlled me for 44 years.  I just decided to believe in my-self and took the leap of faith.  It wasn't the easiest thing but I just took it one day at a time and lots of cold water, and taking the daily "NOPE" pledge each and every day -- it really does work.  Take the leap, we will be here to help you the best we can.
Thanks a lot, all of you. My set date was 24-09, next friday. But I decided to follow through this evening and I emptied my package. So... tomorrow will be my first day of lots, with more air, fresher kisses,  clean clothes, white teeth. Threw away ashtrays, lighters and empty boxes. Chance is I curse myself tomorrow morning, so I wrote the list with reasons to read immediately when I wake (I used to make coffee and start my day puffing). My panic eased a bit, that's nice. I know what I am doing this for. I need to keep in touch with that. I do really want to free myself, although there will be times my nicotine wired brain will tell me otherwise.         Thanks again and I'l be back.
Good for you My Life -- these are strong and great steps to be taking to take your life back --  Remember to come here often (for research, to reach out to others or just to have some fun).  And remember drink lots of cold water and do the daily "NOPE" -- it really did work for me, as I stated before!!!!!!!Edited August 22, 2018 by Martian5
    Lots of good advice already My, so for now will just welcome you on board and wish you strength.        Hope to see you around.
    Welcome to the board, My life.  Congrats on throwing out the smokes and quitting now.       Don't be afraid to reach out to us if you need any help or support.  That is what we are here for.

Start tomorrow off with a pledge of NOPE    and drink your cafe in a different place just to switch things up.  I think you have avoided a lot of anxiety by quitting early and can use the momentum to carry you through the coming days.      You don't smoke anymore !
Welcome aboard. I want to tell you my first quit was also in my 30`s and lasted about as long as yours. Divorce got me started again or so I told myself and I was a musician in Las Vegas lounges and everyone smoked for the most part. Casino`s full of smoke back then and it was part of the lifestyle. Fast forward 30 years plus. I am 68 and this is the first quit that lasted any length of time. Almost 2 years and it`s going to last. I want you to think about making this quit stick for good and tell you if you do you have a good chance of avoiding health problems I have that are smoking related. Heart stints, poor circulation, and high blood pressure. I wish so strongly that I would have stayed strong back then and avoided what I have gone through that is smoking related and who knows what lurks around the corner. Make it stick this time. Your still young enough that the damage can be repaired. My best wishes to you.
    Well, I survived the very first morning (ofcourse). Started reading the list I wrote but I was surprised how distant it felt. I anticipated that, it has always struck me how big of a gap there can be between 'I will never do this again' and 'Ahh, give me that smoke, I'll try another day'. Drank tea instead of coffee, hugged the boyfriend and then started panicking. Like, for real. It suddenly hit me, I was not going to smoke all day, not feeling normal, not .....etc. etc.   After half an hour of adrenaline and anxiety I managed to calm myself down. Apart from being a bit dizzy I feel ok right now. :) 
    I'm glad you are feeling OK right now. It's good to avoid getting too far ahead of yourself early on, it can be overwhelming. The one day at a time, one hour at a time approach really does work, as long as you keep repeating it. It is why I still come here every day to commit.       You are doing great, stay strong! 
Just wanted to pop in with a big, fat, coffee fueled CONGRATULATIONS!!  You are taking back your life! This is your second chance! Please take it, use it, use us!!     The next few days are nothing but detox...give yourself some space and time to go thru the motions of grief, guilt, depression, but please know all of these are temporary symptoms of your quit.   Right now, you wrap that baby quit up in all those reasons on your quit list, all the love from your family, and you keep it close. Grow, baby quit, grow!       Edited August 23, 2018 by c9jane29
    Congratulations !   You might find this thread useful....it is about all our tricks surviving the first few days nicotine freeYour first days nicotine free
    I think I'll adopt this 'one hour a day' attitude. I like it. I used to see it so big, 'never again', almost uninmaginable. Today went surprisingly ok. Dizzyness, a bit fuzzy because of no cafeïne. I wasn't totally 'there'. But I still have my job,  my boss and collegues don't suddenly think I suck at it, I am able to drive without smoking. I cried only once (it kept coming for half an hour though  ). 
Congratulations on your first day quit mylife  Now you'll need to change your quit date to August 24 instead of September 24
Oh. Wow !!...   I'm late on here today..... Huge congrats to you for putting those cancer sticks down for good...   First week is tough...we call it hell week...your body is getting rid of all the nicotine...it takes 3 days...that's all to rid yourself of old nico once and for all...    Stay strong...post here as many times as you want...we are here for you..   Definitely NOPE every day....this tool is gigantic...   I'm proud of you ...
    Welcome aboard MyLife.  Congratulations on taking the plunge and freeing yourself of the smokes.        Today truly is the first day of the rest of your life.
    Welcome!!! We are all here and know how hard this is. I myself had a minor health scare that made this quit so much easier. You can do it and it ultimately comes down to mind over matter. One of the members put it to me like this - I get to be smoke free ! This is rewarding, not to be a smoker. There truly is no benefit in it. Congratulations  you got this!!’
    Also, I suffer from anxiety and I must say it has been so much better with me not smoking   benefits of being smoke free!!! Oh and I can breathe better!

Oeps,  something went wrong up ^there^. So, day 2. Today I have the day off. Slept for almost 10 hrs,  and I still feel like going back again. Body is working hard to get rid of nicotine and cafeïne. Edgyness is on it's way. I feel a bit blown up, though I am carefull not to over-eat. And yep,  while I write this I'm like, ohh just get on with it already and don't wine. Arghh it's all coming back to me, previous quits. I need to go read the letter of reasons, NOW. It's 10:38, let's make it to 11:38.
11:38

    You are more powerful than the nicotine addiction.  Hold fast to your resolve and  as our friend, Sarge, says,Embrace The Suck.

If you have a tortoise, race it.  I avoided humans as much as possible since I wasn't a very good-natured quitter, but some prefer to get out and interact, particularly with other non-smokers.    Spoil yourself and do as much or as little as you please  on your days off -- read, write, exercise, sleep, and come here to post or play games and laugh, cry and whine all you want.
Let your body dictate what it needs my life. if that means sleep, sleep. Eat, then eat. It's working hard already to get that nicotine out and try to start fixing the damage done so go easy on yourself and listen to your body Edited August 24, 2018 by jillar
    Take it one minute at a time if need be.... Do anything...just don't smoke... Even if your arse is on fire ..?
    Well, the monster has been unleashed.   Is it ok to continue writing here or should I start a diary or a blog?      Ughhhh this ... this bloody thing comes in waves: panic, sadness, edgyness, the idea of missing out, tired and restless at the same time. Gauloises, you looked so sexy and grown-up when I first met you, long loooong time ago. But now I see, you made me an ordinary addict. Bleghhh
    You write wherever you want to my life. I found it totally helped me in the early days AND you'll have something to look back on when you get farther along. Hang in there, it will get better. I promise 
    My life, you're doing the right thing by posting here often.  And setting small targets.        You're doing it.  Promise to post an SOS before lighting up - it has saved many a quit and it really works.  We will stand by you as you overcome the crave.
    Post and write wherever you want and whenever you want.  Venting about what you are going through is a great way to release a lot of the early anxiety you are feeling.  Just keep fighting through it.  Things do get better.

    I wouldn't worry about eating too much if it "Gets You Through The Night" unless it is seriously health related. Your on the right track and you`ve been here before. Stay strong and best wishes.
Day 3. I realised I will have to put some effort in debunking my addict thoughts. Yesterday evening I thought: I will become the most boring person on the planet. This thought caused  a rollercoaster of feelings. Last time I quit (for about half a year) it was depression (and fear of becoming even more depressed) that led me back to smoking. I think these unadressed addict thoughts played a huge role in that.    Ok, so I think I will become the most boring person on the planet. Mantra: 'I will become more at peace with myself'.   (And, note to self, what is exciting about lighting fire to something in your mouth? ). I convinced myself it was cool to smoke, when I was 13/14 years old. Plain simple as that. Right now, I do not need to identify with this disruptive thought. I can let it pass.
    After today......no nicotine in your body...always think of the positives....   Quitting is full of positives...    I'm sure your far from boring ...   Keep going ....

Once you acknowledge the big lie that addiction encompasses, it is nearly impossible to lie to yourself about anything. Quitting smoking reveals many inner truths.     One lie your addict is using is, you will become more depressed if you quit smoking.  This is bullshit. Smoking only feeds on our depression it doesn't cause depression.  Quitting smoking is life affirming and leads to many powerful inner changes, all good !  Lies lies lies.  Lies that you are boring.  Lies that smoking is cool.  Our addict has a million of them.       Have a look at this,Romancing The Cigarette andRed Flags        Congratulations on your Third Day ! PLEASE reward yourself !    A whole lot of nicotine has left your body. YOU don't smoke anymore !
Thanks @Sazerac. You are absolutely right. I clearly remember how thrilled I was with myself and with what I archieved after one year. More aware, less dissociation, my body felt mine again. Thats where I want to be again. But to be there I will have to acknoledge these lies and not just fare on willpower. Pfiew. Such a long way to go. Or maybe that's also not true? And am I closer already than I would think?        As for now, I did grocery shopping. A huge trigger because I don't like shopping AT ALL. Made it through though. 3rd day. Yay!  I'll reward myself with a good piece of chocolate. I am thankfull for this forum. I couldnt possibly bother friends or boyfriend with all these contemplations...
@My life, my recovery   Hi !    If you have not listened/read to Allen Carr Easy Way to Stop Smoking, I absolutely recommand it.    I am very proud of you staying free of suffocation. One thing that helped me some time ago was thinking about craving and withdrawal as a recovery, always said to myself that it is normal to feel like that, this is my body recovering, nothing to worry, just embrace this journey thinking that somehow "no pain no gain". I am sure that you have done hard things before, and this is far from being that hard.  I like to keep in mind what Sadhguru said once about the smoking, this helped me some time ago, so maybe it will help you too "Smoking is not good or bad. You can't say it is, but it's foolish, always remember that this machine we have was never designed to inhale smoke , so you are doing something against your nature, which is foolish". Wish you good luck and I will be on the some road with you tommorow, just few steps behind. All smokers want to quit, remember that, you can succed. One day at a time , or maybe even better 3h at a time, and it is unbelivable easy, never think about not smoking a cigar ever again, even if you want that, don't look at the tip of the mountain, it will seem impossible to get there, just look at the next step you have to make , next minute, hour.
37 minutes ago, My life, my recovery said:              Thanks @Sazerac. You are absolutely right. I clearly remember how thrilled I was with myself and with what I archieved after one year. More aware, less dissociation, my body felt mine again. Thats where I want to be again. But to be there I will have to acknoledge these lies and not just fare on willpower. Pfiew. Such a long way to go. Or maybe that's also not true? And am I closer already than I would think?                                As for now, I did grocery shopping. A huge trigger because I don't like shopping AT ALL. Made it through though. 3rd day. Yay!  I'll reward myself with a good piece of chocolate. I am thankfull for this forum. I couldnt possibly bother friends or boyfriend with all these contemplations...           You already identify the lies, Mlmr !  The lies will not serve you anymore. Now it is time to power through temporary anxieties and nurture yourself.   Quitting smoking is a big friggin' deal but, ultimately do-able.    Celebrate each and every crave you wrench from the addict.  Your thoughts will soon be COMPLETELY your own and have NOTHING to do with nicotine addiction.      You are winning.    Chocolate is delicious. :-)
I owe half my quit to good chocolate! It helps release dopamine and reinforces the good behavior of not smoking.    It sounds like you're making your second chance count MLMR!     I read (Dr.Phil, I think) that any kind of severe abuse (mental, physical, sexual, drug) can actually retard growth at the age when the abuse began...so, of you started smoking around 13/14, that's the last time you really processed emotions. There WILL be a grace period for getting ahold of this and understanding how to have emotions even.  All this to say: be mad, be sad, be happy (B12 shots help), be the new non-smoking you with NO shame!!
    Hi mylife, you may find your self esteem start to skyrocket the farther you get into your quit like I did. And if anything it's the smokers sitting in their huddle smoking that are boring because they're missing out on what's going on inside. You never have to be that person again  Enjoy your chocolate, I was hooked on soft peppermint puffs lol
    After reading @Sazerac's suggestions (Romancing the cigarettes and Red flags) I thought about my warning signs. I think writing them down will help me see them for what they really are: whoppers.     Yesterday I encountered one of my most crucial ones: "I'll become a boring person if I never smoke again". Obviously, NOT TRUE. How is addictive, repetative smoking making me an exciting person? Day after day after day, just because I háve to? What is exciting though, is breaking through that circle. That's what I'm doing right now. Besides that, if it were to be true... excuse me, but I could really use some boredom now and than       Another one, frightingly strong sometimes: "oke, you showed the world you are able to quit. Woohoo. Now stop that nonsense, don't be so damn proud of yourself and get the smokes already. You know it's what you want". Personally, I find this the worst. I can't wrap my head around it. Somehow this thought can get to me, the way a good (but evil...)  friend talks to you and you appreciate and believe their words. I know it's not true. And still, it must have something to do with my own insecurity in general. Is it as simple as believing you can...? And by that, chasing away this thought?         I had a long talk with my boyfriend the other night, about meditation, going through fears and all, self compassion. We often had discussions about quitting and me being so afraid. He's been with me before when I took the plunge, back then he just couldn't understand why it took me so long to feel normal again and to ease the depression. My willpower is crazy though.. and it just dawned on me that that's what might get in my way, strangely enough. Im so afraid to see myself as... ok, to be alone with all this fuss in my head, to welcome my emotions so to speak. That's why I never gave meditation  good chance, it seems just to scary. And though I have come a long way the past years, quitting smoking seems to ask for an even gentler approach... hmmmmm.         
@c9jane29 especially the real dark chocolate, that's my favorite. And yes, I shall learn new ways to deal with emotions. Hopefully with more grace than the embarassing fight with my significant other, yesterday night...  @jillar you are so right!

You can't say it is, but it's foolish, always remember that this machine we have was never designed to inhale smoke , so you are doing something against your nature, which is foolish".

✔day 4 ✔    Today I told myself:    * going out for dinner is fun and I am blessed that  I am able to.  * taking a long walk without smoking is just as good, even better. It's just... a walk. * doing dishes does not have to be rewarded with a smoke, the clean kitchen is the reward in itself.    * I had my first coffee in 3,5 days and it was delicious. 'I can't drink coffee without a cigaret' turned out to be a big fat lie! Edited August 26, 2018 by My life, my recovery
    @work, but I thought, I have to jump in for a second and make room for my thoughts. I think a lot about smoking today. And my schedule is too busy take my time for these thoughts. But if I don't do it at all, I'll be dead tired tonight. So here goes...    * It's a lie that I can't do my job properly without smoking.  I am good at what I do.      * It's a lie that I need smoking to ease my mind. I know number of ways to relax when I need to: tea, breathing, going outside and getting REAL fresh air/oxygen. Chewing on a delicious variety of tomatoes, cucumber, carrots, eggs, an apple, banana... oh joy!      * It's a lie that I loose my focus after a while, when I don't smoke. I'm still adjusting so maybe I am distracted easily this week, but apart from that my concentration is just fine. Smoking is an addiction. Agitation is something that's caused by smoking, not something that was there already and one can cure by smoking.
    Spot on My life, you are doing this just right. Good job on your quit to date!
    Your lies are all of our lies, they are the lies of addiction.  Good on you for exposing them....you can't be fooled anymore, you know too much !   Take extra good care of yourself and lavish yourself with rewards, this jump starts your brain's pleasure centers to run for YOU and not nicotine.
    Mylife - your entries here are inspiring me!! Thank you!! You are doing amazing
@Sslip thank you @Sazerac it's comforting to know that we all sort of deal with the same lies. It's easier for me to make it less personal and less of an 'it's my own fault'thing. While still taking responsability  for MY quit. Thanks for your support.@Christa326 good to know . I have not much looked into other blogs/stories, still have to find my way around here. But I believe I read that you are somewhere in your second week or so?
    Once you see smoking for what it is...a addiction....and understand the addiction... Quitting becomes alot easier....

I am nearing my 5-days mark. I am happy about that because it means that before  I know it, I will have the first week under my belt.       The past five days my fear of depression has almost vanished. That's extraordinary and a bit uhm, unusual as well. Where other people are sure they will gain at least 60 pound (and heck, that fear feels realistic), my quit fear has always been the sadness and the darkness. I won't dwell on it for too long, but trust me. For me, that fear is about life and death. I carry a heavy heart... and worked my ass off all these years to make it lighter. And now, I suddenly am not so sure anymore about quitting and depression. I question the relation between the two. That's ... HUGE!!!. Imagine... what if I could do this without hitting rock bottom again? How awesome would that be, to see this addiction for what it is? Ahhhh. While I write this, I hear this little voice, it says: 'Hah! Being cocky and everything, well girl, just wait for it! I'll get you some!'. I think I will continue listening to Allen Carr's audiobook and give this voice a taste of his own medicine.        Going to bed early. Last night was crap. I have never been able to sleep well for the first months of quitting and I do know that has a great impact on my moods. I tried everything from late night walks to baths, super gross lavender sleep tea and listening to delta waves. I would like to hear your golden tip, if you have one!
The best sleep I get is when I go for a late night swim. My local pool is open until 10:30 pm most of the week and the swim tires me and quietens the mind.

    I took a otc night time bayer a couple times a week and that worked to get my sleep pattern back on track. You're doing great mylife  
    You are doing great, Mylife.        Thanks for keeping us updated on your progress.  Your posts are very inspiring.     Keep up the awesome work!
    Rutavala and Underwood essential oils help me sleep, also lavender...
    Or for Pete's sake CEDARWOOD not Underwood whatever that is!
I'll be needing those tips, tonight was awfull. Slept  few hours, then woke up, doze off, only to wake 20' later to stare at the ceiling for the rest of the night. I am worried, I hoped that during this quit my sleeping pattern would not be so badly influenced. Sleep is my main trigger in moodswings...         Head up high, off to work. Day 6.
    My life, I'm afraid I'm just about to give you the stupidest bit of advice. Try to relax about the sleep. I know it is a real pain while struggling with the early quit insomnia and all people adjust at different rates, but for me it lasted no longer than two weeks.       The point? Well, really just to say it is temporary and passes. A couple of weeks after quitting I started sleeping better than I had done in years. No jumping out of bed at the first opportunity to get that desperate first fix of the morning.         You will get there soon, in the meantime there is no harm in temporarily using ANOTC sleep aid. 
I know you are right @Sslip. And at the same time it's the hardest thing to do, not worry about the lack of sleep when that same lack of sleep is such an issue.. I always try to say to myself, when I lay awake for 3 hours, my brain thinks I've slept 1,5. Lying down is resting as well. And I think what they say is true, during those insomnia nights you always sleep more then you are aware off, even when it's these little in-between-naps. I'll try to keep in mind that it might just be a few weeks...
OK before I started on my new medication (which has been making me sleep heaps) I was a chronic insomniac.... so much so that I didn't really notice a change with quitting.... I will take sleeping tablets when I need them because I could go for days on 1-2 hours of sleep and become completely irrational. I know a few people have used the night time cold and flu tablets to get through the insomnia stage. You know your the best one to make decisions about what you can and can't take but if a lack of sleep is going to push your resolve there are options.... the insomnia is an early stage thing from what I have read with others, as I said it was no different for me before quitting and after, so you can just push through this or you can try camomile tea or malted honey milk or see your doctor about a sleep aid.
    I breathe like @Boo and slow it down, way down.  I also tuck the palm of my thumb into my solar plexus. The rest will get you by, it is the anxiety about sleeplessness that has to go. Some people like guided meditation tapes.   Are your screens turned off ?  It is recommended that you stop watching telly or your computer for at least an hour before bedtime. OTC sleep aids work for me, and the Chamomile or Honey toddies from @notsmokinjo    When sleep is completely evasive, I get up and do something (NO computer or any screens). I am usually tired enough to sleep in an hour or so.  s
I am thankfull for all of your tips, I really do appreciate you all thinking with me and with eachother. I decided to call my doctor tomorrow morning and discuss this with her. In general, I avoid medication if I can, but... now is not a general occasion. And my sleep is worth a lot to me! I think I want to give it one week and if it's not any better by then I'll contact her again and then she can subscribe me something without an appointment, because she knows what's going on. @notsmokinjoyou said somehing about flu and cold tablets....? What's that? And @Sazerac you are right about the screens. Tonight I am going to walk for one hour, then take a shower and go to bed. There will be no screens involved        Today I had some new triggers to digest. Holiday season is over, so there was a lot of traffic. Queing, no cigaret... ugh. Instead, I started thinking about how I can remove the stench from my house on wheels. I might make a project out of that, next weekend. Many people asked me today how I am doing and although I think it's sweet, it was a bit too much. While I told them I'm doing surprisingly well, I'm like.... ahhh I want to run away for a cigaretbreak. So... went to the restroom and thought about what was really going on: I'm just not so good at being the center of attention. Besides that, I know the way it works... people will forget about it in some time, but for me the journey continues. And somehow that thought made me feel alone and thus craving for a smoke. This addiction has interesting ways of work...       Lies debunked today:    * I can't be in traffic jam without smoking. Well.... yes, ofcourse I can. Unfortunately, traffic jam is traffic jam and I am in it, smoke or no smoke  * I will never be able to drink coffee at work again, without wanting to smoke. Uh... yes I can drink coffee and just continue with what I am doing. But... for the first time I realised how disgusting this machine coffee actually is. And since I have these sleep issues, I will rule out coffee anyway, for some time. Kinda strange, since I came from at least 6 mugs a day. I guess body and mind are adjusting and maybe it's my job to give in to that for now.      -edit- omg!!! Tomorrow evening it's a week already!!!Edited August 28, 2018 by My life, my recovery
    Those milestones are important @My life, my recovery. Make sure that as you reach them, you give yourself a little (or even big) treat. You will have earned it. 
    Late to the party, but congrats on the best choice ever.....keep on keeping on  Lisa
    Try Qi Gong !!!!    Find a  beginner class on You Tube....it's been a life saver for me...so relaxing and calms the mind....it does deep breathing too...   I do it every morning ...it's a great way to start the day....trust me !!!
Ok, last post before I turn off everything that blinds me with evil sleepless blue light. I just had a good walk with my best friend. There was crying, talking, sentiment, mud and a beautiful sky. Man, what a proces. Quitting smoking.  I have some things planned for the weekend. Finding out about Qi Gong       (@Doreensfree), arranging some natural air freshener for in my car and make a reservation schedule for the next half year, with people who own bathtubs         And now off to an hour screenless sleep-preparation. Which I don't worry about. AT ALL. Edited August 28, 2018 by My life, my recovery
    May you have the sweetest of dreams, life.  Talks with best friend are a balm, we are lucky with our friends.   This last full moon was a doozie...Mercury still pulsating in the sky here. I saw a bat last night :-)   I have a bathtub in my courtyard,it is a great place to see the sky.Have a good rest.Ditching the screens will take a few days to adjust but, it will really make your REM's better.Take your  melatonin (which I just discovered may be useful for the side effects of quitting smoking )and lay down with a peaceful smile on your face. S            
        Honest...? I feel like crap. Bad night again. Apparantly body was run over by truck tonight. Bleghhhh           
    I lost my sleep too...but like you I was told to work through it,all is temporary... And it was.... Keep fighting...hope Qi Gong helps too...before that..I had a punching pillow....lol...one extreme to the other.... Emotions are all over the place for a little while..but the reward is so worth it...
    Trying to stay positive, but today that's a bit too hard. Main goal is to survive this day in one piece I guess. One non-smoking piece, that is. I feel sad, unstable, foggy. Bleghh. I look forward to tonight, I'll be having dinner with a friend. Pancakes, let the comfortfood come my way please. I don't want no cucumber carrots and tomatoes anymore.   
    Enjoy that comfort food. Resolve to yourself to go through these crappy days just once. It won't be long until you get out the other side. That's a promise. 
You have 6 days to celebrate, M' Life ! The day will pass, your craves will pass.   You know how to power through, embrace the suck.    Look forward to your free life.
Hi all, meet Chamele,  my weird looking, big-eyed, somewhat scared baby quit. It's exactly one week old. I nurture it , raise it and now and then I spoil it. I'm afraid he's a bit unworldly and foggy sometimes. He might even scream for no apparant reason. There's no need to hide from him, he's not dangerous. He seems alert, afraid even. He has this cool habit of changing colours, lately he chooses different clothing every few minutes. It suits him for now. They say he will ease out when he grows up. I love him anyway.             Edited August 29, 2018 by My life, my recovery
    ^^LOVE IT!^^  
    Fabulous....you should call him / her...NOPE.....your quit needs just as much nurturing...x
    One week already! Congratulations MLMR!! Blow up some balloons and get this party started!!     Make sure to reward yourself and get that proud, fire in your belly feeling that You! Are! Doing! It!   (You should probably keep him off the pink sparkle glitter balloons...it'll confuse the heck outta the little guy)   
Help! It's 2:15 am and I have been awake since 11 already.  I know I shouldnt worry but it worries me so much anyway. I try to do deep breathing but when I start, I feel panic coming up so I go back to shallow breathing again immediately, I can't push through. Since four days I have this cramp in my neck/back, I think I am too tense about not sleeping, when I go to bed. It's the wellknown circle. I just can't have this, so afraid that the sleeplessness will trigger old things. I really want to believe that it's temporarily. Im still pretty sane, but when this continues I'm not sure how to handle. Smoking is not an option,  no way. I'm not worried about that. When I come home from work I don't have enough energy yet to do things like Qi Gong or making my bedroom a sleeping walhalla or even buying things like milk,  sleeping tea etc. I figure that I need to do these things next weekend.   Sorry but...for now it's just like this: Edited August 29, 2018 by My life, my recovery
    The insomnia thing sucks my life but it's only temporary so try to keep that in mind. Have you tried putting on a boring tv show? That helps sometimes if you dont want to try an OTC sleep aid.    I'm glad that smoking isn't a concern for you, progress is awesome isn't it 
Yes I tell that myself the whole time. It wont last forever, it's only temporary. It scares me that it's only been like this for four days and already has such an impact. It might take a while and somehow I need to accept that. Edited August 29, 2018 by My life, my recovery
Quitting itself is not so much of a problem. Have only had 2 or 3 really bad cravings since I started. I like reading about addiction, it helps me. I like debunking the addict thoughts and Im enjoying freshness and I am proud I am doing this again.  Really. Oh and allen Carr's audio Book is great. It's not your average romance or adventure but ok..      But this stupid sleepthing messes me up !!!!!!!!!       Temporary. Temporary. Temporary.
    You're doing great my life, be super proud of yourself. Soon you'll be sleeping like you've never slept before  Have you tried napping during the day to help make up some of your sleep? 
    I think when you are tired enough you will sleep.   Get cat naps whenever you can.  You have a great quit going, protect it.
Hang in there, just like you are! Awesome! I am on day 5....the opposite sleep problem....all I want to do is sleep !
    Sorry M ..having no sleep is tiresome...I was the same....spent many hours in the night here....stay strong...it will pass...but everyone is different ,so carnt tell you when this will happen...just be gentle with yourself...maybe nice warm baths with candles....soft music...hang in there...

These are some of the words/lines I wrote down last week (maybe translation is a bit off sometimes):        Sweet kisses. Breathing from my core. Smoking equals an insecure, empty feeling. Oxygen = O2. Freedom, pride, easily running the stairs when in a rush. Shiny hair. The cigarette gives nothing, but takes everything. Clean car. Pink lungs. 5 minutes rule rules!!! See through the brainwashing. Lillies.        ------------ silence is ok --------------       To be with what I feel. Just. Be. With. It. Adjusting.      Fresh laundry, peated whisky, waking up with a clean throat. This journey is a different one. It's now. It's ok to not know what needs to be done. Knowing isn't everything. HEALTH!!   Celebrate every day. It's not childish. It's knowing where I came from. White teeth, fresh clothes, younger skin, way more money to spend with the man I love, no more rushing out at restaurants. Yahoo self love!
The rewards start from day 1....and just keep on coming....
    good days   no smoke    bad days    no smoke    daytime no smoke    nighttime   no smoke        yay you.
In order to create a sleep sanctuary in my bedroom, I started by cleaning the windows inside and outside. Put the curtains in the machine, fresh sheets on the bed after cleaning the bed itself, vacuumd and mopped. Sorted out the closet, threw away junk that was just hangin' around there and spreading god-knows-what kind of occult dark energy.        Last night I slept ok, I think I got 6 hours. Got some energy back, good for sponging, scrubbing and cleansing my house. I think I have sharper taste already and my morning squeak has vanished! Also when I take a deep breath, I am able to uhhhhhh. How do I say that. Complete it? Finish it up to the point where my lungs feel full? Well, whatever. It's a joy, anyway.

It's a joy, anyway.     AH yes! the feeling of the deep breath! I know just what you are saying!!!!!!!!!! I was experiencing a lot of shortness of breath (paired w anxiety) but now that i haven't smoked in 18 days (who is counting?) i do NOT feel that and can breath like idk....a normal person? Congrats on this!!!!
    You guys are doing great and the benefits will just keep coming

They are not decreasing either, maybe when all is balanced out a bit more ..
    Thanks @jillar. I try to mention the benefits every day, part of staying committed to my quit.

I still have it especially in certain situations but it is much better without nicotine.        @jillar - thanks so much!!!!!!!!
    Here I go again. Emotions all over the place. Since late afternoon feeling  unsteady and on top of that, judgemental about it. And so addict thoughts pop up like weeds after a rain shower. Got to put them where they belong: the land of the fairy tales.        I will NOT feel better when I smoke. I will feel better when I start accepting myself more. Breathing out smoke is NOT soothing. After writing this, finishing laundry and then having a walk will calm me down. Driving to the gas station and buying cigarettes will NOT be like 'I don't care and even about that I don't care'. I want to care. I do care. And so I stay home. And do stuff that's actually good for me.             
    My life, I stayed close to home my first month or two and only ventured out when my hubby could go with me because I didn't trust myself not to give in. You are doing EVERYTHING right!  
    Your brain and body are being reconfigured. This is a great opportunity to learn a lot about yourself and what to change or how to adapt.   Be kind to yourself and lavish yourself with all kinds of rewards to reclaim your endorphins...wrench them away from nicotine's power. 
    No extra points for making quitting harder.  Shut down the addict thoughts a fast as possible.  Tell yourself to move on.

The addiction or the ways we have to deal with fighting, accepting and finally living with it

Today will be day 10. Sounds good to me. Amidst all of the fuss there's one steady factor:  not smoking today!Edited August 31, 2018 by My life, my recovery

Day eleven: completed. Did the swimming bear, waving reed, I flied and made waves. Quit Gong, so to speak. Made me relaxed and I want to incorporate it into morning- and evening rituals.      Heading towards 2 weeks, next wednesday evening. I'm on the right track, education is making some room now for deeper breathing and stretching. Although I'm still edgy, I have a kind of new calm. I'm somewhat easier in arguments and am feeling less agressive. Because hey, I've killed almost twice, last week.. and today I 'solved' an argument by leaving the situation and shouting bitchy statements through the wall. Progression       Long story short... let's continue!
    Fantastic update My Life, you're doing a great job so far, so keep it going.
    Long﻿﻿﻿﻿ story s﻿h﻿ort... le﻿t'﻿s cont﻿inue!﻿       Great post M !!!....upwards and onwards !!!
    Ok, for some reason I'm having a difficult moment, just a few quick words to reassure myself.   * don't want to go back to craving, spending meetings waiting for a moment to get out and smoke, losing money over a body- and soul destroying addiction.   * I am going to book the sauna  * I will make myself tea when I come home, cook dinner and do a flying bear, wild goose or flowing river.   *  ................................................................. * <--  quit smoking leaves room for new things!!!
    Here's one for yousex health money and time
    *smoking can not, will not, does not, has not ever done anything for you.   We smoked because we were well trained nicotine slaves.     Congrats on KTQ...it truly honestly does get better!
    Love the positive affirmations my life, you so got this girl

15 minutes ago, My life, my recovery said:              KTQ....?!               KTQ = Keep The Quit
The past 30 hours I learned some valuable lessons.      * https://purrli.com is a great website to ride out panic attacks, especially when breathing exercise fails  and your'e too frozen to comfort yourself. Or when you like cat purring but are having cat allergy.    * asking for help when unable to reach own self, is worth gold. I used to think that being that close to smoking meant assured failure. But being that close to smoking ánd reaching out, while everything about that act feels uncomfortable and awkward, is a major thing.    * starting Qi Gong and over-doing the flying bear, wild waves, loose goose, poisenous snake etc. might not be such a good idea, early on during quitting. There's a change you'd spoil all the Qi you have left and thus freak out. Takin' it nice and easy and maybe just start with a lazy buddha posture.    * KTQ = keep(ing) the quit. Which I did.
    You're doing a great job of expanding your learning and building on the tools that work for you. Really good work My life.      It's very useful to others that you are recapping what you have found beneficial. It's a smart way of filing all those handy lessons away for the next time you want to use them. 
Ok, risking the case that I might come across as manic... but I had yet anóther epiphany.       I was thinking, how do all my previous quits (of one month, half a year, one week, few days etc) differ from the one that lasted nearly three years and cost me, after a month or 10, 11, almost no effort? (and got spoiled by my total stupidity and arrogance, that of a first time quitter) And I suddenly realised.. for me it's about confusing being a quit smoker with being a non smoker. I always thought, addiction is forever. It's about not puffing anymore. And ofcourse that's correct. But that does not mean I remain a smoker who happens not to smoke, by choice. Because... I, uh...quit. oke, does this make sense? So, I am a non smoker with an addiction, not a quit smoker with an addiction. Maybe it's about getting into character after all. And by that, de-identifying myself from being 'a smoker'.            By now I am totally unsure if what I think comes from a clean brain or a deluted, crazed and sleep deprived  brain...  My thoughts run wild. I guess it's ok and part of the process
    It is okay to keep your mind running wild because you are changing your mindset for the good.  I think that the key to quitting the addiction is changing our mindset.  You sound perfectly logical to me!  Keep going girl.  Your are going to win this!
    It's perfectly 'normal' to have these kinds of thoughts.  Your body and brain are learning new ways of living.  By now, I'm sure you're at the point where taking a deep breath actually feels enjoyable rather than something that makes you cough.  I used to love that about quitting (and still do).        You're doing really well.  Keep posting here . Folks who tend to stay close to the board and share their experiences seem to have a greater chance of success.      Stay strong.

Non-smokers don't smoke so; there is nothing that would make me want to smoke because non-smoker doesn't smoke their problems away.  I had a pretty delicate situation happen in my early quit that forged my quit in fire; a test of my resolve and new found self esteem/awareness...those moments make a quit, so keep the powerful feeling of overcoming those urges in your heart to carry you thru the low times.  That said...it is party time!!! Glitter guns out! Cuz MLMR is learning how to quit!!    N.O.P.E.
@Linda Thomas yeah, thanks.  @d2e8b8 yes, had that this morning when I woke up. Somehow I still have the 'habit'  of coughing when I open my eyes after sleep, but there's not much left to cough, ha. Feels great! And the need to rush out for coffee and a cigarette is also disappearing. @c9jane29 thanks for sharing that about your early quit. I too believe these experiences can make us succesfull in what we try to achieve here. The relief of still being smokefree after a (mini) crisis is priceless. And relief turning in to pride, which is happening with me right now.     -edit- by the way, got to be carefull with this glittergun, tonight I am celebrating the two-week-birthday of baby quit Chamele.

I ended up reading stories of people who got lungcancer or other smoke related diseases. It brutally puts an end to any romanticizing of smoking. I'm 'lucky'  to be dealing with moodswings because of quitting, instead of batteling for my life because of continuing smoking.
Hi my life, mood swings are normal for us women in the early days/weeks of quitting. If you do need to see people maybe tell them you've quit smoking. Most people, non smokers included, will understand how difficult it is for some people and will cut you a break.     Congratulations on 16 days

Unfortunately that doesn't mean I am allowed to do uhm, certain things. This afternoon, an old lady kept bumping into me with her shopping cart. I swear, I was about to tell her the ugly truth about.... well, sómething. After that, I bought myself nice new (way too expensive ) wool to make stuff with. I'm trying to bewitch the clock so it goes faster. I showered twice, I nearly drowned my plants and there's litteraly NO dust to be seen for miles around. I can't stand Joel Spitzers voice for a while, Allen Carrs audiobook has suddenly vanished from youtube and I hate myself for complaining. Oh god, I'm loosing it
    Well I see you still have your sense of humor so that's awesome! And if you need something to dust, I have plenty so come on over. It's so dry here in Cali that our dust is actual dirt  Dust one day, it's back the next, grrrrr. So it'll keep you busy for sure lol
    Don't say such things or I'll suddenly find myself in an airplane.. I am not to be trusted right now 
    you made me laugh, life.  Shopping cart as a deadly weapon, no dust anywhere and 'can't stand Joel's voice for a while' Many have felt like you, not that that is much comfort. Still, all you can do is live through it and understand it won't last long. You have a great quit going, your posts are marvelous and will continue to inspire  other quit. Cut yourself some slack and buy more wool !
Saz, it ís a comfort to know many have felt like this. It's easier to believe people who have been there. And venting here might just save my relationship and friendships and family bonds... most of them are non smokers by now, or have never smoked at all. They have no idea what I'm talking about. The other day someone said to me, 'Two weeks already? Ah, that means you're almost there and done'. This person has never even so much as touched a cigarette. She may be even right, but has no clue about the internal proces this costs.. which, by the way, I am very glad I'm undergoing.   In Holland we have a saying, 'Jantje lacht, Jantje huilt'.

@My life, my recovery, my husband thought I should be "over" it at around three months. I told him that I probably would never be over it. Never smokers have no idea what we go through to rid ourselves of this habit. Yes, it gets better with time but we really are just one cigarette away from a pack a day. That's one of the reasons the board was so important to me. Everyone knew what I was going through at any given time and helped put me at ease as I went through the various stages.
    My life (or Johnny laughs/ cries), it's so good to see you share your experiences.  You're going through all the normal symptoms and I'm cheering that you'll get out the other side.       I used to snack so much that I'd literally eat everything in the house and fridge and almost went around the street asking neighbors if they had some snacks I could 'borrow'.      There used to be a funny post in QSMB that I liked to share - it was about all the experiences that we go through on quitting and was quite hilarious.  Wonder if we managed to save that ( @Nancy or @jillar).

@d2e8b8 thanks. Good to know they are normal symptoms, ha. They definitely feel ... unusual . For example, typing this. Looking for words. After each sentence I need to eat something,  like with smoking. But it's not like weighing a ton helps me with my foreign languages. Pfff. I still try to keep it as harmless as possible, but this evening I went from pickles to chocolate to salami to dinner left overs to cheese. Ah well.. tomorrow it's carrots again.           I am curious about that thread, hope @Nancy will find it!!.
@Nancy, I'm pretty sure the name of the thread was quit humor. Unfortunately that's one of the ones the wayback machine says wasn't archived (at least on the one date I found it on  )

Glad another day is almost done        First off, it is good to be like Johnny.     Anyway, I remember what you are talking about when dealing with non-smokers and never-smokers early on in my quit.  Many are very supportive and happy for you...for a few days or weeks.  After a while, they just assume that you are over it and that quitting smoking wasn't that big of a deal.  It doesn't work that way, normally.  As ex-smokers, we have centered our lives around cigarettes for a long time and the healing process with quitting does take time.  It gets much better but there are many ups and downs early on as you try to adjust to living as a non-smoker again.       That's what never-smokers don't understand and that's why I found seeking the support of other quitters on the message boards to be extremely useful in the quitting process.      Keep up the great work, My life.  You are doing great.

So, keep a handful of glitter handy and next time they say anything, throw that shit in the air and walk off. Glitter bomb mike drop  because you are doing awesome!    After everything is dusted and eaten, you find something else to do, and you keep doing that until there's a day you don't think about smoking and you aren't just filling time because you're not smoking...   It just becomes life. Regular life and you wonder how you EVER had time to smoke so many cigarettes!        I used Bob Ross youtube videos and painted 100 ugly sunrises and gave them as gifts for every holiday.  I tried to learn to french braid my own hair for months...still can't! Don't care!      Now you know KTQ, I'll teach you ETQ (embrace the quit) because you have to embrace the process...you do your quit your way, but at the heart of it all is NOPE.
@johnny5 yes, exactly that. I am glad this board is so active. I learn a lot from other people. I try to adopt some strategies and at the same time I hope to discover my own way. It's been a huge help to write my own reply in the SOS board, I found out I can work with that also when it's not crisis time. It has an answer in it about my main theme with nicotine addiction. Learning that other people have gone through this as well ánd 'simply' survived, means the world.      @c9jane29 you deserve a medal for cheering!  From now on, I'll glitter bomb anyone who is cheeky enouh to sabotage me. Whenever you see huge clouds of glitter hoovering above Europe, you know it's me. And yes, please! Tell me more about ETQ (but please, keep Bob Ross to yourself. I won't tell you my birth date. Ever. Making birds out of mistakes.... talking about embracing the quit, that's more like Denying The Quit! ).
Nothing about today is comparable with yesterday, which is a good thing! When I woke up, it took me well over 5 minutes to remember that I quit smoking. Statistically this means I'm gaining 0.343 minutes of forgetting per day.  I'm rediscovering my home, smell-wise. Im becoming more aware of fragrances. Like my laundry shed, the different smells in my kitchen. Oh and I dare say that my sleeping habit is back to normal!!!!! So happy about that, it's never been this quick. It usualy took me at least about a whole month.. but many things are different this time. Still doing this day by day, but able to see it in a broader perspective already. Right now I am hopeful and confident, yihaaa
    Brilliant M !!! I can remember when my nose came alive....I went on a candle frenzy......

All your hard work is starting to pay off....the rewards will keep flying in....I can hear your strenth in your posts...    Good to know you are getting more sleep now...everything is temporary....

1 hour ago, My life, my recovery said:              Nothing about today is comparable with yesterday, which is a good thing! When I woke up, it took me well over 5 minutes to remember that I quit smoking. Statistically this means I'm gaining 0.343 minutes of forgetting per day.          I'm rediscovering my home, smell-wise. Im becoming more aware of fragrances. Like my laundry shed, the different smells in my kitchen. Oh and I dare say that my sleeping habit is back to normal!!!!! So happy about that, it's never been this quick. It usualy took me at least about a whole month.. but many things are different this time. Still doing this day by day, but able to see it in a broader perspective already. Right now I am hopeful and confident, yihaaa                        I'm glad today is better and loving your statistics . It will continue to get better. And really so very pleased about the sleep returning to normal levels, it is important that other newbies hear that any sleepless nights really are temporary.        Keep it going My Life, you are doing great.

I know there will come a day where my junkie thought will be something like this: 'there's no harm in smoking one, you've been off for longer periods of time and therefor your health risk is low'. The sad thing is, I cultivated this thought myself. I used to be so very angry with myself  when I didn't succeed in quitting,  it ruined my self esteem completely. Gradually I came to see that self loathing is devastating, in general actually haha. So I made a deal: I will only quit if I can stay friends with myself when I fail. It became easier and I often said, well, at least I've been off for a while again and been giving my body a good period of healing. I forgave myself rather easy. Now I know, this thought can become tricky for me further in my proces. The junkie could easily hijack this thought I initially created to help myself.  I guess it's a good thing that i'm prepared ..
    There is no such thing as !! Just one !!!....   I ruined many a quit...with this junkie thinking...it's a addiction.... I had a fight on my hands...or feet should I say lol....    My feet...or the nico monster.....  Once I totally understood what was at stake...the fight became easier...and the battles shorter...  Every battle you win M ...no matter how small ....is a battle towards freedom....
    hello m'life    Each and every crave you deny creates a new neural pathway in your brain.   The old connection to nicotine will be dead and a brand new path will be made.  It is beautiful !  Look !        
@Sazerac that's awesome. Just overcame a huge trigger (visiting the garden shop, for me thats like celebrating my birthday so it's a crave bound to something NICE). Imagening I just built a new route in my head is satisfying. 
Sorry I wasn't around when you came on the Quit Train but I have read some of the posts in this thread and you have received some great advice and insight into what this quit journey is all about and how to deal with things. Be sure to just deal with things a day at a time initially so you don't become overwhelmed. It make things easier that way   Reflect often on what you have already managed to deal with successfully because once you have completed the first 4-6 weeks, you have beaten the worst of it. After that, as Johnny mentioned, it's more reprogramming your brain to function normally and happily again without smokes. It does take a long time to readjust your thinking. That doesn't involve craves necessarily but more an adjustment in your thinking. That's the part no one but a quitter really understands. That's also why it's important to stick around here (with other quitters) after the first while. We get it! We speak the same lingo as all other new quitters. It may seem like those of us who have a year or more quits under our belts are different from you but, we're not. We were all where you are now at one time. You can be where we are in time too if you do the work required. It's that simple - just NOPE!
     @reciprocity thanks for taking the time to write. You are right, I got some great advice and support here already. Taking it day by day seems to be working good for me, though sometimes I can't help but be impatient. Right now it helps me to write a lot of my thoughts down, so I can actively change them.. I do hope there will come a day I can live without this board though... seriously. Longing for that time where quitting goes more natural and doesn't require this hard working and constant rewiring. Also, in the past I really put some relationships at stake by quitting, so trying to keep the proces more to myself this time (and ofcourse by sharing here).        Ah well.... day by day

Many leave this board and others stay. Either way is fine but be sure to stay long enough to cement your own quit. As you do this, you will be helping others following in your footsteps, even tough you may not realize it. This is why people here with many years quit yet still remain. If we can say one thing that helps another person to quit or maintain their quit, it is well worth the effort and it helps us to remember the struggle we went through to get to the point we are at as well. Complacency, once the real struggle is over,  has been the ruin of many a long term quit.
Achieved successes in daily, non smoking life.  It's a good start, for sure I will continue to encounter new common triggers for a while. Bring it on!  ♡ waking up -> no smoking!  ♡ driving -> no smoking!    ♡ working -> no smoking!    ♡ riding out dinner aftermath -> no smoking!    ♡ grocery shopping -> no smoking!   ♡ visiting friends -> no smoking!   ♡ lying awake at night -> no smoking!   ♡ doing chores like dishes, cleaning etc. -> no smoking!        Achieved successes, after ...   ♡ feeling sad (few times)   ♡ feeling lonely (few times, but severe)    ♡ being angry (uh... well. A lot. How splendid, quitting nicotine gives me great opportunity to deal with anger, ha!)   ♡ a fight (read the above)  ♡ insecurity (on daily basis)   ♡ emptyness (few times) ♡ a hardcore panic attack (once, severe. Twice mildly. Definitely NOT induced by quitting, 'just' my regulairs).        ^These ^ successes mean I'm starting to deal in new ways with unwanted emotions. Instead of covering them up in a veil of smoke, I let them be. Not always easy, but it's definitely doable. (And: I covered most of the primary emotions already: anger, fear and sadness. Actually, that's something to be grateful for, ha! Thank you, rollercoaster drama sensitive brain, you give me great opportunities to rewire!)      Achieved successes, in relation to nice things! These successes are a bit of a mystery to me, because I've never felt guilty about smoking in these situations. So, not smoking there doesn't necessarily make me proud. Just... neutral or something? All the more reason to emphasize them, they were just as much part of my smoking life and maybe even responsible for a great deal of explaining away and romanticizing smoking.  ♡ shopping at the garden centre, yesterday. How common it is for me to look at all the plants and stuff I bought and have a satisfying smoke. (What? No! I mean, to have a toxic, burning stick, which does horrible things to your physical and mental health) ♡ doing something nice with my man (all sorts of nice. Not to be further discribed). And nót having smokes in advance, during or afterwards!    ♡ long, nice walks  ♡ these absurd long video calls with my good friend where I used to smoke my brains out. Now I'm gnawing on a carrot. Yay!   Edited September 9, 2018 by My life, my recovery

You are doing fabulous Mlmr     And, whether you realize it or not, your posts help us longer term quitters as well. We tend to forget the raw emotions we also felt early on in our quits, or at least they have faded into the background of our mind. Reading posts like yours helps remind us what we also went through and just how precious our hard earned quits are! Thanks for that
Piggys right. I almost forgot already how hard it was. Climbing walls for 5 months and stuff. I won. You shall win too...persevere.
    You're doing awesome, My life.      Successes ... reminds me that I'd want to 'celebrate' one week quit, one month quit etc with ... a smoke.  We have to constantly be on guard as this monster has a habit of trying to sneak in when we start to feel comfortable.       I'm following your journey and cheering you on. 
What a day. Though I understand it's a trick of the addict mind, it's almost like the first few days. Foggy, staring at peoples faces when they tell me something while having no clue what its about. I wonder what my face looks like when I do that. Whenever my mind drifts off to smoking, I start singing or talking out loud about something. Working is a joke today, literally nothing usefull comes out of my hands. I am counting hours, till next wednesday evening, 20:08. That will mark three weeks. Not so sure how to 'embrace' what's going on now. It annoys me, it scares me a bit, I have no muscles ready to attack junkie thinking. I am sure about not smoking, definitely. But I wish I were sure about this state of mind being temporary! It has to be! I would be the first on earth to be dealing with these withdrawl symptoms like forever! Just can't be !! Soon the washing drum will make easy, enjoyable rounds, instead of this wild tumbling program. And then I'll be like clean, white sheets
    MLMR, I think you already ETQ (I can tell from every post you've made that you OWN this quit and are making it a part of your life instead of just waiting for it to happen. You are actively changing your routines and mindset to take on your new life as a non-smoker.) I think today was just a bad day and that's okay because even non-smokers have bad days. I would do the same talk, sing, I would even say out loud "I'm so glad I quit smoking!" (Eat chocolate)    The brain fog does go away! Or we would all be in the corner sucking our thumbs or smoking again!   I know it doesn't help to hear that it gets better while you are in the middle of it, but this is that "fake it til you make it" time frame...even on the bad days remember how much you love your quit and everyday you don't smoke and instead come here; grows those muscles against junkie thinking. Don't wait another week to reward yourself, find something small to do for yourself everyday if you can. Paint your nails, do a charcoal face mask (go out of your comfort zone a little because the non-smoking you might like things now that you didn't as a smoker)    I think you're doing great so please have a treat and good night sleep!!    Also...keep glitter handy for mouthy co-workers!! 
My life, my recovery,       Your post today brought back a flood of memories from when I was at your point in time after I stopped smoking. The memories are as if no time has passed. The emotions were so strong. I also was going through days in a heavy fog and wondering how it was perceived by the people around me. I had told nobody that I stopped smoking for about 5 weeks. I was very surprised to find that nobody had noticed any change in me during that time. While I was definitely obsessed with the emotional changes and felt that I was wandering around in a thick fog, those around me were oblivious to any change in me. I was not concerned that I would smoke, but like you, I was very concerned about how long that state of mind would persist. I can sure understand how scary the thought of forever can be. Unfortunately, I can't offer an answer to those questions. I can only offer an understanding to much of what you are now experiencing. I know that at just under 3 weeks quit I just kept moving forward in very small time increments. Sometimes it was just one deep breath after another, or one distraction after another. You are doing great, and there is nothing unusual about what you are experiencing.
Well how nice is that, apparantly I've been ETQing all a long. ..  but you are right @c9jane29, I am committed to making this work.     During a day like this, I have at least 3 moments where I am so happy about quitting, even if it's just seconds. The other day I read something that said, when you quit, whatever you feel, it's intense. The good stuff also! I totally agree. And these moments hold promises for what it will be like in the future, I trust in that.   I know that I'm dealing with patterns here, not some real time demon or monster. How come it is so tempting to think about it in that way?  The anxiety/depression thing came up frequently today. ('Ah, with my history it must be extra hard. What if I don't succeed?' and  'Be prepared to feel like this for at least a year!'). While the matter of fact is: since quitting I do NOT experience any more anxiety than I usualy do and I have NO sense of that hardcore depression I know all too well. In fact, my brain is more lively  than usual,  I feel connected to people here, I live my life, I do my things, I make no major f*ck-ups. I think about rewarding myself, I wonder about self care, I try to make things as easy and enjoyable as possible for myself. And there's also the occasional fog, the crying, the bitching, the binging and the unrest. Apparantly thats just part of the deal, for now. It's funny, many people here tell me it will pass and then say right away 'although it won't be of any comfort now' but... it really is of comfort!!!  When I tell myself that, it doesn't really have the same magic effect, I guess I need some practice at that. 'This too shall pass'.   @Joe7 that's extraordinary, that the world in your mind was so different from what people around you perceived. Thanks for sharing. Edited July 15 by MLMR
Here is some info about "brain fog":https://www.quittrain.com/topic/10324-the-great-smoke-free-mental-fog/  I told myself that it didn't matter, everything else could wait on me a bit so I could concentrate on quitting.  Your mind and body will heal itself from the damage done to it by smoking.  Unfortunately we smoked for years and healing takes time.  Do your best to keep your attitude up.

    My life, it will pass :).   Physical activity seems to help, walking, running, cycling - whatever works for you.        Stay strong.
Saw this add today, I believe it was in an old thread, think @notsmokinjo posted it. Funny and uplifting! Watched it twice today, when I had mehhh-moments. Thanks! Oh and I thought of something. Today is just as important as any milestone. Because it is what will get me there!        Edited September 11, 2018 by My life, my recovery
    My Life, I love i!

I am going beserk! These thoughts keep coming and coming and coming. I do everything in my power and it's just not enough to feel normal. When will this stop for f'ss?! I am NOT stupid, I try so hard to understand, to debunk, to outsmart and to breath through. Ahhhhh﻿ to hell with it. I will never ever go through this again and to prevent that I am not going to smoke, maybe that's all it has to be about now. I have endless lists and writings. Is it too much maybe?  Am I obsessed? I just dont know and it's driving me insane. They call this hellweek and wether or not I 'believe' in som﻿ething like that, it IS a bloody fight at the moment. What's with this sh*t?! I did not reach this part of quitting to give up once again, right?! Edited September 12, 2018 by My life, my recovery
    Right!
    Ok, who am I kidding. Ofcourse this is part of the deal and also part of the reason I wanted to quit in the first place. No more dependency. It is what it is right now and it will. Not. Stay. That. Way. As. Long. As. I. Don't. Smoke. 
    I think you're in WTF week now my life and you're seeing why it's named that! Everything you're going through is normal. Just keep on plugging along day by day and you will get out of it and feel so much better  
    Yes, don't rush the process because you can't. You need to let it all happen and deal with the craves for the first while then the readjustment of your way of thinking as it relates to smoking. You'll see. Over time smoking just no longer fits into your life and you don't subconsciously think about needing a cig. after you experience some sort of emotion whether that be sadness, joy, boredom or loneliness. Life is so much better after you pay your quitting dues and, you'll never, ever have to go through this again   Just carry on through these early days and come here to rant and rave when you need to.
    The first three weeks are in the pocket!! Still a bit battered from these last few days. But! Incredibly happy I'm here at this point now. I powered through, yeah. Next week's challenge: daily walking, so I will see more of what's in the world, instead of focussing on what's happening inside.     Ahhhhh I AM DOING THIS!!  
    You are doing this and doing it well! That third week for me was the worst of the lot for a reason I don't understand to this day. Congratulations to you, fantastic achievement, keep it going. 
Congrats MLMR!! 3 weeks down! Party time!!
    You don't smoke anymore, M'life !   and each moment, each day will add to your confidence.  Smoking is something you used to do,    Now, you are a free woman.  Congratulations !
    Awesome, My life, Congratulations!      You're doing so well and ... one day you'll be telling someone that these symptoms are all normal.
    Yay my life, congrats  
    Wonderful....your doing great !!!!
Day 22. Read something here the other day about nicotine and dopamine, and, after years of false rewarding,  the proces of learning to be happy again with normal things. Nothing new but somehow it landed. In order to ETQ with a bit more grace and fun, I have to PAR! Meaning: plan, act and reward. So simple that last week when I wallowed a liiiiitle bit in self pity, it seemed just too rediculously straightforward to be a true answer to my very significant and grave problem at that time. 'Yeah, maybe it works for other people but hey, their lives must be so much less complicated than mine, I need some super special, undiscovered and extraordinary solution to get rid of this mental withdrawl circus'.         Well...... whatever. I managed to shrugg off some pretentiousness, borrowed @Sazerac's Big Girl pants (thanks a million!) and planned on walking this morning. Then I acted upon that plan, walked my ass of for one hour and a half, came home and rewarded myself with:   a. Going throuh the cirkel of par (actually, part P and A together = part R already. Einstein would be stunned).    b. Pride    c. Tea  d. Really Dark Chocolate        Thanks so much Wise Old Mentors, for sharing your experiences! It really helps in unmasking various aspects of addiction and in learning to accept that they apply to me as well. I am no exception to the rules... there's some  simplicity and relief in that thought, actually.                       Edited July 15 by MLMR

@c9jane29 :
Your dialogs are so useful to anyone quitting or, wanting to quit . Thank you so much for your insight, M'life.     I think every addict believes their case is special,     that their case is the exception.      Part of our solidarity here is about admitting that we are basically all the same   and all have similar issues that dealing honestly with our addiction exposes.       None of us are special snowflakes.      I will look up some old posts about 'snowflakes',   older quitters blazed that trail for me even when I thought I was a 'special case' too.  My addiction was, of course, more addictive than other peoples.    You can hear how ridiculous that sounds !       I am happy to share my big girl clothing with you.  They are community property after all, and  albeit tattered from some needed tough love,    remain plenty sturdy enough. lol.    Here   are the results of a 'special snowflake' search.

My life, so glad you found your super special solution.  Exercise helped me a lot also.      So great to read your journey.  You're doing really well.   Stay strong.                
Jep.. had two last night. I woke up in the middle of the first one, panicking I had actually been smoking. In the second one I smoked again, thinking: it doesn't matter now anyway, blew my quit already. I felt really, really sad when I woke up, thinking for a while my effort had been pointless. Even when I realised it had been a dream, it lingered for a while and surprise surprise, I craved a cigarette.      One of my fears in this journey is that there will come a moment that I just don't care enough about my health, my life and that I loose connection. After seeing the video, I can translate the sadness to my commitment, the effort I'm putting in quitting, my hope for succeeding. This is what I want!! To be as healthy as possible within my power and to put this stupid cancer stick behind me once and for all. I ám connected to that and it's time to conciously grow some trust. Going to PAR a walk!      P.s. I long for the time when all settles a bit and the need for voicing everything gradually disappears ... there must be life after quitting, right?   Edited July 15 by MLMR

Yes, there's life after quitting and it's so much better when you can live your life being free of the grip of this addiction
    The good thing is as you get into the quit, you start managing to focus on other things for a greater period of time, which then translates into forgetting about smoking for greater periods of time.      The dreams can hit from time to time, I've had a couple of them over the months quit.
    Just a dream tho? Then no problem ML! Just dying memories is all... An educated quit makes all the difference, and I think you're doing great!  Here, let's have some of my birthday pancakes to celebrate!

@reciprocity yes. Looking forward to that! It's a bit like peeling off an onion: removing smoking memories from day to day life. Went to shoppingmall this morning, I used to smoke one while parking, right before entering the shopping croud  (something I uhm dislike, to say the least). Making new memories, new pathways@Sslip true. Distraction is key. I decided distraction has to have a goal in it, otherwise it just feels too pointless. So, I'm learning to eat with chopsticks hahaha! Done it for some time now, but never properly. @c9jane29 ohhhh it's your aniversary!! Sorry I missed it. That's the disadvantage of quitting, my universe has become darn small and inwards... but! I do LOVE pancakes and am gladly joining, they look fantastic  Shall we eat them with chopsticks?

    'Not stopping smoking, look like me you will in the end' 
Conquered new triggers in the past 24 hours     ● Went to a great open air concert. Pushed junkie thinking away, wasnt going to let it ruin the music. It came back a few times, it helped to look at how calm the other non-smokers seemed to be. I want that for myself in the near future and there's only one way to get there: No smoking. I am proud for talking myself through the night!     ● Had a hangover this morning, without the additional dead rat's taste/lack of energy because of chain smoking the entire evening. And did definitely NOT miss the hardship of having to smoke while too hungover to even 'like' it.   ● Went outside for a delicious afternoon recovery coffee. Warm weather, nice and sunny. Smoking people everywhere. This was a tough one, but I did it.       Edited September 17, 2018 by My life, my recovery
    This is splendid news, M'life.  Non smokers ARE calm.  The junkie isn't ruling our lives anymore.   I am so proud of you and you are so right,  hangovers are better smoke free, still can pack a punch but a lot easier than a smokey hangover too.        Soon, people smoking everywhere will just be disgusting and not a temptation AT ALL.    Poor sods.      Sending encouragement for the week ahead and looking forward to your posts. S
Starting to notice a few things, since quitting almost 4 weeks ago      * My agitation of the first two weeks is diminishing! I can still be very snappy sometimes, but it’s easier to regulate.    * The Great Fog is very slowly dissolving. Concentration is better, though still far from what it used to be. I find it hard to focus on something for a longer period of time, whether it’s a conversation, computerwork, a meeting, a movie... but I notice that I don’t have the distraction of wanting to smoke any longer, that constant need to deal with withdrawl symptoms (because that’s what ‘wanting’ to smoke is. So happy to get that now). Taking my time and checking on  H.A.L.T. (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired) helps.    * More and more often I realise I haven’t been thinking of smoking for a while. * Everything feels more intense: the bad stuff, but also definitely the good stuff. Once in a while I have these moments where I feel so satisfied, in the moment, grounded. It’s new to me, but I think I like it a lot and it makes me hopeful for the future.    * Last but not least, healthy skin!
    Wow, My life.  That is so good to hear.     It does get easier, doesn't it?         I remember, I used to want to celebrate these milestones with a ... smoke.  This habit is insidious and wants to strike just when we start to feel a little comfortable.  Stay vigilant.        How's the walking going?        (Btw, good to see you paying it forward in another thread).
@d2e8b8 yes, it does. But I will be careful .. I don't think I left wash drum phase yet. On a day like this I do have my down moments as well, but I try to focus almost exessively on the positives and keep the 'fake it untill you make it' attitude. Reverse brainwashing.      Walking goes well. Did it every day since last wednesday, usualy around 45'.  When I have a hard time I go for a very quick walk around the building (work or at home). With quitting, it's like having two jobs.. Ha. I still spend a lot of time reading and adjusting in day to day life.        About paying it forward, hope I will be able to do that. Don't really feel confident enough in my own quit yet to 'have  a right to speak', so to say... but that will change overtime and then 'llI be more than happy to support others. So important to know you're not alone in this.        Edited September 17, 2018 by My life, my recovery

Just got home from work. It was a foggy day again.. so weird how the days seem completely randomly affected by that.        Current mood:  I want you all to understand dutch so I'm able to rant and write fluently without having to think of words/grammar. I hardly talk to people around me about quitting, I want to spare them and I don't want to be the annoying exsmoker talking about bloody quitting ALL THE TIME. But the truth is, it is on my mind a lot during the day..  people closest to me know about it and they are a support, really. I know that I am not fighting any monster, or battling against myself for that matter. But trying to figure this addiction thing out, understanding what it means, while tumbling in that bl**dy washing drum....pfiewww. It's like trying to make head, heart and hands work together (I'm not sure if that's a saying in english. But whatever, I think it's obvious).   Tomorrow it's four weeks. They went so fast and so slow at the same time. It must be junkie thinking messing with perception.    Edited September 18, 2018 by My life, my recovery
My life, I didn't talk to hardly anyone about my quit offline either. In fact I didn't tell anyone except for my husband and a couple close friends that I had quit until about week 6. After about six months my husband said shouldn't you be over it by now! Him being a never smoker he has no idea that most of us will never "be over it" and that one slip can send us back to a pack a day.  That's why the support of fellow quitters on the forum is/was so important to me. We know what you're going through and are here to lend an ear and any support we can offer Edited September 18, 2018 by jillar

This was my note to self, in the pre-respond SOS topic. I know I am going to need it today. I asked a few people around me if they will support me just that little bit of extra today. This is such a day where, in previous quits, I would 'suddenly' find myself smoking, beating myself up afterwards. Little time and energy today for paying attention to junkie thinking, some things just need to be done. Straight Noping HAS to be one of them.       *So, somehow you feel like you don't care anymore. Maybe it's the depression, anxiety, or just some sh☆tty situation. Let me tell you this: you do care and you definitely give a lot about it. You used to think you didn't care, because it was easier﻿ a﻿nd less vulnerable. Back then, it was your only way to survive. But now things are different, you have changed. Be honest with yourself and listen to the soft voices. They want to be heard. They will help you continue this journey﻿.*Edited September 18, 2018 by My life, my recovery
Hey My Life.... 3 more sleeps and you have been quit for one month... I have a lovely little woohoo thread planned for you so regardless of all the silly thoughts you might get you are the one in control.. you can do this... take the control back one crave at a time.... and if you need to yell and scream in Dutch go for it, if we want to know what it says there is always google translate and that could make for some really funny mistakes.  You've got this my Northern mate.

@notsmokinjo and @Sslip bedankt voor jullie steun. Zulke toffe lui hier hè. Heel waardevol.     Het gaat redelijk. Het is een geruststelling dat ik me vandaag van mezelf alleen hoef vast te houden  aan NOPE. Als ik het eind van de dag maar haal, dan is het goed. 
Hold on tight to your quit My Life! You have worked so hard to get were you are now and you should be proud of that. You are at 4 weeks now and yes, the early quit symptoms are still with you but not for much longer as you are already starting to see improvements in those and having some better days. Remember, quitting is a process and does not happen overnight or suddenly but very slowly. You are making good progress but sometimes it's hard to tell. Stay close to this place too because we all understand exactly what you are going through and the feelings you have as you continue on your quit journey.        Your addiction knows it's in trouble now. You have starved it for 4 weeks! It's getting desperate now and will try to lure you back in weak moments. Don't listen to it! Continue on with your quit. You are winning the war against smoking
    Upwards and onwards  ML.... You've, got that nico monster shaking in his boots !!!  He knows he's in trouble....wow !!..nearly a month....great stuff !!!
    Days like this are why we practice NOPE!! I'm sorry you're having one of those days but, lool at you, asking for help!! Asking for help takes more strength than pulling alone. I'm sending you strength and extra glitter today! ((MLMR))

I expect my junkie thinking to roar for the next nine days. Thing is: I'll be flying Spain-wards. 28°C (82.400°F), blue sky, no complaints.         One thing that stands out for me in this proces: the more I expect and thus prepare for triggers, the steadier I get through. I know the thoughts by now that cause uproar and I am pretty strong in countering them.       I suspect that I already practiced with at least half of the triggers I will come across.. (One of them is wine, ha!). Had tapas last week, my man vapes, lots of people smoke but that's also the case where I work and I've had smokeless drinks in the sun. So, nothing new there. Smoking is not romantic, does not enhance cozy get togethers, does definitely NOT make you more relaxed. And remember, when everything else fails: You DO care. A lot. Just NOPE your'e way through the moment and you'll be absolutely fine. Putting time between me and my last cigarette (forgive me if quoting wrongly, like it like this anyway).        Now I come to think of it... there's truly not that much to be scared of. I sort of already did everything that would wake junkie thinking, except for that it wasn't in Spain. And that I haven't been waiting for planes in the last 4 weeks.     Ok, so.. that's that. Gonna stay as close to the board as possible. And rant and SOS when I need it. And post a funny stickpic now and then.        Bye!             Edited September 20, 2018 by My life, my recovery
    Hey MyLife, I headed on holiday around six or seven weeks after I first quit. It was also the first time I had a drink post quit. The plane journey was a joy in all honesty. The unbelievable panic before check in that led to chain smoking wasn't there. I was much more relaxed as the flight progressed as the intensity of the enforced abstinence wasn't there.         In any case the holiday is a great reward for your success so far. Have a fantastic time. 
    My life, You'll enjoy your trip as a non-smoker.  Have fun and stay strong.
    Hey,  M'life,   You don't smoke anymore !   Have a nice warm time in The Sun !
    Have a great smoke free time in Spain my life, I'm looking forward to hearing how nice it was not to run off the plane to light up! 
    I packed you extra supplies!!       Have fun MLMR!
    It's beautiful here. So nice to walk these steep streets without grasping for air and coughing all the time!        Woke up early this morning,  sat a while outside. It was still pirch dark and quiet. It bugged me that all I could think of was a smoke, while I'm in this beautiful village, on a roof, under the stars ...  all the more reason to go on today and to  solidify my quit.  
    Het kan frustrerend zijn als je die drang krijgt om altijd te roken of er iets over te zeggen. Maar onder de sterren op dat dak in Spanje heb je jezelf iets bijzonders geleerd ... gewoon omdat alles waar je aan denkt het rookt, betekent niet dat je moet roken, en dat deed je niet. Dat is een connectie in je hersenscheid, nooit om je te irriteren om opnieuw te roken. Goed gedaan, geniet van de rest van uw rookvrije vakantie.
    It is beautiful there.  Love the flowers.  Enjoy your holiday and your quit!
    Looks fabulous there  Thoughts of smoking may still come to you but you are also realizing there are so many great benefits to being a non-smoker while on holiday. As those benefits multiply it gives you even more reason to stay quit forever.
    Remember you are a beautiful smoke free woman.
    I hope you are feeling better today!!

Twelve hours away from being smokefree  for 5 weeks  and very proud I got through the past days. Although smoking was not an option, it cost me something! Pfiew. I think I am starting to get some enjoyment back. I was afraid depression was knocking  on the door,  an old but not so friendly acquaintance. But now I think, it was merely the Great Fog playing tricks in an environment where I thought I HAD to feel good and happy etc. That made me afraid et voila... I panicked. So glad I can see that now.        Imagine: a Spanish village, pensionado's (the arty, freaky weirdo type, so friendly and open minded, impressive life stories). But like I said before... they ALL smoke. There's smoke and vape and marihuana surrounding me constantly,  it's absurd really.       Nature here is so beautiful, the Alpujarras in the Sierra Nevada, the old town of Grenada with a beautiful view on the Alhambra, beautiful beaches, sunsets in the mountains and driving offroad because navigation scr*wed up, goats on the road, gorges...        [Scenery right now: I am in bed, typing this. I hear our host and el novio  talking, about addiction to mobile phones, drugs etc. Meanwhile, I see clouds of smoke and vape passing by and I think to myself ... 'ha! You guys... know nothing! I am the real hero here!' ]     Heard this song yesterday while driving through this magnificent landscape. Suddenly had this very strong sense of 'I am doing this!!!' There's no trying, no 'what if...' no, this is it! And it's perfectly ok to do this my own way, because so far it works!!        Starry starry night
    Yes! You are the hero.      By the way love starry starry night. I remember what you mean about the feeling of depression, but the joy we feel when we are free of the addiction seems  purer, not tainted by a nicotine fix. It is just somehow better.        Sounds like a beautiful place. Enjoy it and great work. 
    Sounds to me like you did rise above the challenge.   Great job.  Be proud of yourself!
5 weeks!! Feeling good? Feeling NOPE? It's okay if you feel SNOT too (Smoking is Not an Option Today)...just whatever works     Congrats to you today! Remember your reward!
Yesterday, el novio and I were having a beer in Sevilla after having walked all day. It was hot and I was tired ... but not from smoking and a tight chest!  It is such a difference, I am feeling much better physically. I think I am starting to 'ground' a bit. Sometimes 2 or 3 hours pass, without one single thought of smoking.  I am somewhat more at peace, between the difficult moments. And breathing freely is sooo good! This morning I had a little heart attack though. I was looking for something in my bag pack,  checked a little pocket and grabbed something that felt exactly like a pack of cigs. For one second I freaked out, but then I realised what it was and immediately thought,  'and so what, if it were cigs?'  Yeah
    Congratulations My Life... sounds like your having a great holiday. Its also great that you are finding that KTQ is getting easier.  
    M'life, Everyday is a brand new day and you don't smoke.    It is great to see you accumulating your strength.  s
Having a little halleluja moment here!  Came home from Spain, glad to be back. I started unpacking,  doing laundry, groceries, cat cuddling and then suddenly I realised I didn't think of smoking at all and above that, I was very straightforward in eh, dealing with what should be done after vacation! Usually it takes me at least an hour to land so to speak and to get started. What a great feeling Edited September 30, 2018 by My life, my recovery

    Awesome, My Life.  You're doing so great.   You faced the challenges, shared your experience here and are a few successful weeks into your quit.        Great to see your journey.  Stay strong.     
    Bliss has come to a temporarily end...  bleghh. Apparantly someone hit my car last night, thank god they left a note and number. Quite some damage. Didn't manage to get rid of the mood all day during work and I had serveral thoughts of smoking. Ofcourse I did not act on them, but a nagging voice followed me through the whole day. I have this basic junkie thinking of 'I need to consume/smoke/whatever'. Or, 'Something is not right and there has to be done something about it'. And that being said, I really DON'T WANT TO SMOKE, I just really don't!! It's more about not being able to deal with what is. And at the same time I am dealing with what is, but it has to be better, stronger, more productive, less whining, just do it etc.      A BIG FAT BLEGHHHHH!     
    Sorry about your car my life  Just try to focus on the positives. They left a note, that's HUGE! You didn't smoke, that's even more HUGE! Your car will be fixed just as well as your body is being fixed by quitting. 
    I know you are right @jillar. No casualties, they left a note, good insurance system. And it will be fixed. And there are many many many things worse than this. And all these words don't change sh*t about the junkie thinking right now. Gotta buckle up, grrrrrrrrr.  
    Two hours later and calmth has somewhat returned. Took a cold-warm-cold-warm shower and made tea. And searched for weird crochet projects to start (among inspiration: https://croshame.com).       I hear people talk about this Nicodemon a lot. Thought, maybe the little fella would like to be personified,  since so many people speak of him as a real thing (note: definitely don't want to do this myself. I am a firm believer of outsmarting addiction instead of 'batteling some non-existent being').      Anyway. Now I am googling images of demons and cigarettes, in order to start a new design.      I think this one is cute:    

    'Let me be clear. Smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer. Everyone knows that fact. Does everyone know the number two cause of lung cancer? Is it common knowledge that lung cancer among never smokers kills more Americans than AIDS, drunk driving, drownings or home fires? Even though many lifestyle factors contribute to other diseases, what kind of person would ask an AIDS patient “Are you gay?” At best, that would be insensitive. Then why do people think it is acceptable to ask lung cancer patients about their smoking history?'    https://lungcancer.net/living/stigma-kills/         
    Good post ML...
    You're right about the association most everyone make between lung cancer and smoking. Smoking is a major factor in a large number of diseases you never want to get but still people link it with lung cancer. Maybe because that link has been popularized by the media over many years and it's a scary concept people can visualize and understand. If you told someone that long term smoking could lead to Buerger's Disease, they would probably look at you with a puzzled look on their face. That's as real a possibility as lung cancer from smoking but many people just aren't aware.

Yesterday I went for a beer with a good friend. This friend had quit smoking for just over 8 months. Suddenly she leaves the pub, only to return three minutes later with a pack of cigarettes. I stared at her and continued my conversation. Like a boss. Edited October 6, 2018 by MLMR
    Well done !!!!..... You saw smoking for what it is ..a horrible killer addiction...sorry your friend three away a great quit...
    Awesome MLMR!   There comes a time when it's just NOPE and that's it. My mom and sister smoke around me all the time. My sister STILL offers me a "drag". NOPE (and for the record, sister, smoking IS a drag.)
    Almost high on oxygen this morning, biked for two hours and my lungs were having a party! I also notice my heart isn't ticking like a madman during exercise and the amount of extra energy is amazing.         'You look less stressed than usual, I can see it in your face', someone said to me the other day. Uhh, say again...?! I like that!!         Regarding moodswings, I decided it is what it is for now. I think my worries about them are actually of heavier weight than the blues itself.                
    Sounds like you had a much deserved good day MLMR. Love your positive attitude 
    Your story is so encouraging, M'life, and it is a real joy to see you develop your strengths.  You have great power and will learn every day how to use it.
7 weeks in! And boy,  how I not miss to...  * put on my jacket and smell hints of smoke     * hear myself squeeking during the night,  annoyed but mostly worried   * check for smoking gear whenever I go somewhere else   * have this internal debate whether or not to go for a smoke when I'm with nonsmokers   * be silently worried about my health, ALL THE TIME * judge myself for smoking, at least 27 out of 28 times a day (the day starter was the exception). I don't miss that one by the way, honestly. But had you told me that 6 weeks ago... would not have bought that from you! Edited October 9, 2018 by MLMR
    At seven weeks you have lived smoke free through a slew of craves and triggers and succeeded at every turn. You are building yourself a very fine quit, indeed.
    You are doing exceptionally well MLMR. I'm proud of the commitment you have given to this and the support you give to all those following by detailing the journey. You may be surprised, but it keeps getting better as you progress. Keep up the good work. 
    You're doing awesome, Supergirl ML!     Great to see your positive posts.  I can so relate to the smell of smoke on jackets and the little squeaking at night.  Isn't it nice to be able to go biking and feel good about the workout the lungs get?        Stay strong!
You are doing great, MLMR!  Thanks for sharing your experiences with us and keep up the awesome work!Edited October 10, 2018 by johnny5
Whoa ...    Right now I couldnt be more happy about the work i've done in the early stages, in identifying triggers and understanding their impact.         Started with the SAD lamp this morning,  third year in a row. Made myself a nice coffee and had some papers ready, to prepare for today. So I am sitting behind this absurdly bright light and suddenly this intense crave hits me... omg!!! In a flash I see myself lighting up, immediately having that 'Ahhhhh'moment, so at first I'm all 'wtf is this, where does this come from, oh nooo'. Panick in the disco, 'Will this ever st....'       And then it dawns on me. The lamp is HEAVILY connected with morning smoking rituals. Waking up, coffee, lamp, one or two cigarettes (the only ones during all seasons I allowed myself to smoke IN the house,  as to ease and boost myself for REALLY doing this lamp thing, waddajamean fvcking up my reward system), and I kidd you not, the crave eases out the second I understand  the connection. Knowing this intens 'wanting' is nothing more than a brainfart, a result of programming. Knowing that here and now, in this moment, I cut yet another tie with this darned addiction!       Have a good day!  Edited October 10, 2018 by MLMR
    You are doing great MLMR 
*Sigh*. Work to do. Is this a crave or just fearing a crave and thereby inducing it?        My alarmclock wakes me up and I know, light therapy time. BAMMM, almost húngry for a cigarette. Immediately. Though I haven't had morning craves in at least 4 weeks, apart from the strong one that I had yesterday. Doesn't make sense. So could it be that the intense crave I had yesterday, regarding that lamp, somehow linguered and showed up this morning again? Just because I am not totally there yet, in this particular situation?        Actually, I think I know. This was not a crave. This probably was a thought right after waking up (or I could have been dreaming about craves/fears/lamps, whatever!), the thought may have frightened me and voila, thinking/fearing mess with me and I experience something like a craving. Hmmmmmm.      The good thing is, by now I have analysed this thing to death, so it's lost all its allure.         Over-thinkers anonymous: 'Then, 18 years ago, I had a moment of clarity. Ever since, I've been working the program, hoping for another one'. Edited October 11, 2018 by MLMR
    MLMR there is a thread somewhere about how nearly became phobic of the sewing machine... because I associated it with some bad craves from the first week of my quit... and up there in your last post you just laid it bare... it was more the anticipation of a crave and having to deal with it than an actual crave... it was the nicotine using fear to try and sway us. Tiring work all that over analysis but it makes us who we are... you my dear are so rocking this quit... congratulations for making the connections between triggers and snipping those ties. This thread of yours is going to save someones life one day, if it hasn't already... what a brilliant read and guide for someone coming behind you or for someone who needs that final push that they too can be free.
    Seriously, today was one of the best days in weeks, quit-wise. Only had a few mild thoughts about it and immediately and easily replaced them.          So, what's new since I quit?        * I have an infinite amount of extra time. At first I was awkward with that, because what to do and where to go.. ? But by now, in the morning I use the extra minutes to snooze longer, take more time (and with that, ease) for groceries, my kisses last longer and i spent many, many, MANY minutes online reading stuff about chopsticks.  * My constant and ever present stress is gone!! Where-to-how-to-not-too-long-I-want-but-can't-I'm-broke-it's-bad-I-need-need-need-need-need-it-now.     * at work, I use the extra time to prep whatever it is I have to do. Whether it's seeing a client or attending a meeting, I take four to five minutes to breath and be ok with whatever is presenting itself.   * I suddenly have money! Nicely piling up, waiting to be spend on a piano.      I am nearing the two-months mark. And I am proud!    
    Love this !!!!!......

Context: work.  Sitting in my car. Thinking about today. Am I satisfied? Not at all. Was it worth my time? Nope. Did we come to some mutual understanding, something fundamental, something that makes us  a serious party to take in account?  I seriously doubt that. Contemplating everything that has been said during the meeting. It is not ok. This is not how we planned it. And I saw it coming and shared my worries long ago, for nothing.       And then suddenly I have this anger coming up, al the way from my toes crawling up, it’s hot, it’s swirling. I am mad as hell. And it’s crystal clear rage. Not blinded, not tempered, my heart beating like crazy but for a very genuine reason and I just let it beat like that. My hands are glued to my steeringwheel, I’m surprised the thing doesn’t melt in my hot hands.    I’ve not felt such anger in ages. In the background the radio is having a party with Ravel and his Bolero, reaching a climax.  I seriously did not have a part in that. Pure coincidence.   Not once does smoking cross my mind. Somehow I’m able to experience this rage in all it’s rawness, it’s beauty even.        And when the final notes die away, my heart is beating slower, I loosen my grip. My breathing is back to normal, maybe even a bit deeper than normal. Let's go home and may tomorrow take care of it.   Man, do I like quitting and feeling everything that I’m supposed to feel right now.  Edited October 18, 2018 by MLMR
    Wow!  Do you understand what happened.  Perhaps, as smokers, we get used to managing our emotions by smoking and now the emotions really have a chance to express themselves?   In any case, you're doing really well.  Stay Strong, ML.

Ofcourse I knew it was about nicotine and giving myself a false sense of consolation, ease.  But I never thought of the fact that smoking in these particular situations, while being sad, angry, bored, etc. is a repetetive way of telling myself that it's not ok to feel the way I do.       I am actually a bit bewildered now
Nothing to do on a saturday evening. Friends doing things without me, Mr. Man is having Stick's Night. Cat is having a ball with a fake mouse and the dishes are done. There's a cake in the oven but I have to be patient a little longer. God. Bourgeois.         Dead silence.       I could go for a walk. Maybe do some closet organizing?  Hmm.   Haven't seen my neighbours in ages, I might check if theyr'e still alive. Now I come to think of it, why arent they checking on me? Ok, forget it.  I don't like them anyway.       I think of all the boring moments in the past. Smoking seemed the right thing to do. Strange, how it often kept me from ... well, doing things. Was I really bored and smoking? Or did smoking make me believe not caring much for other things was ok...and did I maybe even create boredom  to justify smoking?       It's amazing to rediscover myself as a pretty pro-active person. I want to get things done, not much 'sit-there-wait-and-see' left. It started out during the first weeks as distraction, keeping my mind off smoking. But now, unplanned,  it's gradually becoming the new normal somehow and I really really like that!  No more 'oh let's smoke one first'!      ('Beautiful. Ok. Done? Good. Now let's have a sm...'). <-- nothing wrong there. Fart of the brain. No need to get uptight and all. This is the plan: tea and cake, evening walk, ring the neighbours bell and run away real quick, shower, sleep. Edited October 20, 2018 by MLMR

    It was great learning the new me after quitting smoking.    Taking breaks, sitting on my back stoop and breathing in deep delicious breaths of oxygen.  Oxygen became my new drug.      Learning how to be still.  Learning how to reward myself.   Learning to experience reality without the veil of smoke.   Learning how to be bored....which mostly leads to a creative outlet or beautiful sleep or marvelous day dreams.     You will love your new you, M'life.

So ... since eating cigarettes isn't exactly the right thing to celebrate a 2month quit with, I'll be once again having a hard look at some things. I challenged myself to think of at least 3 new found improvements.  Here goes.  1. No more butts everywhere at my Villa Balconya. Just clean concrete. Very cozy.  <- read that one somewhere, by the way. Haven't been to Balconya like forever, so how would I know. I just assume. Unless my unkind neighbours emptied their ashtray on my tiny outside space.   2...uhm...  3...ehhhh...    (Junkie thinking: *screw improvements. You know you miss me*. No. I don't miss you and for the record, 'you' don't even exist. 'You' are just pattern in my brain that I'm about to destroy for good.  What does exist is my body, my health,  my family, my surroundings and especially my ... *oh, just quit your righteous do-good talk. Who cares anyway, who are you kidding!* Ok brain pattern, you know what? Drop dead! The fact that I have 2 months under my belt and I would like to light an entire pack, does not jeopardize my quit as long as I don't light up. Early night, goodbye world! Tomorrow it's  us again.)    Aaaaaarghhh! NOPE!!! Nope nope nope nope noperdenope!!   Edited October 22, 2018 by MLMR

    It gets weaker and weaker the longer you just keep saying NOPE!  
    Your two month celebration may have reminded your addict that times have changed, you don't smoke.  Glad you powered through, M'life.  Awfully glad, I am.
I'll tell you a secret; my junkie brain tried a few times last week to get me to buy weed. I sat around for almost a whole day wondering who I knew that I could call. It went as far as trying to figure out if I could get to Colorado(where it's legal) and back while the kids were in school.  or could my mom pick them up? I haven't smoked weed in a good 10 years and bringing any back would be a felony...junkie brain at it's best. It caught me by suprise; I'm glad that I'm secure enough that I could laugh at myself during it, but a 10year old memory totally halted my life.    It reminds me to never drop my guard, always stay vigilant.     Resolve forged in fire can not be broken!       Sending strength of mind and heart your way
Thanks for sharing that @c9jane29. I want to introduce you to Weedie! I created him a few years ago, as an ode to this  anxiety relieving Plant (well, that's what it did for me at least)          Nowadays smoking him is just a memory. But I can relate to what you said really well.. like you said, junkie brain at it's best.        Resolve forged in fire. I like that image.   @jillar awfully simple but yes. Keep noping and itll be alright. And @SazeracI  am also glad. I have a little trouble with digesting the annoying construct of NOT wanting to smoke and still having these thoughts. Ahhhh hear me talking. Thats the junkie. Classic. It is what it is. Accept it for now.        And so it goes...    Edited October 22, 2018 by MLMR

Oh gawd. Shaking about what just happened. Was going to buy some breakfast before work, at a place I usualy try to avoid. Its where I grew up. Poured coffee in the supermarket, got what I needed and payed. Once outside a giant melancholy came over me. Saw the crappy station where I hung out as a teen (rollin' / smoking cigs), and the sad grey buildings. I swear it was like someone opened a bottle of memories and emptied it on me. Im not sure whether it was a smell or simply being at that place that  activated this but the result is  here I am, typing this on my phone in the car sobbing about god knows what kind of child memory stuff. And I really need to go to work now and get my act together.      The joys of quitting ...         Edited October 25, 2018 by MLMR
Oh gee I'm handing out the kanga cuddles today .... here is a pick me up hug from me to you...          I totally understand what you are saying. A lot of stuff from my childhood and past that I thought I had dealt with emotionally has re-surfaced during my quit... I think the smoking suppressed a lot of emotions over the years. I have also noticed many of us go through a catharsis when we quit, we learn to love and believe in ourselves again and part of that awakening involves dealing with the buried things, especially from childhood. Look at our dear friend @Linda Thomas and the evolution she has made, who would even recognise her as the woman from her first posts. Quitting is empowering, but the transition has some bumps and curves you need to face before moving on. But like everything quit related there are good days and there are tough days. So as my dear Grandma would say... "You have 5 minutes, cry it out until your all snotty, then wipe your eyes, blow your nose and pull your socks up. You have school now, its a responsibility, after school you need to cry some more you have all night."..... so tidy up that make up chooky, blow your nose and take 3 big, huge breaths (cos you can do that now you don't smoke). But don't forget about it or ignore it, just shelve it until after work.    So it must have been the day for crying jags in the car... I drove to town I grew up in (Yes I know its more than local like I am allowed but I needed to for an appointment and I just wasn't going to make them all today if I didn't cheat)... anyway since we sold my Grandma's house I have never been back, but today I did and the new owners have changed it so much... it was awful... sure the house looked cute and cottagy but it wasn't my Grandma's house anymore... massively, structurally different.... sat there and bawled my eyes out... then had to drive past my parents old house, the one my Great Great Grandad built and it was all changed and horrible too and I felt saddnes but not like my Grandmas. So I get you, it a horrible feeling when those repressed feelings fly up and hit us. But its good too, it strengthen's our quit and it strengthens us and it lets us grow into the people we were meant to be.

There is nothing good there.     Crying is healthy, it gets things out before the emotions bottle explodes.  Cry happy tears that you are taking back control, happy tears that you are strong, beautiful woman that never stops learning and growing (and I'm not talking waist lines here).    This is the beauty of not smoking things away! You get to be full on in these emotions and really savor them and learn to be okay with them.    You have shown all of us your determination so tell junkie brain to take a vacation cuz MLMR has better things to do than mourn the death of...death.   Bob Ross, baby...I'm telling you...this guy is on to something
    Oh... off topic here but had to tell you Weedy is going straight to the QT Art Gallery... I will invite you with a shout out to his grand opening.
@notsmokinjo ahhhwwww, that kanga! Think you can send  me one as a playmate for my kitty? Or would that be illegal? It was so strange, I really was 14, 15 again for a brief moment.  I saw myself acting all tough girl, anti-everything, 'I don't need anyone!'. But I did need someone and I wasn't tough, back then. It helped to write it down, it certainly got me drying my tears, take a deep breath and move along. I like what your dear  Grandma said to you and I took her advise and shelved it for after work.    So, anyway,  @c9jane29 the fashion you describe is indeed to cry over!      I wore my aunts 70's pants and dyed my hair henna red, for over ten years. Heavy black eyeshade, oh how cool and untouchable I was!     I promiss you I won't dwell. Got some happy crying to do, you are right!

OK teen fashion for me... depended on my mood but basically one of 3 looks... jeans and a surf brand t-shirt with blunny boots.... jeans an band t-shirt under an open flannelette t-shirt with the thick black eyeliner etc and either black dessert boot rollers or docs... or some remnant from the hippy era to go with my hair in two plaits past my waist (until I chopped it boy short cos I had a fight with my dad and that's what you do) and a selection of crazy home made crochet hats and whatever shoes I felt like.... no wait I rocked a 4th look... jeans, white t-shirt, blazer.... I would just pick the look to match my mood... I too hate photos from my teen years... and there are very few.
Memories come up in real life, apart from smoking or not smoking.   Many memories were masked with smoke and may be more accessible and vivid now   but, you know how to look at them, accept them and release them if they are not useful to you.  Crying is a lubricant to letting them go, washing them away.    Our eyes need watering, they need tears to grow.        I was the 'super hip all grown up child chick' hanging out with pimps and whores, musicians and drug dealers, thugs and mugs.   Of course I had a smoke dangling from my lips or behind my ear.  In such a hurry to grow up, it is a miracle I survived.    The outfits were v. cool though.  Micro minis and Courreges' go-go boots or granny dresses  and sandals or Levi 501's, chukka boots and a see through top.

Why did you quit smoking?● less anxiety● to become more comfortable and ok with who I am• physical healthHow long did you smoke?Started at 14, quit around 28, started again three years later. After that, I entered a relapse cycle. Horrible. Smoked for a total of +/- 18 years.How long have you been smoke-free?65 daysHow long do you think it should take to be free of nicotine addiction?About a year working to be "safe", concious maintenance for the rest of my life.If you go back to smoking, will you want to quit again?YESHow long will it be before you do? Weeks...months...years? When illness strikes?I honestly have no idea. Will quitting be any easier next time around?I don't know. How do you think smoking will benefit you?Not at all.Is it worth giving up what you've worked so hard to do?No.
    I know you need some time to work on your chopstick skills...   Looking good!!  Hugs for you!!

@jillar that'd be great. He cut back on vaping already, at least when I'm around.. but it's (unfortunately ) up to him to make the decision. He is very proud that I quit again (yesterday he kept saying how happy he was about my improved breathing, he said he notices I'm more 'peaceful' in a certain way, becoming less agitated and much more aware in the moment).         Let's hope the Stick will have his own awakening some day and give up on that grown man's dummy

    Yesterday I changed my ever present sneakers for heels.  I don't know how to properly walk them, never did so. But how hard can it be, compared to quitting?        (oh and, seriously, this is huge. Sneakers = safe. Heels = scary, grown up and challenging when you have  funny walk like me). Rockin' it anyway!

70 days completed.  It seems like 'occasional, unexpected triggers' hit hard these days and worse of all, it's like they trigger 'checked ones' as well.

Top notch junkie thinking: I want a smoke, after I had a mild fever and been coughing for a week. I know. Just a pattern. Top notch junkie thinking: I want a smoke, when the day before yesterday the first real sad rainy cold set in. I know, just my brain. Top notch junkie thinking: I want a smoke, because don't you think you just deserve it and maybe that can help with shutting you up about everything you feel and writing about it all the time and concidering you and your bloody quit so darn important?

We are all addicts, after all.          Wel, I'm glad you love it, cause I honestly friggin hate it at the moment.  I have to put it out in the open or I'll cave. I still need it to control my quit.  But I have this CONSTANT voice: attention seeker, loser. I know where this voice comes from.. and it's not a nice place. I hope quitting will eventually bring me a bit more at peace with myself. Ive seen parts of that already.      Bring it on, I'll get there.
You sharing all the crazy you feel at the moment is a gift you are leaving for those travelling the quit road behind you. I promise you there are lurkers out there reading your every post and there are those who will read your words and take a deep breath and think yep, I can do this too and can take back my life and and my recovery and grow. You are someones or many someones shining example.     Many have said this, its in threads all over the train but MLMR this is all about your quit... especially in the early days... it needs to be, until you come out of the fog of dependency and re-learn how to experience and feel life it has to be all about you and your quit... its not about being narcissistic or self indulged it is about learning about being a smoke free you... its about learning and enforcing that mornings are about breathing deeply of the smoke free air... its about enjoying a drink without a nicotine chaser... now how many mornings have you started the day with a smoke? and how many (72?) have you started without... it takes time... around the 3 month mark lots of us get frustrated with the time it seems to be taking, and the fact that the same things seem to rear their heads again and again... the thing is if you have done something a few thousand times, every day in a row and you haven't for 70 days in a row which receptors are going to be in the majority.... it works though, just give it time... I used to be have my first smoke before I even went to the loo in the morning.. now I don't even think about having one... it takes time... but it comes.       OK.. so the changes in you as a person and how you see yourself... that comes too and you are right it has started all ready for you... a lot of things from my childhood (which was, bumpy) I thought had been dealt with resurfaced when I quit and a lot of my behaviour became obvious that it was because of things that happened as a kid... and there was a time when I hated my quit because all these 'flaws' were being thrown in my face and I had to deal with them, because I couldn't have a smoke and hide... but I feel stronger, and free-er and I love that quitting smokes is letting me be the person I was meant to be... and that will come for you too.... so basically what I am saying is everything really is all about your quit and you.... and you need to invest the time and energy into it, even when it is at the annoying stages because the rewards, oh the rewards to everything from how you look, to your health, to how you feel are worth every moment you doubt it and have to fight and fake it until you make it .... so this is one of those horrible stages... like the terrible twos... but your quit is strong, you are strong, and write it all, for you, for us and for those coming behind because it is a real gift you are giving to everyone.
A big thankyou @notsmokinjo.    For reminding me to acknowledge and value the steps I take. And having a little faith in time.      I woke up this morning and thought, ok, another night has passed. The day ahead of me will not be longer than any other day. Trying to be at peace with what it's like right now, cause fighting and judging my state of mind obviously has the opposite effect. There is a big chance this wont last as long as sh*tty stinky butt thoughts want to make me believe. @c9jane29 thanks to you I have this image of a gross stinkin' glitter covered ass, whenever I reach that stage where humor is thankgodfully taking over again.

I barely know you and I know that's not true!!

        Just gonna be here...cheering you on...even if you don't want it right now, I want you to know you are not alone 
@c9jane29  thanks. Plundering the willpower stash these days. X
    You can do it MLMR, heck you ARE doing it! Stand proud and believe in yourself. You have an awesome toolbox and great support so lean on us whenever you need to             
Thank you @jillar . I am really looking forward to 22/11, that will mark 3 months.   It's just pushing through now. Bleghh. Just got to do it. Got some things going on, keep telling myself that Im better off not smoking and these things would have happened anyway.
    Yep MLMR, that's what we all have to tell ourselves. But each time we push through we get stronger  You are doing great and are right where you should be in terms of quitting. I had a pretty difficult first year so if I can do it anyone can  
Day 74,8. Sailed pretty rough for the last 4 days. I would love to say something wise, smart about it. But tadaaa, haven't got any of those words for you! I had a few immense 'wanting moments', didn't do it and am not particularly proud or happy. I am romanticizing smoking like crazy for the last few days. 'Pfewww, smoking would be a relief when we are fighting like this'. Having thoughts about smoking in regard to have at least one 'little' thing for myself. Somehow it doesnt pay off to take time to debunk thoughts. I want them thoughts gone and I want it now.. grmbl.         So I decided to faire Ignore Way.  Not trying to outsmart addiction, wearing myself out by this ever learning and thinking smart sh*t. Ok thoughts, you are here. Whatever. I don't smoke.          (omg. Will this ever end)                Edited November 5, 2018 by MLMRIncluded an appropriate funny picture
Yes MLMR, they WILL end, we just have to go through it for them TO end. You're doing great and right where you should be in your quit. You're nearing three months and nicotine is fighting hard to win you back so just trust the process. It will get soooooo much better One thing I did each month was look back on my posts from the start, this helped show me that although it didn't always feel like it, I was progressing and winning the battle Edited November 5, 2018 by jillar
It's a beautiful "yay" face, friend     Sometimes we just have to fake it til we make it...maybe it's the "curse of the 3s" (3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months) blues and hopefully clears up soon.     Until then, keep working on finding that reward or that one thing that's just for you. I know it's hard...trust me.     I've told you before but I'll say it again...even if you're grumpy, I'm still glad you're here
You're trekking through No Man's Land now MLMR. You've fought through the horrible early days and established your quit and amassed tools to help you fight the weaker cravings that continue to arrive at your doorstep day to day but the newness of the quit has worn off so now it's just daily plodding along now - no fanfare like there may have been in the early days. You're not far enough along yet for your mind to be comfortable with your daily routine (without smokes). This alone is unsettling. Just as in the early days, progress seems stalled. You can't see any day to day so you think it's stopped? NO! It's still happening and now you will be tested to see not how strong you are to fight those strong and frequent early carvings but to see now what your endurance is. The challenges won't be as pronounced or as frequent as the early days but they will still come and it's your job now to deal with them one at a time, The principal is still the same as early on. The longer you keep putting one foot in front of the other day by day, the sooner you will feel the weight of this change lift from you and you will begin to really appreciate just what you have done for yourself. You have almost 1/4 year invested and that's something to be really proud of and also excited about. Now it's even more important than ever that you stick close to your friends and supporters on this board because we know exactly what you are going through. We have been there ourselves - we get it! Reflect on all you've done and continue to build on that amazing foundation
Day 80. It's like I am in a vacuum. Too far in to give up, too early on to have strong faith that I'll get through the few tough things life is throwing at me right now.   'For sure people don't want to listen to you any more, go fix these thoughts yourself! You started this, now do what they say and cut the crap! Go walk! Go do some NLP-ish thing to get rid of the voices! And keep up your spirit for the newbies, wouldnt want to discourage them, huh?'         I am scared that I'll snap one of these days. I have not been this scared to fail, not since I started. There now, it's out.
hello M'life.   Please understand that you are only responsible to yourself and your quit.  Your effect on others and their quits is not your job   and it is not something you have any control over.  All you can do is be true to yourself and hold on to your commitment to yourself and your quit.     Your posts are important.  They express what you and many others, who have difficulty communicating,  are feeling and experiencing. Every post is an important post.  I am not tired of listening to you.  I can't be...I am watching a chrysalis turn into a butterfly.        Day 80 !  Hang in there, bebe.  You quit smoking.  Reward yourself.  Nurture your sweet self.

The thoughts I try to keep at the forefront of everything are:  I have never actually quit smoking, until now.  That first month was very difficult - why would I want to go through that again - ever. I really disliked the person that smoked and was so ashamed.    Plain and simple - just do not go there.  That option is not even on the table.     You and I are going to do this.  Keep posting - it helps me immensely because I know I am not alone
MLMR I echo Sazerac. Don't worry about discouraging newbies. You are being honest about how your quit is and that is something that is useful to anyone else having as hard a time. I had a really hard quit too and can totally relate. Your posts help others who can relate so they don't feel alone either. Congratulations on 80 days, that really is a great quit you have
    You won't love quitting all of the time.  (Later on you will.)  But you gave yourself the addiction to nicotine and now you are the one that's putting an end to it.  You are fixing a problem that has been going on for a long time.  You are taking positive steps forward.  This is a good thing!
    MLMR        It's okay to voice the struggle.  I think most newbies know this is not a walk in the park.  That's what makes emerging from the struggle all the more consequential - the fact that it wasn't easy.    The important thing to know is that eventually you will emerge from the tough times - stronger, healthier and wealthier.  You're doing great.

        You GO  Girl
Today... I had the best day quit-wise in ... uhm, 2 weeks? Yes!!    This morning I left my appartment and I smelled the crispiest clearest rainy fall leaves wet earth smell EVER. And I was so happy about making it through the stormy head weather!      Hardly thought about smoking. Though rainy season brings back smoking  memories, it also re-introduces my reasons and well, I kinda lost touch with them. Imagine picking up half wet jacket, foul cigarette smell hanging around it. Imagine a constant shower falling out of the sky and needing thag cig and having trouble keeping it dry and noticing it doesnt even taste that good, going back up to the office, carrying that disgusting smell with you. Not being able to enjoy a good coffee or tea without a cigaret. The constant needyness.        Despite at least 10 really  sh*tty days, I am so glad I am still here. Because what's also happening is this: I eat slower and with more attention. I drive my car less hasty, I have more patience. I sleep REALLY well. I am calmer in general, even though still dealing with my regular moodswings and panicks.     I don't know what the proces has in further store for me... but right now I am content with the way non-smoke life is.
    Awww, your first glance at what lies ahead MLMR, that's great! I'm so glad that today was good for you. This is why we go through those nasty first few weeks, to get to the other side  You are doing Fantastic!  
    More great days ahead for you ! You are shiny and new.  Beautiful.

Day 85! Less than a week away from completing three months. Things have calmed down a bit, since somewhere between last saturday and sunday. Brain is still doing it's best to lure me into to smoking, but I'm back at where I was in my second month: able to detach from the thoughts and going strong in counter-thinking. Repeating over and over and training myself in that really does the trick and though it's annoying sometimes, I'm sure I'll benefit from it now and later on.        It fascinates me. The time distortion, change of perspective (sometimes in the blink of an eye), having a sense of real power over the addiction versus 'I'm a victim and will this ever end' (yes, at times my brain thinks like that. I'm ashamed about it but it is what it is and I find comfort in the fact that I muster up the courage not to identify with that thought. Because that's where I would really have a problem and definitely would end up smoking one after another again).       I remember somewhere in the beginning, I thought about balance, between surrendering to the proces (aka trust) while still deciding where to go next. Probably still working for me.        So, I think I'm safe to say I had my fair share of three-month-hardship and thank god it didn't last the entire month. And now I have yet another major milestone within reach, ha!      Edited November 16, 2018 by MLMR

So thoughtful of you. And I whish it was a 4mo monthiversari, but got to do 3 first     Ridiculous junkie thinking has been shouting at me today. Shouting back didn't work out, took walks and everything. Ah well. It's one of these 'world, please f yourself'-days, I had them back then and I sometimes have them now. At least I'm glad the stinky component is out of todays picture.        But hey, there's bear  coffee from Texas!!
    I thought the voice of my addict surely gained VOLUME   while laying low on frequency as the first year quit rolled around.     While the whine didn't even tempt me after a while  it was still an interruption that demanded attention.   This infuriated me at times.        All I can tell you is that the addict's voice becomes v. quiet and infrequent after time.   You won't be thinking about smoking/not smoking forever.  I promise.    Ride it out.    These are just receptors in your brain getting re-fitted.  You are claiming back your brain.

Often I can handle it by thinking AND acting on Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. Sometimes walks do the trick, etc. Riding it out, like you said. Yesterday I had a date with my sisters, had been four years ago for the three of us to go out for dinner. I took the train, something  I did for years but haven't done now in some time. Brain went insane! And it looks like I took these moments there with me into the next day somehow, cause I had a hard time shutting them up today. I figure i dealt with multiple triggers (sisters, train, going out, memories and some tears) and brain thinks that shouting junkie thoughts is a great way or coping. Anyway.. glad when there's another day done, to be short          1 hour ago, c9jane29 said:   whoops!!

07:23 AM. Woke up after an old fashion panicky night, to the point where deep breathing epically failed. Pacing the house,  heart beating like crazy. Not feeling like myself, but one big piece of fear. I always know it will go away eventually but in that moment it's impossible to hold on to that knowledge.         It's been a while since I had on of these, I think 5 or six weeks ago. Quitting does actually work well in reducing panick attacks. I dare say it now... oh yes, it's true. I used to have many more,  but untill now I didn't quite realise it because for the last three months most of my thoughts were about the unrest,  the battle against junkie thinking.       It's unsetteling to have had one again, makes me wonder what I did wrong. But thats just as automatic as junkie thinking: the inner blame game, I associate fear with guilt. Maybe this is the right time to counterthink these thoughts as well and start focussing on new associations.       Ah well... first got a day to live through.
    Hope you're doing well now.  Your journey has been amazing to follow and I'm sure will inspire other quitters.
I hope that by writing this down the urge calms. Smokey thoughts are strong again. I try to reward myself each evening, but thats even more diffcult than not smoking. My world is upside down, things happening so fast now. Got to remind myself that I have a say in some of it. And the things happening to people around me are not my job to fix. Got to be with me.      Some people even told me, ah just have a smoke. It's not ok for you to still crave!! What shitty advise is that.        Looking forward to sunnier months and to that self confidence everyone is talking about.    -edit- tckr just told me Im  2%over half of first half! I guess that's worth a yay Edited November 25, 2018 by MLMR
ML....  Sorry your having to deal with some of life curve balls just now... Rewards can be very small...nice smelling shower gel....nice bath bomb and soak...new hairbrush...it doesn't matter as long as it's a great for you.... Non smokers have some crappy times too...   You have a fabulous 3 months quit....what would be gained by smoking now ....nothing .....you would still have all the problems ,Plus you would be so disappointed ...  Don't listen to the folks telling you to smoke ...that is so negative ....keep coming here....post as much as you want ...SOS if need be......stay strong ...
    Thanks @Doreensfree, The thing is, I don't actually crave smoking. Im put off by the thought of a smoke between my lips, by the smell, by the taste. And when I think further ... the slavery, the shame etc etc etc. Just nope nope, smoking is a big fat nope.        Still. Finding a new way to deal with things, which at the moment aren't really everyday-things... (not comfortable putting it up here for everyone to read). It's really about learning to deal with sh*t in a non-toxic way. Non-toxic being...healthy, or something?  Rewarding, taking GOOD showers, spoiling myself with .... things! Ahhh it's so not what I'm used to. In the first month of my quit I owned that part..     I think I just GOT to do it. When I feel like it, when I don't feel like it or when I'm about to smash something real hard. Got to get that dopamine production to work.                 
    I am way behind you so have nothing to offer in the way of quit advice.         A good few years ago I felt a bit like you have lately. It wasn't because I quit smoking, it was because my marriage ended.         I made a complete tit of myself trying to get him back but nothing worked. Then I was left with the reality that my whole life had changed and everything was different.        It took me about six months to feel I could actually start living my new life. It was a different life but it soon became the norm.         What I'm trying to say is no matter how much you try and find a solution to change how you feel it isn't always there. Time really is sometimes the only healer and you can drive yourself nuts trying to speed up the process.         I read this thread every time you post on it and it's such a positive influence for all of us following in your footsteps.      Sending you lots of positive vibes to get through

Take a step back and think of what you are achieving.....you are amazing...you are doing what every smoker on the planet ...deep down want,s to achieve ..  I too have received some news lately will will change my life comp!etely...how will I deal with this ?.....Day By Day...and do the best I can...    That's all of any of us can do...don't be hard on yourself ....xx
    As I look back on my smoking days, big life hits of shock, unhappiness and difficult changes were always dealt with chain smoking events and hiding in my puff of smoke never changed one thing.  It actually always made me feel lousier.   Now that I am a nonsmoker, I think I finally experience true emotion when difficult things happen.  I cry, I lean on the ones I love and have surrounded myself with authentic, true friendship.  I believe my quit friends can guide me through anything.  We are here for you MLMR and Doreen.  Life is always going to be full of crappy things.  Smoking does not have to be one of them!
Sorry you're having a tough time MLMR and I'm so glad you didn't listen to those that said go ahead and have a smoke. Don't know if the person who said that was a smoker or not but I do know that smokers hate losing a 'partner in crime' and nonsmokers have no idea the grab this addiction has on us. But we know and will be here for you to help get you through the rough spots.   There is a light at the end of the tunnel MLMR so just keep putting one foot in front of the other P.S. @Doreensfree, we're here for you too...... Edited November 26, 2018 by jillar
    ML, Life will happen with our without smokes.  So glad you're staying strong and dealing with everything without giving in.  
    Well, must be 'tis the season'  I, too, have some life changing issues to suddenly deal with.   Times that I would have smothered in a shroud of smoke. I thought....yep, these are the times I would have an endless smoke dangling from my lips...    but, these are new times,   it is a new day.    I am no longer a slave and refuse to enslave myself ever again.     I am glad M'life you are working on your rewards.   These are so important  and reminds me to reward myself as well,    we all need some extra dopamine especially in this dark time of the year.    
    * Craving is not an emergency.  * I can do this because I am a grown woman with skills. Even during dissociation and reliving the trauma, I am still that same grown woman.     * I am capable of doing what's best for me. * Smoking does in no way enhance this situation. It won't make my friend have less of a fight in hospital and it won't make me steadier. It most definitely will not heal relationship wounds.  * This is temporary. This will pass.    * There is no quick fix in this. Breath, that's all I have to do.   * If events will take certain turns, they would have anyway.         
    Great words, ML.  Hope things work out for you and your friend but you've got it right ... events will take whatever turn they need to.  You can do this, ML, you're a strong woman.     
    Keep writing MLMR, and then re-read it as needed. It's all so true and I too hope your friend pulls through. You're doing great 
    We all wish we had some magic words to offer you MLMR that would pull you through your life struggles at this time but that's of course not possible. What we can do is encourage you and stand with you during these times. Admiration from all go your way because we do understand just how much more challenging it is to continue building your quit while other life challenges sap your emotion strength.        Good on you for keeping your quit intact!

    It gets better and better incrementally,    you will only notice in hindsight at first  then the good days will be running fast.    Not to say, real life won't bring conflict or worry or....well....LIFE  but, it won't be associated with smoking or not smoking.
    Having a luck dragon ... also magic words :).    It does get better.  I'm kind of still amazed that after all those years of smoking, I can now run.  Rather than being out of breath, I worry about injuries and such ... that's pretty awesome to me and something I cherish every day.    I'm sure you have your own something that amazes you because of not smoking.
    I'm amazed at the freedom I feel every day to do what ever I want to do without having to service my addiction every half hour or so.   I feel good about myself for a change!
    Thinking of you and imagining your face in splendid sunlight.
So ha, I figured something out last week. I remember this was an issue before somewhere in my journal, but I guess certain topics need more than just one click.    Early on in my quit I dealt with many addict moments: coffee, driving, phonecalls etc. etc. etc. At one point I thought I had that under control. Untill I found out that whenever the going got tough, these seemingly conquered moments where challenges again.  Be it less than before, but still. Apparantly they are not just moments in time, they are all linked and flaring up whenever shit hits the fan. Smoking gave me the impression of a foundation. While, in reality, it constantly, day in day out, kept me unstable. Always looking for moments to get that dopamine fix. What that tells me is that, besides the simple fact that Im a wired nicotine addict, I have a certain need for predictability. Whenever things in life are difficult, I want to be able to fall back on something. I want to build in certainties, rythm, kindness.  These past 7 days I did that by talking to myself in the mirror: How I did well (at night) or how proud I was for heading up for another day. No matter how corny it felt, I did it. Rythm, of doing what I promised myself.   And now I realise Im almost halfway month four already. Which will be 1/3 of a year. Yeah!!          Edited December 4, 2018 by MLMR
    Nice post ML....    Who better to talk to you...than yourself....   We all believed the Lies as addicts......and have had to retrain our brains... And unravel the lies.... Well done ....  Your climbing that rope to Freedom !!!
    I'm guessing that you are already starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel getting brighter and brighter and you will start to see more and more points when you feel just "normal" again - not struggling to be something you're not comfortable being (if that makes any sense to you ). It happens to everyone at some point during that first year when we truly see that a permanent quit IS possible for us and that we can not only live with it but we welcome it! 
@reciprocity true and yes that makes sense.. it's like everything in my head is reorganizing. It' so good to know I have the power NOT to smoke, with everything thats happening right now. If you told me that in the beginning, would have laughed at ya! Telling myself that with every moment I overcome, I break another tie. And then once in a while I have this overwhelming sense of calmth and steadyness... wow. And each non-smoking day I contribute to generating more of that! Edited December 4, 2018 by MLMR
    ML...has asked me to move this thread to Off The Record.....x
@MLMR, I have the feeling this thread is helping a lot of people with your honest posts about how its going. I think many a lurker was benefitting by reading it in the introduction forum. I love watching your journey and seeing your inner strength build with each new day  
@jillar it felt too open. Been dealing a lot with panick attacks lately, more than pre-quitting. Negative thoughts about myself are a huge deal of these phases and I suspect writing about quitting triggers it, partly. Old demons are forcing themselves upon me, I'm really having a tough time. I'll make it without smokes, but wow. Ugly things in my head and Im not so sure if thats for the whole world to read... but not writing is not yet an option.      So thats why I asked Doreen to move this thread, at least for now.
    Totally understandable @MLMR, I hope you feel better soon  
5th night in a row with poor sleep. The past days have been whirlwinds, so many thoughts. Suddenly the crave's back: darn receptors scream for their candy. Why now, suddenly?  Yet, conciously thinking about smoking makes me want to vomit. What then is it? Probably the huge inconvenience of being by myself and the spooky images I create when I'm not paying close attention.      First weekend alone. Well not entirely, will be helping a friend painting in her new home. It's like with quitting.... debunking thoughts.... did that past week... but now I'm kinda done with that and just want proper sleep and no more uncanny-stomach-achish background noise.        I do care. I do care and just to be sure, I DO CARE.
    Aww sorry your not getting much sleep M.... That nico monster is still tapping your shoulder and whispering ...Hey Remember Me !!!!!!   Take it steady ...still one minute at a time ...I know you won't smoke ...he will eventually give up ....you are stronger than him...   Painting will be a great way of keeping busy ...tell that mister to ...Go Do One !!!!!
    MLMR, those craves seem to really rear their heads when we are low, struggling with other feelings and exhausted.  Distraction is the best.  Painting will give you a feeling of accomplishment and hopefully a sense of tired from the work.  I know a virtual hug just does not cut it like the real thing.  I so wished I lived closer that we could help each other through the tough times.  Just keep pampering yourself, you so deserve that right now.  
    Sorry you're going through all this right now MLMR, and as long as you do care then your quit is safe! Keep caring, keep busy, it will get better, I promise....
    G’day   Can you live on a promise?  I promise it does get better.... So Much Better.    Youll get to a point where you’ll have a bad nights sleep and never even think about the smokes.    Trust me that is freedom and you’ll get to that place that you deserve to be!   Chris

Don’t forget you have just pulled off “a death defining act”. GoodOnYa!
I know you are right. My energy is being drained by dealing with breakup,  since last weekend. Not only did I lose my man, I also  have to discard an image of what our future would have been like. Every crave I thought id dealt with in the past 5 months, is back. Am not sure how, only know that I HAVE to get through without lighting up.      I do have a choice and I make it time and time again.  You are right @Cbdave
G’day   A relationship break up?    Yep you’ve got double trouble cause giving up the smokes is giving away a relationship in a way.    There comes a time in any breakup when you’ve got to get a bit of old fashioned HATE going! You owe yourself, none of this civilized sh1t.  Time to hate.   Youve been wronged. You deserve better. Its time to move ahead, cause you need to grow and these remains of a relationship are just a hinderence ...... Chris
"It'll give you a sense of relief!"No. It will give me a sense of dizzyness, sickness and it will taste like fresh diarrea butt.  Smoking will trap me and sooner or later, probably at the very first puff, I will regret it with all my heart.        "Smoke a cigaret and you will be more like your old self!"Yeah, like my old anxious self that is. I quit for a very special reason remember?        "Smoking fits your mood."Smoking has nothing to do with moods whatsoever. I smoked because i am addicted. Now that I am breaking free of that for almost 6 months, I really need to see that smoking does not lift mood or spirit. I have plenty of other (great!) options to do something about my mood. Even when it gets me by the throat. Same principles.          "What does it matter anyway?"It matters, as in cancer. As in all sorts of life-decreasing illnesses. As in slowly suffocating myself. It matters as in life or death, really.       "You will feel less alone."If I light up now, Ill be probably more alone with my stinkcig then I ever was in the past 6 months without.       Junkie thinking, please get your ass out of here.  You don't serve me well.        Edited February 16 by MLMR

If I light up now, Ill be probably more alone with my stinkcig then I ever was in the past 6 months without.                     Junkie thinking, please get your ass out of here.  You don't serve me well.            MLMR, that definitely says it all.  What a great way to work through the craves.  Writing down the questions and answering them.  I think you have answered them for all of us.  You read these and wonder how we can even let that thought of smoking creep in.
    You needn't let any junkie thoughts take a hold of you. You needn't listen to any complete sentences,   squish them mid phrase and replace them with your true thoughts and reward yourself for every junkie thought squelched. What you are doing is re-claiming your brain, one receptor at a time.       I yelled, 'FREE YOUR HEAD' mid phrase and drowned them out as quick as I could. 
    I agree with Linda MLMR, this thread is going to, and probably already has, helped a lot of people. 
    Absolutely..... This post has been honest ....and I'm certain it has helped more folks than you think ...   I don't know how many times I yelled ..Smoking is not on the table ..!!!!!.....
    You could actually copy and paste this post to the "Pre Respond to Your Own SOS" thread because all the statements are true and reading them makes you stop and consider reality vs junkie thinking sweet-talk.
3 O'clock midnight. Too many things to worry about and too little sleep. Junkie thinking keeps interfering. Its absurd and it drives me mad. How can 'I really got this now, I had a definite click moment!' be so close to 'ahh,  well... what would it matter...'.        Not even the slightest doubt about lighting up. No room for discussion. And yet, that annoying prick of junkie thinking over and over again. 'Oh you thought you had coffee, driving, meals covered, for more than 5 months now? Not anymore, since breakup! Go have fun figuring it out all over a-fvucking-gain!' 'You reduced panick and even felt better afterwards? HA-HA! Life sheds a different light now, so enjoy adjusting!'      So, listen up, ogre of a shit addiction. I wont buy cigarettes. I wont smoke. I stand my ground. 'This too shall pass' and all the cliché postcard texts together!!!!! I have come this far and I promis myself again: Not One Puff Ever. Aaaaaarrrrrrggggghhhh!!Edited February 22 by MLMR
    Keep telling the monster to Fvck  Off...    He will get the message M...one day he will give up trying ....
    Sometimes, the ferocity of a crave is mind blowing  especially in the first year when your brain finds yet another connection to nicotine.  Do not be discouraged.  One by one, each and every brain receptor will be re-claimed.   This is why rewards are essential.
    Yes it's surprisingly tough at times throughout that first year and this far along there can be huge WTF moments because you believe you are further along  and shouldn't be feeling tested so strongly again. Thing is, they are just moments now and not upon you constantly as they were in the beginning. Proof you're winning! Stay strong - stay committed and you'll be fine. Remember, it's a process. A rather long one at times.
    I'm glad you have this thread to vent on MLMR, writing the words down always seems to make the feelings less powerful. Why let a breakup come between you and your awesome quit? Keep going girl and just remember that everything happens for a reason. Your special someone is out there

Note to self: stay sharp. Know what this is about.      "When I saw his casket being lowered into the ground, I lost every single ounce of desire for a cigarette. I quit cold turkey without any cravings or thoughts of cigarettes anymore. I did not have withdrawal symptoms, or if I did, I didn't notice them because my heart was broken and grieving desperately for my only brother who laid six feet under ground.        Cigarettes can and will kill you. Sometimes you die slowly, sometimes you die quickly, it all depends on what disease you get from smoking. It took a heart wrenching horrific tragedy to open my eyes. Don't wait until it's too late, quit smoking today and embrace life to the fullest without lethal cigarettes in your system. You can do it."     https://whyquit.com/whyquit/Memorial.html   
Smokey memories. Went away with sis yesterday, to get my very first diving lesson ever (birthday present, so cool).     Have not spent together-time with her other dan dinner or drinks, for the last 6 months. So there it was: right when she picked me up for the 2,5 hr drive, I was thinking about our first smoke stop. That thought kinda stayed with me all day and whenever it presented itself again, I told myself how I was using this day to pave at least one new brain pathway.     About the diving itself.... uhm ... well, let's just say challenging. But after the initial ohmygodiamcrazyfordoingthis I picked myself up and did it anyway.   I didn't see no fishy at all, though the tank was crowded with it. I was way too busy belly breathing and adjusting the air in my uhm whats it called, vest? Conclusion: swimming and diving are two totally different sports and I'll stick to the first.      And when we left the place, people smoking everywhere. The smell, disgusting! The gap between mental ' wanting'  and the physical attraction of smoking is growing. To me it looks sad and lonely on people, even when they smoke together. I see a junky getting his fix, nothing more to it. But obviously memories still need to be dissected, one by one.       And how I long for the day even thát part is over!           Edited March 2 by MLMR
Love the positivity in this post @MLMR.....its great when the light bulb goes on !!!!!! I started driving late ..O.M G...it took me 18 months and 4 tests....to finally pass....I blamed the driving inspector every time ...lol....    Never could dive either....so ..your not alone....well done sweetheart....

The pic below is on a cruise ship. The area circled in Red is "Smokers Corner". The only place on the ship where a person can smoke. A little hard to see because it's a dark corner hidden away from everything else where the sun never shines. I used to frequent this place when I smoked. Now I walk by and feel only pity for those faces I see huddled under the deck there - always the same people, getting their fix while the fun part of life goes on in the sunshine all around them. Aside from pity I feel a little embarrassed that that was me under there in the past. Never again!
    That big black cloud of shame ...I know it well ...it's a great feeling to be finally be free of it ....
Great update @MLMR, it's so great to watch you growing in your freedom from this addiction. And kudos to you for trying diving, I'm too chicken to try lol.@reciprocity your smokers corner pic reminds me of the dark room thread. Hopefully someday they too will see the light Edited March 3 by jillar

Thoughts of smoking are pretty common at 6 or 7 months quit but they are just that ..... thoughts. Those have no power unless you act on them and I know you won't. Frequency, length and intensity of those thoughts will continue to diminish over time. Yes, it takes awhile but it will continue to get better gradually so just carry on and you'll be fine.   I too an sorry Jane has disappeared. She did a lot to help new quitters but, sometimes, people just decide to move on. She may resurface one day. Life if full of surprises.

Every day of that time you reinforced your commitment to be a smoker. Smoking was part of everything, especially anxiety and stressful moments. Now it's time to reverse all that thinking so is it any wonder that it takes quite awhile? It won't take nearly as long as the time you smoked but it doesn't happen over night. My own thoughts about smoking have continued to diminish well after my 1 year quit mark.         These distorted thoughts and memories of smoking are the only cards your addiction has left in it's deck because you've already shown your dedication in fighting it since August 22nd of 2018.  Continue to heal by using the logic and truths about smoking that you have acquired since then when smoking thoughts come calling. That is the tool that will erase those thoughts for good eventually. Outsmarting your addiction is the right path.
    Soon it will fall away like a snowflake, you'll hardly notice when it's over.  Please remember to tell us when it happens, it's coming soon.
Horror and more horror. Great way to start a monday morning, ahum. Counting down to 7 months. Only 11 days to go.       "We would have many more lung cancers than we do if smokers could live long enough to get them. When many people with fatal heart attacks or strokes are autopsied, there are often precancerous lesions found that indicate that if these people had a few more years to live they would have eventually succumbed to these smoking induced diseases."     "Each day thousands upon thousands of children become lifetime slaves to nicotine and their youthful error in judgment will cost at least one-third of them their life. Yes, there are habits associated with nicotine addiction but they result from our addiction forcing each of us to select regular feeding times."
SHIT. It happened, quitting became my religion.     Bumped into a collegue. Started talking about month 5 and 6, the grief cycle and Keeping The Quit. With my 'listen to me, this shit is SO important' face.  She drifted off and I fell silent. 'You know what, nevermind'. And we parted.       I need a smokeless antidote! A good portion of carelessness. Wanting my 'f... that' attitude back.               Edited March 12 by MLMR
    So take the bull by the horns and go do something that would have been completely foreign and unexpected for you in your former "smokers life".     I did that when going through a significant life change many years ago. Go shake things up cuz no one else is gonna do it for ya  It will make you feel alive again!     
    Spring is coming and your quit is gaining momentum.

    'Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong' - Johann Hari      About rediscovering purpose, connection and all that. 

I think I miss smoking, because i am addicted. Its not because the weather is so nice, or because I miss a person. Its not because of anxiety, or smoking being some magic cure. Its because i am adicted to nicotine and therefor have all these associations and so I tend to believe my thoughts. I dont have to believe them. I can choose not to.      This is that particulair point in time, I have been here before. I can do this. Its 221 days now. Wouldnt want to throw that away, would I?         Smoking is not comforting, soothing, easing, whatever. Smoking is giving in to addiction and slowly killing myself. Wouldnt want that, would I?

Just woke up, had a smokey dream. One after another, not bothered at all.       It took me over 15 minutes after waking up to ditch the thought of failure and to realise it was just a dream! Only just gradually coming back again... ahhh, I didnt. It was only a dream and I am just as smokefree as I was yesterday or will be tomorrow! Working towards 8 months!
I think it was about 8 months in when I had my one and only smoking dream...woke up in a panic but realized within a few minutes (or maybe it was only seconds?) that it was a dream! I was so happy about that! God knows I did not want to ever have to start my quit over again.....keep it going, @MLMR, you are doing great!  Edited April 9 by Rozukilink
Just drove home after a long day at work.   The radio played this:  Ive loved that piece like forever.      Felt a rush of all things good: no more smoking misère, proud, relieved, thankfull and chuckling over the drama of the first 3, 4 months. How i never ever want ro re-do that.      As long as i can remember ive been short of breath . Combination of smoking and anxiety. For the first time ever i am starting to experience calm breathing. I eat more conciously.  I have fewer speeding tickets. I arive in time for work instead of rushing and still being late. Might sound dull,  but its actually what ive been longing for,  for so long .         Yeah. I am happy with quitting
    I'm glad you're seeing so many awesome benefits of quitting MLMR, thanks for sharing 
Sadly, my mom learned today that she's got a kidney tumor. It was discovered by accident,  because she was preparing for surgery and had a ctscan because of that. The positive news is that its only 4,5 cm, she will be called within 6 weeks to have it removed. Only then will they be able to tell about possible metastases.      Not one second did I concider smoking, though I am a bit in shock by this unexpected news. I guess its another opportunity to genuinely feel what there is to feel, instead of hiding behind a veil of smoke.
    Exactly MLMR - hiding behind that veil of smoke is what we all did, telling ourselves it helped us calm down and deal with life - ha, what a lie! We were hiding from life. It's good to just deal with things up front now isn't it?   I''m sorry to hear of your mother's issue. A good friend of mine was diagnosed with the same issue about a two years ago and he is now fit as a fiddle, Had one kidney removed and the other treated with chemo for a bit and is cancer free now so take heart and let's hope for the best in your Mom's case  
    Sorry to hear your Mum is going to have to through this ....but     Wow !!!!....I'm so proud of you .....high five....for not making this a reason to lose your fab quit ....
    MLMR, prayers for your mom.  She is so lucky to have you by her side.  You are becoming stronger every day.  You will get through this.
@reciprocity, it certainly is good to deal with life upfront. Better for me, better for her. And... glad I dont have to leave the room to light up. That would embarras me, but I'd still do it. Everything for that fix... Her surgery and therefor that ctscan were initially planned in october, so technically that thing has been discovered 6 months early.  Thats sheer luck. I have my hopes up for her story to end as well as your friend's.   @Doreensfree, thanks.  It may sound inappropriate, dont mean it like that, but I am really thankfull  to experience the result of my perseverance so far. It would be so, so shitty to have to battle urges right now, while I actually want to be there for my mom.    @Linda Thomas
    I am so sorry MLMR.     Mums are so precious and I hope for nothing but a positive outcome for yours.       Just look how far you have come. You faced and won challenge after challenge. Right now you're facing an enormous challenge and you're still smoke free.        You're pretty amazing really x
    Sorry to read this MLMR, so glad she got her ctscan now instead of waiting until October. Someone is looking over her  And good job realizing smoking would have done nothing but make you feel miserable! 
@Lilly, my relationship with my mom has never been the most momdaughterlovish .. thats what makes this even more difficult.  We have our challenges, to put it nicely. She's been through cancer before, many memories. Hopefully this wont be anywhere near that.   @jillar exactly. She got a call today, she's scheduled for the 29th of may to have it removed. Quicker than we initially thought,  nice!Edited May 3 by MLMR

    Surprised by a strong cigarette-hot sunny day- pattern thought. Hush!       So, note to self:   Imagine the hot days where you were too short of breath to actually feel good. Remember the summer nights were you smoked so much while cursing yourself for throwing away all that money and for deliberately f*cking up your breathing. Think back at all those cigarettes you hated smoking but had too anyway. And how about dull stale  cigarette stench that always seemed to rise from the couch/car/jackets in the hall as soon as the weather grew hotter?     Yeah, exactly. Bye pattern, you dont fool me at nine months!

Had the strangest week. First of, the surgery went fine and my mother is doing ok. Waiting for further results to come in next tursday. They, the doctors and nurses, are fast and professional and they have taken good care of her so far.    Smoking played a huge role in many of my thoughts and memories, for 4 or 5 days. I suspect the hospital visits triggered something old. At some point I even 'longed' for smoking, or so I thought... dismissing these thoughts didnt always do the trick. Working through them partly solved it. And then, last friday during a super bad mood, I had one of these moments where things just click and make sense (again). 'Better just accept it for what it is'. Sounds so simple and cliché, but honestly, it was bliss to realise once again that fighting whatever is presenting itself will not do the trick and will, in fact, make matters worse. I can have a thousand thoughts about smoking, but I wont light up. Thoughts are just that: thoughts. Because, in the end not lighting up is ALL that matters.    Last night I dreamt I smoked. As soon as I woke up, I knew it was just a dream and I am as smokefree as yesterday. Though it is a bit weird to have had such an addiction-dominated week... I am once again very grateful for not giving in. And for being this far in my quit proces.
    You are doing great MLMR, that old nicodemon sure puts up a fight though huh?! Glad you're mom's surgery went well  
    So glad your mom is doing well.  She is so lucky to have you by her side.  I am sure it is tough watching her go through that.  It is those difficult times that bring back the smoking memories.   MLMR, we are so much smarter and stronger.  You will keep that quit going.
Blowing steam off.      Had a sucky week. Some things happened at work and I dont know how to act on them. Some family matters on top of that et voila ...      This month is harder than the 9th. I keep having these thoughts and memories, where my brain goes like, ah screw it. Ofcourse, I wont. But it pisses me off to be at this point and have these stupid brainfarts. I just want to be done with it.       I dont want to miss my clean lungs.  I dont want to light one after another and feel guilty all the time. I dont want to die while riding my bike or hiking, because of oxygen lack.        It will be better again. I will make it past this stage, just as I did before. This is what it is for now, but change is on the way.

@Linda Thomas sorry to hear about your sucky week too. Yeah, its pretty weird how our brains work, right?       And about work, you couldnt be more right. Its strange, in some ways I am so much stronger since quitting but at the same time, i feel like I have to set my boundaries earlier than I used to. Or, maybe Ive been consistantly crossing them in the smokey past and this is where they actually are...? Anywayz,  today is a day where I keep reminding myself about the guaranteed positive outcome of quitting.      My mom is doing ok. Tumor removed, all clear. Thank goodness for that!       
Sorry about your sucky week you two, but glad you have this place to vent to and keep your awesome quits  I hope this week is better for you both, xoxoEdited June 17 by jillar
    Im in my car right now, about to go to work. The thoughts of smoking are so present, for days now. I keep telling myself to be proud of where I am but it just dont click. Its absurd how vivid the thoughts are. Got to push through now, it would be insanely sad to loose my quit. But why does it seem so... attractive?! Cant even remember to have felt this 'need' before... so far ive always been able to downgrade it too chemical processes, and this time i cant get passed, 'I dont care anymore, ive proven myself, just be done with doing your best, it would feel sooo good....        I am ashamed and yet this is it for now. I really do hope to pull myself out of this self-loathing misery and be proud again soon.

    MLMR, I know I'm probably sounding like a broken record but those feelings you're having are completely normal. That's the purpose of the one year commitment. Especially as we near the first year mark. I felt the same as you, I did it! I can smoke a cigarette as my reward. Stupid huh?!  Just know that you're completely normal and that this too shall pass..... I promise, xoxo
Thanks @Linda Thomas. I realised today that I actually felt sorry for myself, for quitting and watching some (formerly quit!!!) collegues smoke... bleghh, the exact feeling ive been trying to kick in the butt for the past 10 months, with succes. And now suddenly I cant find the words, the ways to beat that emotion. Im romancing smoking and I know it, ohhhh my god    I have one big word in my mind and thats NOPE. No. Matter. What.    I really, really try not to fall for 'Its been 10 months already, why now and why with such intensity?'. Theres no proper answer to that anyway...

I felt so good, had cravings once in a while but, away with them! And i felt pride and so many good effects of quitting.... aghhhh
I will write a letter to myself again. I did that at some point where I had a real tough time, stuck the letter to my fridge back then. I think its time for a new one, fitting this phase. I need to ditch that sorry-feeling,  it doesnt suit me well, i cant use it. I am in my 11th month ffs. No way that I will lose this quit. And I also want to carry this part with dignity, as sucky as it is.Edited June 25 by MLMR

And i felt pride and so many good effects of quitting.... aghhhh              You'll feel good again MLMR, I promise. We have to remember that we smoked wayyyyy longer than we've been quit and these bad days WILL still come, even after your one year. The beauty of it now that you are this far along is that you know that you can get past the craves because you have for months and months now Distraction, distraction, distraction. I used to take a drive in my car to get a crave to go away because I didn't smoke in my car. Do stuff that you're used to doing that you never smoked doing. That worked really good for me
    This is just the dying embers of your addiction.    Do not take this to heart, it is just another neural pathway being diverted to the high road, the clean road.   Take stock and remember that you do not smoke.  Those days are long gone.  You are a new woman. Also, check yourself with with Red Flags.       I promise you, you will feel better.    S

Don't feel anything for those smokers except pity .....if you asked each one of them ...they would love to be were you are ,and have a fabulous 10 month quit ...   The only way you will win ...is keep on fighting ...one day ...your battle will be won ...keep trucking ......x

    Part of me felt shame for writing down the way I felt, but I am actually very glad I did. Thanks so much for you all popping in here, your answers, be it about holding on or offering the matter-of-fact-approach.  I dont have the words at this moment, but it means a lot to me.        Its a relief to be able again to see it as the neural proces it is. Im trying to figure out my HALT, and there's a few things to pay attention to. They have  NOTHING to do with smoking, and they need an approach of their own.       THANKS!              
It seems like the worst is over, finally. What a strange an unexpected phase. Once again, I feel stronger in my quit now that I 'got out'.      Sometimes I miss the big revelations I would have in the beginning, they gave me such power and confidence. It takes some effort to rely on what I learned back then and to stop disappointment from growing too strong sometimes.      But its comforting to look at everything I gained, not to convince myself of quitting, but simply to realise where I am compared to 10,5 months ago...      I eat differently, pay more attention to what and when I eat, I do chores in the house during the week instead of pushing myself raging through the house in the weekend and therefor my home feels much more like my own safe place, I sit when Im tired and when I cant, I just slow down a bit, I handle anxiety with compassion. Thát is probably the biggest gain... I am able to be with overwhelming emotions without beating myself up about it. That is huge and I should be celebrating it and embrace it with all the love I have in me, because how often did I not tell myself that Im not good enough? Repeatedly, year in year out? Ive probably set something in motion that will bring together all the stuff I learned in different therapies and treatments.     Uhm. That is something to be darn grateful about.    Edited July 6 by MLMR
    I'm happy the worst is over for you. Its also good that you focus on what you've gained from your quit. I suppose a reminder to oneself about why one quit smoking in the first place and looking at the gains, prevents one from becoming complacent and relapsing (just my opinion).
    That's right Ankush - never forget why you quit. That reason, whatever it might be, was powerful enough to move you to take on the biggest challenge of your life so ....... never forget what brought you to this point. It will continue to motivate you through the entire process.

    MLMR, so glad the struggle is finally over.  You are finally there and realize life as a nonsmoker.  It truly has no place in our lives and our lives are so much better without it.  
    I love hearing about the lagniappe of benefits people experience.   Quitting smoking really is life changing and your documentation have been a beacon to many.  
@MLMR, I'm really glad to read your last post and see how well you're doing now. I don't know if you know just how much this thread of yours can help others who think they can't quit because of their depression or anxiety. You are proof that they can Maybe, you can think about moving this thread back to the main board for others who are on the fence about quitting?

    of course, do everything you need to do to protect yourself and protect your quit.  I understand you don't want these epistles on front street, I am just grateful they are here because they are so very valuable. I flipped my wig when they were first moved, thinking they were gone.    
I. Am. Just. Soooo. Done. With. The. Thoughts. And. Memories. And. Everything. Related. To. Smoking.        Why, in the name of everything thats devine,  does it take this long? And WHY is this last quarter of my first year so terribly challenging?     Edited July 10 by MLMR
    Patience.   and dogged determination.   Free your head. Don't give smoky thoughts any energy.   They will fade.
@MLMR, the whole first year was really tough for me too. Please keep reminding yourself that you smoked for wayyyyy more years than you've been quit so it makes sense that this addiction isn't going to die as easily as we would like it too. After the first year though it does get so much better. Hang tough girl, you're almost there, xoxo
    Oh MLMR.  You are doing so great.  If I was there, I would be screaming right there with you.  That is what friends do.
    Like @jillar, the first year was hard for me too, and in retrospect, I made it harder on myself by  indulging too many smokey thoughts.  I should have snuffed them immediately.

Great news M !  This thread of your quit is an incredible truthful document and will have far reaching effects. I am so glad you feel ready to bring it back to the world.  Thank you.Edited July 15 by Sazerac
    I'm glad you changed your mind ....if it helps folks ...you have done a wonderful thing .!!!!
    Thanks Doreen! I actually just thought about it, originally I started this thread in the introduction section (hence the title haha). Maybe its better at its place there? 
    Glad you decided to put this in a page that can be accessed by everyone. It's an honest testament to the struggle we all go through in trying to establish our quits and what makes it special is that you were successful in doing just that all the while leaving a trail of bread crumbs for others to follow. We all have said at some point or other; "If I can quit, anyone can!" Well, you actually wrote it all down and showed new quitters how you did it!    Good Job!    
@MLMR, I think this is a great place for your thread because it shows your whole journey  
    @MLMR, great to see your accomplishment.  You've done so well.
I have to chime in and tell you, @MLMR, glad you reconsidered...this whole thread you started to introduce yourself will be so helpful to many as they struggle through the first weeks and months of this life-changing quit journey. Carry on, keep calm...and above all, KTQ! Edited July 15 by Rozuki
☆ Happy stats ☆     It's been 329 days and 22 hrs since I quit. I saved 2309 euro's (Yeah. Its all there ). I avoided smoking 7258 cigarettes. And I'm on 90.4% of my very first year smoke free.       I fit my pre-quitting pants again. My last SOS was on the 1st of april. Breathing still improving, in fact, Im finally learning to breath deep without anxiety taking over. Oh, how frustrated I was the first half year when people kept telling me to breath conciously, yet that would only induce panick.       Each time I conquer a short or longer period of Junkie Thinking, my relief and awareness of homecoming grows exponentially. This is so friggin' worth everything!    Edited July 18 by MLMR
    Way to go MLMR you are really starting to see the overall benefits of quitting --- great job!!!!!
    I can't begin to express how valuable reading this thread is to a rookie. MLMR, you are my scout and my inspiring hero. I Thank You.
There's one thing that absolutely motivates me to KTQ and that is that I never ever can be sure I would attempt another quit. And if so, how that would work out.   Some time ago... I remember being well into the first year, so extremely proud. I took great pride in quitting, really on top of the world after every crave I conquered. One year became one and a half, two and finally three. I actually inspired some friends: if she can, why not us? Time went by, I hardly ever missed my nicotine killer. And I actually felt... great. But then I did the unthinkable. Smoked a (tobacco)joint during a festival, afterwards a cigarette. Because, what the hell and tomorrow no one will remember (ah, but no. The real reasons ofcourse were some left over receptors going bonkers). The music died out, people crawled into their tents. The next morning I had coffee with a cig. And though I kept a straight and tough girl face, I knew at that point it all had been for nothing. Shame and self doubt made its way back into my mind.    Fast forward, six or seven years later .. august 22, 2018... it had to be now or never. This time around, things were different. Lots of bumps in the road, none of that first timers pride. I had to work to feel proud, I literally had to create happines around this whole event. On a few occasions it was like my world was falling apart and I had to get it from idontknowwhere. Ofcourse it hasnt all been straight forward misery, but no way is it comparable to these previous three years of quitting. And let that be my guide then. I will never ever want to do this again, ever. I will not grieve and crave a cigarette. I will not cry over a crashed relationship again while aching for a smoke. I wont have any guaranteed life happenings be affected by the thought of cigarettes. I will never ever let that mf nicotine mess up my soul again and I am prepared to make this a life time thing. Because I want to be as free as free can be.Edited July 25 by MLMR
    Imagine: living as long as you remember with a roommate who, for no apparant reason, yells at you and calls you names. He thinks youre the stinkiest, nastiest, most stupid person ever to have set foot on this planet. 'Any day now, girl, any day now.. the world will discover the imposter you really are. You c*nt'   You roommate wont tell you about his daily schedule and you have literally no idea what his business is. He can show up for no reason and make your day miserable as hell. The best part for your roommate is the moment where you loose it and start to hurt yourself out of sheer misery: just to target your despair. He then turns silent and looks at you with a content smile, slowly backing off, retreating behind a door which you have never been through.    Well, obviously I live with this roommate and obviously he doesnt truly exist. Yet, I hear his voice very clear, almost every day. Ive tried fighting the little fellow with all sorts of therapies and medication. We made agreements, we stuck it out, I found ways to do my job while still dealing with this guy. Me and my family healed together, yet this roommate stays. He changes with every trauma I manage to clear , but... he's always there and probably will be for some time.  Ok, on-topic. What I want to say is simply this: if I can quit smoking, surely you can too. And if I have the benefits... surely you do too!    What you are up to, are just bloody receptors. Its their job to make it personal: grief, sadness, joy, boredom etc. And its your job to recognize this and act, by not acting on it: dont light up. Its truly a waist of time to wonder 'why everybody can quit but me'. We all can. Even I can, when being haunted by this shit-ass voices, these beliefs, and everything that comes along with living with it. Smoking is something that I never, éver want to incorporate again. I really do believe each day now gets me closer to where I want to be. Gradually I will be able to relax about it, without loosing my vigilance and guard. I look forward to be done with this once and for all. But you know what? The rewards are so abundant that I gladly keep my promis to myself alive, for each and every day to come. If thats what it takes, so be it.     How about you?  P.s. sorry about the heavy note. Cheering has never been my strong suit. Ahum. That smiley ^^ , I put it there on purpose.
    MLMR, you have come a long way.  You recognize that roommate and have take the necessary steps to deal with him and to top that, you have quit smoking.   You are a super hero!
Love this, truly hits home.  I really like the way you have been documenting recently especially as you get closer to that 1 year mark.  Very well said, very well done!!!!!!
    Take a bow, MLMR.  You're a champion.
    I'm so proud of how far you've come MLMR, I just hope that you are as proud of yourself as we are. And thank you from the bottom of my heart for this journal. Xoxo

I went away this weekend, with friends. We had laughs, good talks, great hikes, everything was there. And I had literally zero thoughts of smoking. Jup. Just like that.    I am exited about being smoke free for almost one year. A year! That seemed like forever, not too long ago..    Oh and what a journey! Edited August 6 by MLMR

@MLMR Another 2 weeks, and you will have conquered one year
One doesnt make this shit up. Unbelievable! Had a scare party at 4 AM..         What I love about this: its not in the slightest way tempting to  light up after this dream. Nope, the shock is only proof of my huge investment of the past year.      Yihaa, 358 days!     Edited August 15 by MLMR
    Oh yea MLMR, I totally remember waking after a bad dream and instantly going and having a smoke. So glad to be past that too!  
    You got this girl.  Your special day is just around the corner.     Isn't this a wonderful feeling?   Smoking is now a remnant of our past.  
So! Exactly twelve months ago, after introducing myself, someone on this board asked me: 'Why wait any longer? Quit now!'. (The plan was 24-08-2019). And so I quit that day, the 22nd of august.       Did it go as I expected? Not at all. Am I happy about the outcome? Yes, yes and yes!        What I expected and remembered from a previous 3year-quit, was struggle, revelation after revelation, strength, bliss and eternal happines. What I experienced this time was a true rollercoaster,which I never ever intent to go through again. I've sos-ed many times, I wrote, I read and studied, Ive fought real hard to keep my sanity at some points.. I yelled at the addiction, I cursed it. And I loved every single minute where I knew I was doing the right thing. Ive had many night time conversations with some friends on this board, these were a big part of what dragged me through. Reading back through everything brings tears to my eyes, because its about my no.1 challenge with quitting: I was so afraid of loosing connection with myself and then just giving up. And I found connection here with you guys and that made me re-establish the connection with myself.         This recent month, things have moved ahead altogether more quickly. I know 'the magic is happening', to quote Doreen. I could write down an endless list of pro's, but I think it come's down to these three: self respect, breathing and health. It feels so, só good to leave the struggle behind, to be at peace with smokey memories.. whatever comes my way I'll be able to face head-on. This journey won't end here, that much I know.       Thank you for being there for me and each other, for providing so much information, support, hugs, tough love, fun. It's been an amazing time and I am absolutely grateful to have 'met' you all. And I hope you, newbie who reads this,  realise quitting smoking is possible. You have it in you, as I do, as we all do.       Edited August 22 by MLMR
    Just so you have all your parties in one portal, MCome On Peeps !   andThe Lido Deck Welcomes MLMR
Things are taking shape here, literally: I lost 15lbs of food love and it feels great! I took my first yoga class ever this evening, because I am finding out I truly have breathing issues. I will be doing this once a week from now on. And don't be fooled.. its friggin' tough! Ive had the hair bun for years already, so that comes in handy right now.  Now that the leaves are changing colours, I made a mood boosting list to be in time, once and for all. The list includes the infamous SADlamp, baking cinnamon apple pies, taking daily 30' walks, exercizing with breathing, doing projects that involve smell, taste, touch and hearing etc. And most importantly, being NICE to myself. I know, this all sounds a bit Psychology Magazine-ish... but well... screw that!     I have a feeling that I'm spot on, this time. And quitting smoking played a huge role. I am going to continue this second year with so much more confidence, what a difference. Keep on keeping on, its worth it all!Edited September 4 by MLMR
That is wonderful to hear MLMR.   I am also working on those extra 25 pounds I gained during my quit.  I am doing a two mile walk every day.    I don't think your post sounds Magazinish.  It sounds like you are confident, happy and healthier.

I mean... I just woke up, have the day off and plenty plans for today. Usually I made coffee, smoked at least three cigarettes, maybe just one more, and then started doing something, probably taking a shower, and then right after that rushing to ... smoking... the smoke cycle, all day long...
    Yaaaa.....The magic keeps on -a- comin .......
    Tomorrow Im off to Portugal.    Very happy to:  • be packing my suitcase without a rush • have enough money for this trip   • look around at the airport and enjoy the buzz, instead of being on the lookout for a smoking zone • have energy, walk walk walk, enjoy every single moment perfectly happy without a cigarette, climbing steep streets with enough air.... And so much more!      Funny, while writing this, its actually a bit awkward to say the words 'cigarette' and 'smoking' more than once... they truly moved to a section in my brain where theres not much activity anymore.        Yet, I want to focus from time to time on the effects and rewards of quitting by writing here. Because, this quit is meant to last!
    Tudo Bem !       
@MLMR  we have the same anniversary. 
    Have a great smoke free holiday sweetheart ...Portugal is lovely ....
    Coming here, bc I need to.. having smokey thoughts and a difficult time adressing them properly. There's wine, there's arguments, there's this typical 'holiday tension' thing... how on earth can it seem like a cigarette would solve all of that right now? This seems like a major, major  case of examining HALT.. ?
    OMG MLMR!  Don't give into those nasty thoughts.  You have come to far.  I guess that is why we will always be addicts because it creeps upon us when unexpe ted.  Just breath gurl.  This too shall pass.

    Good on you for posting MLMR, this too shall pass and it will be yet another hurdle conquered, xoxo
    Keep thinking about how happy you've been lately to be smoke free, and you'll be back there before you know it and these passing thoughts will be long gone.  
    New location and situation for you likely so those thoughts get dredged up from somewhere deep in your subconscious maybe? In any case, handle it the same way you did in the thick of your quit. You managed to use logical thought then to figure out what the truths were and which path to follow. I have complete faith that you will do the same now because you are a nonsmoker and want to remain one for life - right?              
    I appreciate your answers a lot, thanks so much. I hate it, to have these strong thoughts about smoking after such a long time.     I dont really know what else to say, but it didnt seem right to say nothing at all.. so...yeah.          
"I appreciate your answers a lot, thanks so much. I hate it, to have these strong thoughts about smoking after such a long time.    I dont really know what else to say, but it didnt seem right to say nothing at all.. so...yeah"         How long did you smoke ?    Understand that smoking changed your DNA    and imprinted itself in every particle of your being for how many years ?   You have been quit a year and a month.  What is the ratio of freedom vs. addiction ?    See ?       Oh good, I just found Cristóbal's post about this, it is good.Cristóbal's Quit Days %       Don't 'hate' the thoughts, that gives them too much power.  Acknowledge them and blow them away like a dandelion.Edited September 26 by Sazerac
Been trying to write something for some time now, but kept postponing.          Quitting..  it becomes more and more a 'far from my bed show' as we say in Holland. And yet, almost on a daily basis Im aware  of the impact it has on me.      Still entering new fases, still have moments of utter joy about quitting and what it does for me, still have the occasional 'Id like one now' moment, but so so soooo minor in comparison to everything good about quitting...      Words that cross my mind when I think about what good it does to me, are: steadier, more relaxed, able to tell people to wait and 'let me get back at you', gradually coming home in my body and mind.. trusting the proces,  a healthier relationship with food.       I quit before, for over 3 years. But... never did I expect the journey to be like this, when 14 months ago I decided it was time to quit, once and for all, etc.  It makes me even more sure about never lighting up again..  for all I know this was my last chance...  the nicotine industry wont own me as a slave no more.

Accepting the truth that we are nicotine addicts leads to accepting other truths and of recognizing truths without denial.  This has been one of the greatest gifts that my quit has given me, that I have given myself.    The honesty to delve deep, the compassion to accept and learn to understand what I find in my excavations...        It has been remarkable to learn about your journey which, in many ways, resembles all of our journeys.  I thank you for your awareness, your honesty and your willingness to express your journey here, M.
    I like to read the updates of ppl on this train! It's motivating and hopeful!   Thank you fellow dutchie! 
Ai, actually just had a receptor turning in it's grave. No apparant reason, I think I'll stash it under 'Brains Whatever'. It was a darn sturdy receptor though. Shush, go back to your beautiful sleep now.        Counting the days and noticing its been exactly 15 months since I quit. I think I'll treat myself today!     Edited Friday at 12:36  AM by MLMR

    That'll teach those damn cravings that pop up out of nowhere! Cute jacket 
For me, I always wished that I was not addicted to Nicotine,  and I alway planned to stop some day,  just not that day... The thing that got to me was my young son reading the health warning and crying because it said smoking kills. He asked if it would kill me.  I told him that it wouldn't kill me. He asked why it wouldn't?..... I was speechless.  He had called me out on my own delusions.  He pulled my head out of my cosy sand pit and made me face it head on.  I told him it wouldn't kill me because I wasn't going to do it anymore.  I planned to quit on new years eve.  But woke the following morning (21st Dec 2011) and could not smoke. The protective Father in me could not put one more puff of smoke into my body. I realised that I had just succeeded,  that I had quit.
I always wished that I was not addicted to Nicotine too, but in my case i was good rugby and soccer player and im im trying to get back to top training and competition. Also health and skin coghing among many things! 
For a variety of reasons actually.  Being diagnosed at 37 with mild COPD (bronchitis/emphysema), my son picking up one and pretending to smoke, that constant annoying cough that never went away; I could go on and on, but those top the list.  By the way, that annoying cough?  Gone within a week of quitting  :D
When I admitted to myself that smoking was more important than anything in my life.  That was unacceptable to me but it was true.  I left my children in the house while I went outside to smoke many times per day.  I smoked while driving with the window down, dumb enough to think they weren't breathing any of it.  They watched me smoke.  Yet I continued on knowing what I was doing to my health and that I was cutting their time down with me. My Dr. told me "don't sit here and tell me that your daughter is the most important thing in your life because she's not.  Cigarettes are."  That was a tough pill to swallow but after I thought about it and what he said to me, he was right.  I couldn't let my addiction to smoking come before my family ever again.  Never again will my children smell smoke on my breath or see me with a cigarette dangling from my mouth.  Never.
I am not sure how to answer the question What made you decide to quit.  I have always wanted to quit I have always known that smoking is not good for you.  I have always known that my second hand smoke was not good for other people. I have tried to quit many times without success. I have always known that I should quit. This time there was really no choice I did not have to decide to quit .. I had to quit  for me.  Okay I am going to say I did not make this choice until I joined the quit train. I would not have done it otherwise.  :)
There are many reasons to quit. I think what finally made me quit was me realizing that I couldn't justify smoking anymore. I was standing outside, sick, smoking away. I'd take a drag and cough like crazy. I couldn't understand why I was doing this to myself. So I quit. What kept me motivated was family, my age, health, and money. I was only 25 when I quit and I was already so scared of the damage I did to my body. I saw so many loved ones struggle with emphysema and COPD. It scared me to think I might get that way.  I also thought of how much time I wasted smoking and how I could have been spending it with the people I loved. Those minutes are precious to me, because you never know what's going to happen or if there will even be a tomorrow.
I was only 25 when I quitYou have given yourself the gift of a lifetime.  I wish I had quit so long ago.   Please never go back.  Your so young and you can undo everything smoking has done to you.   Never ever go back to poisoning yourself.  No.  Matter.  What.
Cause I felt like it :) 
My oldest son begging me to quit and my teeth were suffering.
The Doc and Impending Decrepitude convinced The Sarge that it was time.  Easy Peasy
So many reasons, had been trying on and off for a number of years, knew it was not good for me, but clung onto the "it wont happen to me" syndrome for as long as I could, my oldest son started smoking, didn't faze me, then my youngest told me I would die if I continued and partner told me he and my children need me, simples , my health was suffering too, scared of having a heart attack, my mum took angina at 51 and fast approaching that age, the cost of cigarettes I could no longer justify being heavily in debt and burning money so so many reasons, but mainly I wanted to quit for me.
I have 2 people in my life that I would die for...... I am quitting smoking for those same 2 people.  Except this time, I want to live for them.
This is the 3rd time today I have tried to answer this. I quit because I got scared. I am pretty ashamed I didn't quit for the children I love so much, or to set an example to others I love so long ago. I quit because it was beyond time and I had run out of excuses. I won't smoke again but will spend a lifetime trying to make up for being such a selfish idiot.
I quit for Freedom. How could an apparently intelligent man, in charge of all aspects of his life, wilfully kill himself slowly and allow an addiction to dictate his life....
I quit because I was at risk of having my feet amputated....and being in a wheel chair.....Also,watching my hubby with severe c.o.p.d....on oxygen 16hours a day....also in a wheel chair when he leaves the house.....This scared the crap out of me.....
There was a domino-effect-thing that was going on that led up to my quit.-Hubby quit smoking. He was my final smoking buddy in the family. (I was so mad. Not supportive at all. I was a selfish, addicted beeotch) :(-My lifelong best friend died.....as a direct result of smoking. The cancer did things to her beautiful face that would make you cry and possibly vomit if I described in detail. :(-Then....the happy reason.......my first grandbaby was born :) I didnt ever want him to know me as the grandma who smelled like an ashtray. Or the sick grandma. Or the grandma who couldnt run, or was on oxygen. Nope.....he will never know a smoking grandma.  
I quit for me as I didn`t want it to be who I wasI quit as I think I have dodged a bullet for so long and don`t want to play Russian Roulette with my life anymoreI saw my dad die just 6 years older than I am now with lung cancerI am seeing my mum so disabled from smoking related diseases - I do not want that for meI love my loved ones around me and want to be seen to fight for my freedom (that ones for you jess)
I was sick and went to Doctor after no smoking for a couple of days due to a sore throat and he said, you have already quit, try to keep it going and I did! Almost 6 months later and never looked back! But it took a honest try, no back up smokes or stash of emergency smokes, just do it attitude!
    Bump
After a trip to CA where smoking was problematic and a coughing fit on the aeroplane,   I decided not to light up when I landed and see if I could quit smoking as a challenge to myself.       Googled everything about quitting, nicotine, cold turkey and luckily found Joel Spitzer.    Lurked here and there and 10 months into my quit, I jumped on QTrain.
Hello fellow quitters and lurkers!  For those residing in the US,  the most wonderful time of the year is upon us.  We are scheduled to grossly overeat a week from today.  More than usual.        While doing so, we will  be giving thanks for:  our perfect families, the variety of enchanting edibles available to all guests. This includes gluten free, dairy free, vegetarian, nut- free, organic, non-lumpy gravy, red white and rosé offerings from the cellar, mashed cauliflower, stuffing and/or dressing with and without cornbread, with and without oysters, with and without pecans.  Cranberry sauce from a can & some homemade. We rejoice to sample the doctored brussels sprouts sautéed in duck fat with charred gizzards (I don’t think charred gizzards is a thing. I added for even more dramatic effect).  Your football team will win Saturday!         We celebrate our hard working co-workers. We enjoy delightful conversations with kind strangers in the 10 mile long line at the grocery store.    Holiday cheer is real and abounds in our hearts and homes.  We bought the perfect gifts for everyone  on clearance last year so we have extra cash and no gift buying stress.     If your life is this easy going with zero holiday stress- congratulations !!  You are super human and I need your autograph!        Forced family functions,  imbibing in too much merriment, living through the season when someone you loved and lost is not-     are all fuel that could send you to the store for that one pack to get you through it all.  Or, the kindling to bum a smoke from your boss at the holiday party.        Have your plan in place.  Newbies and old phartes (more seasoned quitters) are both at risk for losing a quit to stress, to feeling nostalgic for past celebrations.        Don’t lose your quit. Embrace it. Celebrate it. Protect it. Be thankful for it!!        Gobble til you wobble.  Watch the game.         Don’t smoke.        NOPE!!      L4L
    Great post lust, this will be a hard holiday season for my family so thank you for this timely reminder to KTQ! 
    I love this post also.  Spending time with my family, during the holidays, is enough to drive me crazy but not drive me back to smoking.  It amazes me that I am no longer a smoker. I will take the time to NOPE the rest of my life!!!!!!!
I started a thread almost three years ago about quitting cold turkey and how much dis-information was out there when I first quit.  I was so fortunate to find Joel Spitzer.Now, it seems, the dis-information is even more ubiquitous...        here is a link to WhyQuit for resources about quitting Cold Turkey      and my original post from 2016, Quitting Smoking Cold Turkey    I am fully aware that my choice of quitting cold turkey is not for everyone but, education about addiction and all methods of quitting should be forefront,  especially those methods that do not involve Big Tobacco as in gum/patches* and vaping*    Education is freedom.  Knowledge is power.  *The Shady Link Between Big Tobacco and Nicotine Gum*Big Tobacco Lobbied To Save Vaping, Now Controls Leading E-Cigarette Company           Edited Wednesday at 11:49  AM by Sazerac
I quit Cold Turkey this time around - including after my one day failure at 3 weeks (Grrrr) . As I had a bit of a medical scare, quitting smoking was a non negotiable thing with me .  I have just tried to not allow myself to feel sorry for myself and it has been quite easy this time .
@Steve63 you are spot on to change your attitude about your quit! That's what's helped me to be successful this time around. We can't feel sorry for ourselves--we aren't missing out on anything! Smoking is not something to be missed. Once we realize that, we have won half the battle!
The first time I read Allen Carr's Easyway, I remember reading the bit about waking up in the morning and saying "Yippee!  I am a nonsmoker!" and thinking it was just plain goofy.  I was wrong. Last night I listened to a podcast featuring Dave Asprey interviewing neuroscientist Robert Cooper.  Cooper spoke of the importance of "tripping the switch" in your brain during the first twenty-two minutes of the day.  This time is vital as it marks the most significant shift from the subconscious to the conscious during the day.  What you think and how you think during the first twenty-two minutes in the morning sets the tone for the rest of your day. Thought processes change throughout the day and it is impossible to plan for all the external factors that affect our mindset.  However, "aiming the brain" in the right direction first thing in the morning sets a positive path for the rest of the day. This goes against my nature, but out of respect to Mr. Carr...YIPPEE! 
I love this! Totally spot on. You can change so many aspects of your life (including reinforcing being a happier non smoker) in the morning. Upon waking to be think of how thankful you are, even if it's just one thing. Just doing this one thing can seriously transform your day and eventually it becomes habit and you can lift your moods very naturally to face each day with a positive mindset. x
YIPPEE, I'm a Non-Smoker!!!
Easy to believe.  
Love this post!   Yippee indeed.  I'll be giving this a try.  Thanks Boo.
Great info Boo , I'm going to use this reinforcement technique when I have my coffee sans ciggie in the morning no matter how grumpy I'm feeling lol 
Boo...thanks for the reminder... after 52 years...I'm a fantastic non smoker..Great post...

Make sense. I wake happy. Mrs is pissed.  Stays that way all day. 
Make sense. I wake happy. Mrs is pissed. Stays that way all day. Totally. Just think of the first thing you each see waking up.
We love your excitement about quitting!  Attitude makes such a difference!  I tried to stay upbeat and positive in the beginning.  I had a few low moments (cried on the floor like a baby one day), but overall was so happy to quit!!!  It changed my life - I gained so much! 
Can you share or PM the link to the podcast you were listening, too?

The reality is you gain a ton of insight which will support you throughout life. Not in the woe is me way we suspect of quitting - but it's almost like our minds have time to process things differently. Actually having lots more time available means you have time to try new things too :)  So geek away, love it! x
Guess what I thought about immediately after hitting snooze?  :) (actually, I've practiced "setting the intention of the day" for a while, just wasn't aware of the 22 min factor)

Does make sense.  If you don't take aim then your...aimless.
Thank you.
Thank you. You're welcome.  I have downloaded several podcasts that I haven't gotten around to listening to yet.  If any are particularly good and relevant to this forum in any way, I will pass them along.
Makes sense. I would get up, make coffee, check facebook and email, and make my nope pledge. I never thought I'd be able to give up that first smoke of the morning, but the first day I quit I got up and came on here and typed NOPE, and didn't smoke all day. So I guess that 22 min thing has some credence to it. Which reminds me, I should start doing my nope pledges again. I stopped for some reason and just didn't pick it back up again.

I do enjoy a trip down memory lane from time-to-time.       Three-and-a-half years removed from deciding to quit and now not smoking feels far more normal than lighting one up would.  However, back in the early days every milestone felt huge and every time I accepted a new way of thinking it felt like an epiphany.     The challenges encountered early on in a quit only set the stage for moments of satisfaction and victory.Edited Tuesday at 09:20  PM by Boo

Exactly this ^^     I exploited these moments as much as I could, going over them again and again, celebrating in my own way and somehow trying to anchor them. That way I was building on something too valuable to lose. And... it worked!
If it wasnt for quitting smoking, I wouldnt have been...    • gradually, over the past year, deep cleaning my house to the point where I feel at home and at ease again • succesfully negotiating my job position and salary    • taking up yoga classes (and even liking them) • saving money for a piano ánd being able to deal with some unexpected financial surprises  • picking up writing again  • losing 22 lbs • re-doing my bedroom   And on a more subtle, but very meaningful level:    • accepting and adjusting to some major changes in my personal life • coming to a new understanding with anxiety    • learning to say 'I need some time. Let me get back at that'.  • learning to be less (self)judgemental • slowly gaining back some concentration, which I use to read. Thats major, after years of depression and fighting for my sanity.   The other day I ran into someone I havent talked to in a long time. She said these unforgettable words: 'its like you are more at peace now, not being haunted by some invisible raging inner critic'. And thats exactly how it is! At the time it all seemed to go sooo veeeeerryyyyy sloooow. I nearly lost patience and kept complaining about the time it took for the patterns to, well, die. I clearly remember my desperation at smokey thoughts: "does this ever stop?!". And now I am almost three months into my second year and Im able to look back at that time, with nothing less than satisfaction and an insane amount of gratitude.    To the hero strugglers, keep going. You will feel better at some point, you will get there. Every day done and dusted is another promis for change. Thoughts about smoking will diminish, unrest will settle and you will find ways to give different meaning to whatever personal issues this addiction forces you to work with.       It is doable and more than worth it, for me as well as for you!  Edited November 15 by MLMR
    Another great post MLMR, thank you for sharing. I'm glad to read about all the positive changes that have happened for you 
    Thanks Jill, but I should actually thank YOU and the others, for the neverending support you provide. The support and the storytelling here makes this such a wonderful and valuable place. 
    And you know what, maybe I didnt even mention the biggest change: I DO stuff! Like getting up early to take walks, going to movies, taking my mom to places, visiting friends more than I used to, facing sh*t instead of hiding ... somehow life isnt passing me by anymore. 
    This was a great honest post @MLMR....  I'm so happy for you ...and it has been a honour to ride the Train with you ....    We hid behind smoking ,much more than we knew ...
    Being honest with yourself.  Setting a goal and accomplishing it.  Learning how to be comfortable with being uncomfortable.  Recognizing the value of patience over instant gratification.  These are all skills necessary to successfully quit smoking and skills that will serve you well in every area of your life.     Quitting smoking is a great choice in and of itself.  Quitting smoking will also prove to be a catalyst for positive change in areas seemingly unrelated to quitting smoking.       Great post MLMR.
    Beautiful post, M.  It has been astounding watching your journey and reading your posts.    We are so lucky you found us and have shared so much of yourself here.      You quit smoking....and the residual effects will continue to reveal themselves.    The honesty involved affects everything and the trust we earn in ourselves shines a light on everything we do.
    Now you understand why we celebrate anyone that breaks free from nicotine addiction.  I've read a lot of remarkable stories on this forum.
Awesome post, MLMR.  Great to hear about all the positive changes in your life.     22 lbs????  Please share the secret.
@d2e8b8, I do 5:2 intermittent fasting.     (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/the-5-2-diet-guide)       Basically you eat normal for 5 days and mimic fasting for 2 days. On fasting days you consume a restricted amount of calories: max 500 kcal women, 600 kcal for men. Apart from the apparant health benefits (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting#section1) its supposed to help you lose weight. Well, I clearly do.       Most of the time i find it easy to do. I expected to be binge eating on regular days, but its actually the opposite, Im less hungry and tend to make healthier food choices, without the feeling of depriving myself.        Edited November 16 by MLMR
    Thanks MLMR.  Both my husband and I need to address the extra pounds these days.  This even sounds doable throughout the holidays.  
Its definitely doable @Linda Thomas Just Make sure you get your elektrolytes, in order to prevent a headache.       On a 5:2 day I usually skip breakfast (also on non-fasting days now) and then have a simple salad or some pre-steamed vegetables for lunch. Dinner is often more veggies, these days mostly roasted pumpkin, zucchini, onion etc. Often with salmon or chicken.         On regular days I really dont mind kcals, but to my huge surprise Im not as hungry or craving for mindlessly putting eatable things in my mouth as I was before. I can have my wine and beer like I used to and I still bake with  butter. In general Im a lot less ocupied with food and I really love that! Edited November 16 by MLMR
    Thank you, such a positive and happy post, with objective milestones which you have reached. Being thankful creates a loving journey.

I am definitely trying this.  I think my husband will do well with this also.  He has to have knee replacement in January, after he retires.  I think he would do better with the surgery if he loses some weight.  I will keep you up on our progress.
So I called quit line and got some help to quit smokes.  I wasn't a huge smoker, had cut down to between 6 - 10 a day most days but for a long time.        anyway I got the patches and lozenges they send out and started using them.  Had a pretty good week at first. using the patches and a few lozenges a day was making it through.  One thing that I felt really helped was forgetting the patch one day about 3 days in and being so strung out that it helped me realise that the patches were helping and gave me a huge boost in confidence for the following days.        The problem I have is that on the first day after applying the patch I felt like I had a pain in the bone of my arm, all day like someone gave me a really good dead arm, the next day I move the patch to mu other arm, and the pain followed.  I looked it up online and found this wasn't the most uncommon thing and that my pain seemed mild compared to some of the posts.    The n ext day I put the patch on the back o0f my shoulder, and from this point I had pain in my kidneys .. it started mild but after a few more days was getting quite pronounced and playing on my thoughts all the time.  I decided to stop using the patches and see how I went with just the lozenges, still only using maybe 5 or 6 lozenges a day I managed to push thorough but the kidney pain persisted. I hoped it would subside, the next day it was just as bad if not worse and had not been using a patch for 2 days.         So then I stopped taking the lozenges, and after a couple of days the pain had all but gone, but I was really struggling with my mood and generally ability to focus on literally anything at all,      So now I am at the point where I feel like the patches and lozenges are causing side effects that I just cannot deal with, even though I could tell they were helping me with the smoking.  I know some people that used those Champix tablets and basically went mental, my sister in law for one so much so that we no longer have any contact with them at all and we used to see them most weekends.        I guess my only way forward is cold turkey but that's really tough on everyone and difficult with work.  I feel like I need a 'something to look forward to'  like how when you get home from work and can turn on your 'relax' mode I don't really drink much except occasional 'events' like a big BBQ or whatever but day to day I don't really drink at all.        I've gotten some green tea with lemon which is quite nice and almost fills that hole but I guess maybe I was wondering if anyone else had experienced similar problems wioth the NRT patches and lozenges.      thanks  DC
    Welcome deadlychicken and congratulations on taking back your life. I quit cold turkey so I can't help with your NRT problem but we have many members who did and will be around to offer their input I'm sure. No matter which method you use though, you'll need to be prepared for some discomfort. I assure you it's temporary and well worth getting through to conquer this nasty habit.  If you decide to stay with cold turkey I would recommend stocking up on sweets to suck on and drink lots of water/juice to help flush the nicotine out quicker. You've made a great decision to quit this deadly habit and we're glad to have you aboard 
    G'day @DeadlyChicken....nice to have another Aussie onboard.        So I used the NRT chewies to get through the first months. Luckily no side effects.     I have mates who have had successfully quit using champix without side effects. I wouldn't recommend it though because the side effects can be deadly, a month in hospital with a DVT taught me that.       I would mix up the NRT gums with pks or extra or Chuppa Chups.      Minties and Fantales are ripper options...they take long enough to eat that the crave will pass.
Welcome aboard ...  Congratulations on your decision to take your life back ... Cold turkey here too....chewed regular gum ....came here   24/7.... Read all you can ..knowledge makes you stronger ..  You can do it !!!

Hi, thanks for the support, I will say if I didn't make myself clear in the opening post.  that quitlline is awesome, they give you 3 months of patches and gum or lozenges for free, in three deliveries.  So I have the first delivery and am thinking about just telling them to not bother with the others when it comes time ( they ring you once a week to chat about your week etc ) I think its a really good way to kick things off.  And it does make you answerable to someone if you don't have anyone else at the moment to be answerable to so I found that it was one of those sort of steps you cant take back once youo taken it and helps get your head in the right space.  Recommend to anyone who may have tried alone and struggled before, or who thinks that they want to try the NRT stuff but are scared of the price.  3 months should be enough to quit and not have to spend a cent.       Tonight we went to a friends for a BBQ and beers … normally would have been a time that I might have smoked a lot more than normal, but didn't really crave at all.  I took some lozenges with me but didn't need to pop any ( would have messed up the beers flavour  ) fingers crossed.  Now to see if a hangover without smoking is any better than one with smoking  nn
I agree with everything @Boo posted.    I quit cold turkey and highly recommend quitting this way.  Free and clean.  Just stop smoking or ingesting nicotine.   It is a poison, you know.   Educate yourself about nicotine addiction.      I offer two links from our friend, Joel SpitzerPharmacological Crutches andKeeping NRT in case of emergency          Edited November 16 by Sazerac
    Welcome DeadlyChicken, I also went cold turkey.  I do think it is better to just bite the bullet and get the nicotine out of your system.  This forum is a great place for information and support.  We are here to help guide you to freedom.  Stay close and shout out when you need us.  Keep that wonderful quit going!  
    Well done of doing the Barbie smoke free, from memory the anxiety of faving it was harder than not smoking while I was there.       Hope you don't have the SOLs too bad.
I’m watching children in need (UK BBC1). These kids and their parents kind of bring things down to earth . I always end up in bits , as I am now watching these amazing people . The little lad that has to get his lungs emptied and hates it and the “public funded” people that help them out ! WTF . I chose to inhale  poison into my lungs ending in more than 40 a day ? Poor us as quitters - that is never an excuse .
Here is a great thread from WhyQuit in which nicotine addicts tell of the crazy things they did to indulge their addiction.Desperate Addict's Parade        We have some of our own stories on this threadSpoiled Brats/Nicotine Addicts        We all have our similar yet unique stories, lets hear them !        My most memorable was after 9 months of abstinence from smoking,    home birth, healthy baby...I was alive...to my midwives I said, ' Great...now I need a smoke' and one of them gave me a camel straight.     I would collect my old snipes and roll them into a smoke, move refrigerators to find dog ends.  Nothing was keeping me from nicotine and I was completely shameless about it.  I didn't care.       Now, I don't understand how I kept the denial of my addiction intact for all those years...
    I shudder now to think of the times I dug through the trash and/or dirty ashtrays to find smokeable butts. I would also steal cigarettes from my in-laws, who live upstairs, and sneak out behind the garage to smoke them. (This was, of course, when I was trying to hide my habit.)      I once tossed a mostly-full pack of smokes out of my car window when I decided to quit. (I know, littering is bad.) But in a moment of weakness, I drove back to that site and pulled over, searching the embankments on both sides of the road for my pack! (Why I didn't just go straight out and buy a new pack I'll never know.)        I did stupid things to feed my habit.
    When I gave birth to Nicky ....the ash tray was on my cabinet next to my bed ....   Puffing my head off...next to a New Baby .....  Now !!!!.....this makes me angry ....junkie ....
    I remember chain smoking at airports before I got on the plane for a four hour flight while hubby stood outside waiting for his addict to get her fix 
Some of the crazy addict stuff I did....        1. Stole cigs from my parents when I ran out of my own - mind you, they both smoked Pall Mall Red (no filter). Oooh...can't say how many times I ripped the skin off my lower lip after taking a drag!!! Those cigs were harsh!     2. I only used to smoke a cig half-way and then stub it out....so  when I didn't have any...the hunt was on for those 1/2 smoked stubbies...ugh!        3. Going out in the middle of the night in a blinding snowstorm to nearest 7-11 to buy a pack!      4.  Smoking 3 or 4 in a row when at airports between flights...when the security rules changed and you had to go outside the airport to smoke...almost missing connecting flights because of this damned addiction! Planning flights to airports that still had smoking lounges ...even thought it took me way out of my way!!      5. I am a scuba diver and after every dive spent the dive interval time sitting on the boat or a beach and lighting up!!! Crazy, I know!        6. I flew from NYC to Copenhagen once and it felt like torture .....would I have to give up dreams of going to Australia, New Zealand, Alaska and Hawaii?? At the time, I thought so...     So happy that I am smoke-free now....
Saw this somewhere else and thought it useful to post here.  From Whyquit.com.  I like #11 and 12 Summary of Basic Recovery Tips From Freedom from Nicotine by John R. Polito of Whyquit.com1. Law of Addiction - Administration of a drug to an addict will cause re-establishment of chemical dependence upon the addictive substance. Fully accept chemical dependency. Nicotine addiction is as real and permanent as alcoholism. There is no such thing as just one.2. Measure Victory One Day at a Time - Forget about quitting "forever." It's the biggest psychological bite imaginable. Instead, adopt a do-able “one day at a time" recovery philosophy.3. Record Your Motivations - Once in the heat of battle it's normal to forget the reasons that motivated us to begin this journey home. Write yourself a reminder letter and carry it with you.4. Do Not Skip Meals - Each puff of nicotine was our spoon pumping stored fats and sugars into our bloodstream. Why add hunger craves to nicotine craves . Eat little, healthy and often.5. Three Days of Natural Juices - If your health permits and non-diabetic, consider drinking plenty of acidic fruit juice the first three days. Cranberry is excellent.6. Quitting for Others – We cannot quit for others. It must be our gift to us. Quitting for others creates a natural sense of self deprivation that will eat away at you and is a recipe for relapse.7. Attitude - A positive attitude is important. Our subconscious is listening. Think positively.8. Get Rid of All Nicotine - Keeping a stash handy is asking for relapse. Build in time delay.9. Caffeine/Nicotine Interaction - Nicotine doubles the rate by which the body depletes caffeine. Consider a caffeine reduction of up to one-half if troubled by anxieties or poor sleeping.10. Aggressively Extinguish Nicotine Use Cues - Most use cues are extinguished by a single encounter during which the subconscious fails to receive the expected result – nicotine. Subconsciously triggered craves peak in intensity within three minutes. Cessation time distortion may make the minutes feel like hours. Keep a clock handy to maintain honest perspective. Take back your life one cue at a time!11. Crave Coping Techniques - One coping method is to practice slow deep breathing while clearing your mind of all needless chatter by focusing on your favorite person, place or thing. Another exercise is to say your ABCs while associating each letter with your favorite food, person or place. For example, the letter "A" is for grandma's hot apple pie. "B" is for warm buttered biscuits. I think you'll find that you'll never make it to the challenging letter Q before the episode peaks in intensity and victory is yours. Try embracing a crave episode by mentally reaching out inside your mind. A crave cannot cut us, burn us or make us bleed. Be brave just once. In your mind, wrap your arms around the crave's anxiety energy and then sense as it slowly fizzles and dies while in your embrace. Yes, another use cue bites the dust and victory is yours!12. Alcohol Use - Alcohol is associated with 50% of all relapses. Be extremely careful with early alcohol use during. Get your recovery legs under you first. Once ready, consider drinking at home first without nicotine around, going out with friends but refraining from drinking during the first outing, or spacing drinks further apart or drinking water or juice between drinks. Have an escape plan and a backup, and be fully prepared to use both.13. Avoid Crutches - A crutch is any form of reliance that you lean upon so heavily in supporting your recovery that if quickly removed would likely result in relapse.14. No Legitimate Excuse for Relapse - Recognize that using nicotine cannot solve any crisis. Fully accept the fact that there is absolutely no legitimate excuse for relapse, including an auto accident, financial crisis, the end of a relationship, job loss, a terrorist attack, a hurricane, the birth of a baby, falling stocks, or the eventual inevitable death of those we love most.15. Reward Yourself - Consider using some of the money you save to be nice to you. You've earned it! Remember, with drug addiction there's no such thing as just one.16. Just One Rule - There is only one rule which if followed provides a 100% guarantee of success: no nicotine today!http://whyquit.com/ffn/
Great great great, beacon, thank you for posting this. My favorite is #16 and I would put it First. N O P E
Thanks for posting this! It's awesome!
"He/She quit smoking for the rest of their life." When you realize that "quit smoking" is an activity and not an event the sentence takes on a subtly different meaning.   
Now I understood smoking didn't help solve anything ..couldn't change anything...Crap happens to people who have never smoked too...It has to be number 14 for me...once my junkie brain truly understood this.and it sunk in...I felt like a huge fight in the battle was over...
    bump and a hello to Mel and Beacon too.

'It is well-known that smoking is much more common amongst people with mental illness – especially depression and schizophrenia. However, most studies that have looked at this association have not been able to disentangle whether this is a cause-and-effect relationship, and if so in which direction. Does mental illness increase the likelihood of smoking, or is smoking itself a risk factor for mental illness?'     http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/november/smoking.html
    This is very interesting material, I have some thoughts on this subject. But it sucks to type on a mobile. So I will get back on this later 
VV. interesting, thank you M'Life.   "Looking at our current results alongside previous literature, we conclude this strengthens evidence for an effect of smoking on increased risk of depression and schizophrenia.    Future work should attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanisms with a hope to intervene, inform public health messages or further advance our knowledge on the aetiology of mental illness.      In particular, it will be important to consider other constituents of tobacco smoke to determine whether it is exposure to nicotine or some other constituent that increases risk of schizophrenia and depression. This is particularly important in the context of the recent growth in electronic cigarette use."                 Edited November 13 by Sazerac
    For me, it has always been a vicious cycle. I have bipolar depression, and I started smoking after the onset of my first major depressive episode. The nicotine actually seemed to relieve certain aspects of my depression, but it created horrific anxiety with the craving/withdrawal cycle. It also caused me a great deal of shame, which fueled my depression. So I would quit. The anxiety would lessen, but the depression would increase as my dopamine levels plummeted. I'd start smoking again, and the cycle would continue.       I've been doing a lot of personal research into nicotine addiction and mental health, and the more I understand it, the stronger I get in my quit.      Thank you for sharing.

    Awesome post -- Many red flags I have already dealt with -- will keep bookmarked.  Thanks so much for posting
    All true. So true. It's hard to remember these in the thick of it... I recognize several of these on my thoughts.

    Great post, so many I can relate to.    Thank you 
    A great read , thanks .     Now where's the food 
is that you may not ever quit again.  This is a very realistic outcome if you choose to smoke again.  We've all heard that smoking doesn't make anything better when in fact it makes it worse.  It's doesn't calm you down, solve your problems and instead costs a small fortune and kills you. If you've started again, quit and right the ship.  If you're thinking about smoking again, quickly get that thought under control and make a decision based on facts, not emotion.  Emotion is what has always caused me to relapse.  I was pissed off, stressed or in some funk.  Here are a couple of videos to give you some things to think about work through this.  Just hang on, before you know it these rough times will pass.  :)  Stay positive and stick around here.  With the nuts we have here (I'm the lead nut, thank you very much) you can't help but stay at least a little bit positive. The Power Of Nicotine Addiction Video explains the full power of the grip that nicotine can take on an individual and the consequences that can be faced if a person does not quit smoking. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpYRrZG5l8A Who Wants To Go Back To Smoking?This video discusses how former smokers at times think they want to go back to smoking, but if they really remind themselves of the package deal that goes along with being a smoker, it will be easy for them to stick to their quit. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG9qGjf2hd8&list=PL76365B6CE2DA076B Are You Stronger Than Your Cigarettes?This video discusses the importance of understanding that you won't be able to quit smoking and stay free by becoming stronger than cigarettes but rather by becoming smarter than nicotine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxLxDuTOCT0 "It's Inevitable, Some Smokers Are Going To Relapse" If you are a member of any quit smoking support group, whether it be online or a live program, it is likely that some members of your group are going to fail. You should not interpret this fact to mean that it is likely or inevitable that you are going to fail. Video spells out the major difference between people who relapse and those who don't. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ego_dpPmfOk
Acknowledge The Negative But Dwell On The PositiveVideo discusses benefits of working on developing a positive attitude about quitting smoking. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbu6onu0N_s
Great video's MQ.  
    Keep The Quit....no matter how hard it is...as stated it could be years or even never before you have the will to have another attempt....  That way...you only go through it once ..
Never quit quitting.    Nobody is a lost cause or a special snowflake.  No one is more addicted than anyone else.   We are all nicotine addicts and can choose to put our addiction to sleep.       Commit to NOPE.  Not One Puff Ever. Commit to NOPE as if your life depends on it    for it very well might !Edited November 12, 2018 by Sazerac
Start quitting today and don't quit on your quit.   Tomorrow isn't promised for anyone; why let this chance pass you by??   Everyone deserves the freedom and happiness that comes with a solid quit. Please give yourself this gift.Edited November 13, 2018 by c9jane29

Well my second time quit and I would have been three years at Christmas there are no excuses been made redundant I've had two spinal operations I've got heart issues and I got blood issues no excuse I had a drink I have a smoke and now I'm smoking again.  like I said no excuses I am gutted because I'm coughing and shortness of breath again.  I have set my new quit date of Sunday 24th of November and I'm back on here as of the 24th daily.   I noticed my friend jillar is still here as an administrator now, I no doubt will get all of the support I had before to quit again Kazza
Welcome back Kazza! Great to read that you are gonna get back on the train! The best gift you can give yourself if you ask me! Is there any (realistic) reason to delay this present? I mean.. why wait? The train is ready for you! The hardest weeks could be over on the 24th right? Let the Junky not be the one who decides!   That said, if you do decide to wait, that's cool too! Your quit so take your time to educate yourself - even if you think you know everything there is to know.. you need all hands on deck and all knowledge as leverage to overpower the addiction
@Kazza, Welcome back !  @Vivianne is right....why wait ?  Waiting enables anxiety and fear and a change of heart.    Decide to quit and quit.  Then read all you can, even if you think you already know about nicotine addiction.The information needs to be embedded in your brain, leaving NO room for relapse.   You can build yourself a strong and sturdy quit, put the work into your quit.  Invest in Yourself.  You deserve to be Free !
    Welcome Kazaa.      There are so many reasons to quit smoking and your health is a huge one.  Sazarac and Vivianne are right.  Why wait?  You need to quit as soon as possible.  There is plenty of support here to help you.
    Welcome back kazza, I'm sorry you lost your quit. I have to agree with the others that there's no time like the present to give yourself that present of quitting smoking. I know for myself that anytime I set a quit date the anxiety of actually going through with quitting was too much and I would just put it off.   My health was suffering too so I know how important it is for you to quit. So please stick close. You will get all the support you need here.   It's really good to 'see' you again 
    Welcome aboard .... Sorry you lit up again ....there is no such thing as ....just one ....  I agree with all those before me .. why wait ...junkie thinking ...why put more poison into your body ,just to get rid of it again .... You are amongst friends here...who will support you all the way in your journey ...
Welcome back - I totally understand picking a quit date - it gives you time to get ready - but it also just gives you more time to smoke - I originally was going to quit on November 15 - but I just decided one morning when I had only a smoke left to quit instead of buying any more and here I am - Has it been easy? nope - Have I wished I kept my original quit day? - Of course then I would still be smoking. All junkie thinking...     But whatever you decide we are here for you!!
Welcome back kazza!  I’m sorry to hear of your health troubles.  Get ready to get to work!! We are here to support you again every step of the way!         —L4L
    Welcome back to the QTrain, Kazza! Support is everything when you quit and you know you will find it here...take a seat and buckle in, it's going to get bumpy...but just for awhile! 
24th November is too much time and too much cigarettes .        Fight the demon soon and regain your health soon .      Stop worrying about unwanted health issues by smoking a lot of cigarettes       Fight the devil , Yes you can
The other day I went to the supermarked in the parking lot, opened my car door, and there was a complete whole cigarette in front of me. What should I do! I looked at it for quite a while, a bit too long I am thinking. I was kind of overjoyed to see it. What! I said to myself is this feeling for, it was like when I was down to my last cig and then found one which filled me with such happiness that I had discovered this find. So I guess this feeling of Joy still is hanging around, lurking in corners ready to surprise me. I realized this was serious, should I pick it up, or what!  No I didn't do any of those things, just kicked it away with my foot.     Leaves me thinking still: Old habits die hard, but its the feelings that take a while to go away too. After all over 7 months now and it seems those residue of feelings are still around yet. I am hoping its still the Joy of discovery that is still in me, and not the yearning.
    Sneaky devils they are and kudos to you for doing the right thing.  It just shows that we can never drop our guard. I think it was a positive experience for you in a testing sort of way.
@forestgreen    I just bumped this thread but, in case you miss it, have a lookHey-you-smoked-for-42-years-why-on-earth-would-you-think-you-can-get-past-the-addiction-in a couple of months, cut yourself some slack       Smoking changed our DNA and the addiction is with us forever.   All we can do is put it to sleep and stand guard over our quit. It is to be expected that associations and odd triggers will pop up, even over the course of our life.  These are never commands just reminders to hold fast to our commitment to NOPE (Not One Puff Ever)                   Edited November 6 by Sazerac

    and this from our friend, Joel Spitzer   
    Well done. Kick it to the kerb where it belongs.
Yea, I might have done that same thing as you forestgreen, it's normal. We smoked for a lot of years so even though seven months is awesome it's really just a drop in the bucket when compared to all those smoking years. Same with my almost 3 1/2 years. But each day we say NOPE makes us that much stronger

    When you educate yourself about the slavery to cigerettes.....and understand what a evil trap this addiction is     Its easier to discard the odd cigerette we find or lighter. You decided your quit was special and worth hanging on too.........well done ....
    Cigarette is a demon, It will enslave you for sure .    That nicotine smoke will cover your brain with only cigarette related thoughts .        Once you stop using it , your head will have more clarity       After throwing it away , you will be a better decision maker i think .      The cravings and conflicts keeps coming and going . But those sort of conflicts inside the head is always there for a normal human being .      So , throw the cigarettes away and deal with the conflicts .        There is always stress and strain in our everyday lives .       I don't think cigarettes can cure those stress and strain in anyway  
    Thank you so much everyone, for helping me to understand my own residue of emotions,  more importantly that I am not alone in wondering what the! .....in my mind. This experience only left me wondering, but my action made me feel a whole lot better. I guess I have to watch this side of me a bit more especially now that, the hurrying in shopping and driving has started in the Pre-Christmas rush. 
    It's not true joy you were feeling. It was the inner addict's voice, shouting for you to feed it. The inner addict felt joy. Not you. It really helps me to separate that part of myself. My inner addict wants a cigarette, but I don't. And I'm stronger. I'm gonna starve that ol' inner addict to death! You will, too. It takes a lot of time for that inner addict to really go dormant. (As we all know, it never really dies. It only takes one cigarette to bring it to life again.) Each time you face a trigger and don't smoke, your inner addict withers away a bit more.  Glad you kicked that cigarette to the curb!
    Hey thanks abbynormal, I am mostly always a joyful person, so it left me wondering should I give this feeling of joy over to the gutter with the cig, or do I hang onto the joyful bit, I am trying so hard to be happy with myself and others while I kick (pun) the habit.  I guess I will be standing guard and joyfully refrain.

Nicotine gangstered our brain receptors responsible for rewards (i.e. dopamine).    One by one we claim these receptors back.   It takes a while for the endorphins and dopamine to kick in.        This is why rewards are SO important, and why we recommend rewards for every crave/trigger and for every celebration.       I propose finding something beautiful to listen to or look at or remember when you are in a crave.  It will assist your brain to trigger endorphins/dopamine for Good things, for Clean things, for appropriate things  and wean itself away from the poison that is nicotine.
I agree about rewards, the only problem is  I used this method, by buying a cake at the supermarket, but now I am trying to loose weight, I will have to give myself something in reality, or think of something, straight away, which is hard to do when you are in the throse of remembering your previous reaction...Joyful could equal "glad that's over with" ,  buying a small item, around $3 which equals one cigarette and the price of a cake.  ??? ...I have already lost 2 kgms over 3 weeks. A bit slow but I think it will stick more for all of the time, and I ave been lucky enough to have done this before so my healthy eating is very good, except for cakes

The point is changing your thought to something good or just looking at something beautiful...that light on that leaf or the colour of that garment...something at hand.    Pick up a favourite book, give someone a hug, put a talisman in your pocket.        Even faking a smile encourages endorphins...and soon the smile becomes very, very real.     I also put the ducats for the cost of a pack of smokes every day in a big mason jar.  The dosh added up quickly and I could take it out and count it like King Midas.   This was a huge motivator for me.
    The thing is rewards were cake or ice cream now I am loosing weight. Need to buy something else that is real or think of something else to make me smile.
    How about a nice smelling candle ,now that your nose is coming back to life .......lovely ...    
    That sounds lovely. Will do that one thanks Doreensfree
ORIGINALLY BY OBOB-GOLD FREEDOM MEMBER-WHYQUIT.COM So, I start reminiscing a bit about the early days of my quit. I remember members popping in to post their celebration threads. Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold and beyond. It felt downright intimidating. Here was I, with my seemingly tiny little insignificant sum of 3 days, 4 days, 5 days and so on... clinging to my quit like a man clinging to a life line thrown over the side of a ship to a man overboard in a turbulent sea. More comfortable ex-smokers would roll past on their skiff, yachts and cruiseliners, each with the same advice. Keep climbing that rope. Don't let go of it. It'll get easier. We promise. To me, those people seemed like heroes. From my perspective, they were superhuman, with this gift of comfort I couldn't hardly imagine at that point. I dreamed of being like them some day, but it seemed hard to fathom that this splintery rope would really get me there. It was hard, and I was tired. But, I really wanted to be like those amazing people, and everyone of them told me the same thing… keep climbing, don't let go. Simple. A real slog, but simple. So, I took their advice, kept climbing and didn't let go. Lo and behold, it was true. It did, in fact, get easier, and easier. There was the odd bit of rope burn, and occasionally a seagull would take aim at my dome with an unwelcome gift (nobody takes a metaphor to the extremes I will), but all-in-all, it got more and more doable, less and less of a chore, and at some point, almost without noticing it, I found myself reclining on the Lido Deck with the others. That was years ago now. I've been kicking back up here for a good long time now, and I can tell you it's very nice. So, what's my point? My point is to you, the newcomer. Down there on the rope. Yeah, you. You're looking up at me (and the others who have so much time under their belts), and thinking, "man, that guy's almost surreal. Maybe he's got something I don't. How in the world did he get up there? Surely, he didn't take this blasted rope?! He must have some secret that I don't. He's gotta have supernatural powers to have such comfort." My point to you is this: Every one of us up here got here the same way. We took the rope. We climbed it. We didn't let go. And, just like we were told, it got easier. You will also get here that way. Three years ago, I was where you are. Everyone here has been there at one time. We understand what you're going through. Nobody here is a superhero. We're just addicts like you who found the rope earlier. And, we can each promise you… the rope is climbable, it does get easier, and there IS a place for you up here. There's one other way in which we're similar. Neither of us have wings. We let go the rope, or step off the side, we all plummet to the abyss the same way. One puff and it's all history. I learned that on my way up too. People who'd seemed almost unreal they were so comfortable, for no reason that I could understand, suddenly got up from their comfortable seats, walked to the side of the deck, and threw themselves off. Breaking the metaphor, so that it's perfectly clear, they took a puff and lost their freedom. Some of these were members who had been very active in supporting others, and had experienced months and even years of sustained comfort. One day, for their own reasons, they decided to chance it, and lo and behold their comfort was gone. They returned to their old levels of smoking, often more. I know this is true from email, and from the time when Freedom's policies were different and relapsed members were allowed to rejoin. All it took was one puff, and it was over. So, while it may be tempting to look at some of the longer term quitters with awe, consider that we are, and always will be subject to the same rules you are. One puff = all puffs. If I were to slip down to the pub right now, walk up to a friend, and take a drag off of his cigarette, I know full well that I would be out on my deck tomorrow night with a pack and an ash tray putting memories of Freedom and this post and everything I've given myself over the past 3 years in a deep hidden locker that my junky side would work overtime to prevent me from opening. Why is it important to point out that, with respect to nicotine addiction, you and I are the same, just separated by a bit of time? I guess because it's tempting for a new quitter to allow himself or herself to believe that all of these people dispensing education and encouragement here, couldn't possibly understand what they're going through. It may be tempting to listen to your own junky mind telling you, "You're different. These people aren't like you. They don't understand what you're experiencing. You know that you'll never be able to be like them. It's impossible for you." My long-winded, metaphorically-extreme point is to tell you that that's bunk. While you are different from me in many ways, our addiction to nicotine is the same. You will find comfort (emphasis on WILL) just as I and every other long-term member of Freedom did (by never taking another puff), and you WILL maintain that comfort the same way we all must (by never taking another puff).The factor that really shows the addiction is not how hard or how easy it is to quit. What really shows the addiction is how universally easy it is to go back. One puff and the quit can go out the window.
Hi Nancy, I missed this last night- had already turned off the computer.  I love this it is so true.  Thanks for posting. :)
This is one of my favorite posts Nancy! Thank you! 
I often wondered where "climbing the rope" came from I love it, definitely a great way to describe our journey x

I guess because it's tempting for a new quitter to allow himself or herself to believe that all of these people dispensing education and encouragement here, couldn't possibly understand what they're going through. It may be tempting to listen to your own junky mind telling you, "You're different. These people aren't like you. They don't understand what you're experiencing. You know that you'll never be able to be like them. It's impossible for you."  My long-winded, metaphorically-extreme point is to tell you that that's bunk. While you are different from me in many ways, our addiction to nicotine is the same. You will find comfort (emphasis on WILL) just as I and every other long-term member of Freedom did (by never taking another puff), and you WILL maintain that comfort the same way we all must (by never taking another puff).The factor that really shows the addiction is not how hard or how easy it is to quit. What really shows the addiction is how universally easy it is to go back. One puff and the quit can go out the window. robg Thank you for bumping it again Nancy this is a great one.

Thank you! Excellent post. I am conufused by this line: "I know this is true from email, and from the time when Freedom's policies were different and relapsed members were allowed to rejoin" Are we not welcome back if we relapse?
Thank you! Excellent post. I am conufused by this line: "I know this is true from email, and from the time when Freedom's policies were different and relapsed members were allowed to rejoin" Are we not welcome back if we relapse? I believe this is in reference to a different online Quit Smoking group.  Many of our seasoned QT'rs started off on another site; some are still members there and some are not.

I did see some support groups that do not allow relapse or any use of nicotine replacement usage they seemed a bit extreme but signed up for one of those sites as well. The more support the better :-)

Hey, you smoked for 42 years! Why on earth would you think you can get past the addiction in a couple of months? Cut yourself a break, for Pete's sake. The physical dependence ends rather quickly but the mental side of the addiction is how we beat it or why we relapse. All of the things that cause triggers after nicotine has left your body are mostly mental.  They can be memories, smells, a particular song, a ritual like smoking after dinner or with morning coffee, the first snowfall and the list can go on and on. It's going to take an entire year to experience the full cycle of life without smoking.  For some the triggers are few and far between while for others they're daily. What were some of things that caused you triggers early on and how often do you get them now and what are they?  One thing we know for sure is that the longer you stay quit, the less frequent they become until you can't even picture yourself smoking. It doesn't matter if your 1 week quit or 5 years.  Please share your experiences, past and present regarding triggers because with that comes hope and confidence for those who are struggling on their journey of their first full year without smoking.
For me -  The rituals. First smoke in the morning, after eating..those were the toughest craves initially. I changed routines up and focused on understanding the nature of triggers - understanding that all habits can be changed - and that the only thing causing a desire for the next cigarette was the previous cigarette. Then - I found myself hankering for a cigarette when the Spring came..again, analysing where the trigger came from, why, helped me overcome them. Even now - 9 months quit - I get the odd trigger. Sometimes a strong one. But I'm experienced now - I ignore it - and surprise surprise, it goes away.
.
Agree with all the above,.. for me a big trigger (habit) was talking on the phone, I reached for a cig before I answered the phone, lit one before I made a call, then chain smoked the entire time I talked... it was one of the hardest for me to get passed, I tried lollipops, Twizzlers, cinnamon toothpicks,pacing back and forth... but what worked for me was twirling  my hair with my free hand.. don't know why it works for me, and I really don't care why it works ( I still do it ).. it works and thats all that matters... goes to show - it's important  to keep trying things until you find one that works for you and your particular  smoking related trigger / habit... 
When I first quit, after the all the time cravings ended, I had alot of triggers such as the after work cig . They faded one by one. One of the most lingering was the first cig in the morning. Now I get some thoughts when driving in the car or when thinking about,strangely, fun times, such as vacation or a night out with friends. I do not think about smoking when stressed. I get wistful, as if smoking was ansign of youth, or freedom. I do this too with other substances. So, these are thoughts, not cravings. I dismiss these by imagining the death smoke filling my lungs, reversing the healing, and the disappointment of my family, friends and me.
Once in a blue moon a trigger escapes.  It's like nothing to deal with now though.  Like flicking a bug off your shoulder.  Every time you face down a trigger in the beginning, it builds up your strength.  Each trigger from then on out will become easier and easier to deal with.  Guaranteed :)
Once you convince your brian that you are finally ready to quit Nicotine for good, the triggers will fade away or just become an after thought. It really is like that one nut farmer always says whether we like hearing it or not " Easy Peasy "  Smile And Embrace The Quit  :)
Easy peasy.  Oh how I loathed those words. But I understand now.  Stick with it, and anyone can.
I had been putting a drug in my body for 52years at least,20 times a day....I knew my quit was not going to be a walk in the park...I didn't know how to live with out it....Everything I did reminded me of the dam things...I read Allen Carr....I read everything I could on the subject...I searched the Internet....In the end ..I felt like Rambo....ready and armed.....I fought the craves with all my knowledge....some were easy....some not so.....I can still get a crave....a thought....but know that's all it is....Somewhere deep in my memory....I had a life where smoking meant more to me than anything....Now...anything is more important than a smoke....There is only one way.....n.o.p.e.......
I had smoked for so many years I didn't think I could quit as I had so many things that would trigger me to want a smoke. It has been a while since I've had a trigger but in the beginning everything was a trigger. A smoke first thing in the morning was a must!Whenever I was on the phone, another huge trigger.Every time I got in the car I would light up.After meals was automatically smoke time!Any little job I finished reward time was a smoke.That is just a few of my triggers. I figure for the rest of my life there will be a trigger when I least expect it to crop up but they are now very few and far between and just a fleeting moment! Just have to remember NOPE!!!!
Yep same as Fay^^^^^^^^^ and alcohol and cig went hand in hand,Don't miss a single one of them except when I am ossified (drunk) and out with smokers, that is literally the only trigger I ever get, once in a blue moon,  well because I rarely get out lol
Q.  Why on earth would you think you can get past the addiction in a couple of months? A.  Because,  I am a Nicotine Addict and Denial has been my Comfort.
I have to say that Saturday cleaning for some reason gives me a craving.  I guess I used it as a reward to take a break from the cleaning, so after each room I would go outside and have a smoke before continuing on.  I still get one or two craves on Saturday now, but not nearly as strong or intense as they used to be.  Now its just all of a sudden and I think "wow, that was weird" and ignore it. I guess everything I did was based around smoking and cigarettes now that I think about it.  Cigarette in the morning with my coffee, on the way to work, during break times, drive home, and then whenever I felt like it at home.  One of the biggest triggers for me was the telephone.  Anytime the phone rang and it was for me, I'd grab my pack of cigarettes and lighter and head outside.  It was like a huge trigger.  I did avoid talking on the phone too much in the beginning, but I actually got used to it pretty quick.  Then of course right  before going to bed I'd have my last one for the day. Most typical things also were triggers for me; stress, need to ponder on an issue, or a problem, or because I just had a heated arguement with my spouse, child, or friend.  Really I'd find any reason, but those were also triggers. When I decided to quit smoking, I knew this time I had to be diligent and not a coward when it came to putting down the pack.  I picked a date that was in the near future and continued to smoke until then.  We were going on a big vacation with our grown daughters so I did not want to put that kind of stress on myself during a relaxing fun time.  I had said I would quit the first weekend after we returned home.  That Friday evening I smoked my last cigarette before going to bed.  I almost forgot in the morning and began looking for my pack of cigarettes only to realize that "oh yeah, I quit".  I was scared at that moment, but I made a commitment and I was going to stick to it.   So here I am going on 6 months later and glad I stuck with that commitment and decision.  I have no regrets of quitting and I do not miss it at all.  I have gained a few pounds, but am at the point of now I need to lose those pounds because I don't like how I feel in my own skin.   I noticed that my younger sister is using an e-cig and hoping she chooses to quit with it.   Even my best friend told me she was thinking about getting one, so maybe she will finally quit smoking as well.  If I was the inspiration for that, it makes me even more proud that I quit.
NayNay - you may be La Bandita's sister. The cleaning one was huge for her. A real surprise one for me is the hangover - if I over-indulge in alcohol (perish the thought!) the following morning - as well as feeling a bit rough - I get a trigger. Strange.
The only trigger that I still get frequently is if I am working on a challenging project...I will get a urge to walk outside and smoke and then come back to it.  I have learned that it is the walk outside that helps...not the smoke!
I remember as a "newbie" wanting to quickly get to that "happy" part of being cig free but for 2 yrs I kept shooting myself in the foot throwing away quits, especially after going almost 11 months. But yes EVERYONE  hates the beginning of their quits BUT to me by it being painful it will help you to never want to repeat the process.
This is true Beth.....guard your quit.....It could take years before your ready to try again.....mmmmmAt my age ...not a good idea.....much better to keep the quit....than to regret I threw it away....for nothing....Xxxxx
I can get past the addiction when I remember how much smoking sucks.  I'd rather not smoke than smoke.  That is really what it is.  I hate smoking.  Seriously, why do I want to do that?????  NO GOOD REASON!!!    Occasionally, I still get very strong cravings, but they are so much easier to overcome now - a mere NOPE really.  But at totally random times, the super strong feeling strikes and God, all I wish is that I could have a smoke.  At those moments, I have to remind myself of why I quit.  I have a list I keep one my phone that I refer to on those occasions.  After being quit for even a short time, it really is easy to overcome those cravings, but I won't deny that those feelings are still there - dumb addiction!    
In the beginning I experienced the ritual triggers.  First smoke in the evening, after meals and last one before bed.  It def took time to overcome those.  I had to create new rituals and eventually I stopped having those triggers. On occasion I still get a reminder that I used to smoke when I am stressed. I think it helps to live your life, triggers and all, right from the start.  Delaying the triggers just postpones a part of the process that is a must at some point for a successful quit.  You need to live your life without smoking just like you lived your life as a smoker.  Eventually, you break the associations.
I did discover over this past weekend that a usual trigger for me was always when I was upset or aggitated, or after a disagreement with my spouse or one of my daughters.  My youngest daughter upset me quite a bit Friday evening, and instead of grabbing a cigarette and going outside to get away from the arguement, I realized that now I just head to a different room away from the fight and busy myself with something to keep my mind occupied.  I also may go off to cry alone, but this past Friday evening I went to my "Zen" room and straightened out a few drawers on my vanity that were in a bit of disarray.  So, if every time I get upset about something, I now go off and keep my mind and hands busy with some type of cleaning or clearing out activity.  If this keeps up, I'll have gone through my whole house and everything will be so organized I'll drive myself crazy!   :P  :huh:  :rolleyes:  :wacko:  :blink:
    Please join in the discussion 
I have no idea how long I will be either physically, psychologically or habitually dealing with this addiction. All I think about is today...not smoking today and then getting off the nicotine in a month or two, depending on how I adjust to each step down.        But even after having quit for a year and half , 30 years ago I know my nicotine thinking can still get to me IF i forget. I had quit while I was pregnant and breastfeeding. The day I stopped breastfeeding I rewarded myself with ONE cigarette. Bought a pack, took ONE out and threw the rest away. That was it for me. In a month's time I was back to a pack a day. I had also quit for over a year about 10 years ago.      For me, I see that I will always have to be diligent and first thing every morning say NOPE for the rest of my life. While the urges may not be as frequent or hardly at all a year from now, I am an ADDICT. After my past two quit experiences, for me, it always tries and find a way back in to my life because I think I have beat it.         I know people who have quit and eventually get to a place they never want to have a cig again. If I am one of them on this quit...good. if I get urges the rest of my life and i have to say NOPE every morning for the rest of my life...good. as long as I don't ever have smoke a cigarette and I am  free, whatever works for me.       But for now, I will not smoke TODAY.Edited May 6, 2018 by lml
I am at 7 months and so far the only real bad time was exactly three months in. I was rummaging through some old magazines and of course every other page is a cigarette ad.        I would love to smoke really but probably best to avoid that bad habit
    For me cigarettes were a company in solitude. I have recently moved to another country and immediately it triggered a thought “now you’re on your own, sit and enjoy the cigarette”. I’ve been smoke-free for exactly six months and this quit has been relatively calm, so those thoughts were unexpected. But I’m glad I’ve beaten another scheme, will be stronger in case there’s some forgotten, hidden trigger lurking and waiting for its moment.

Why would you love to smoke after you quit and,  I assume,  educated yourself about addiction ?     Why would you love to smoke ?
Sazerac - because my nerves are a mess without them. I am easily annoyed by stuff and also was before i started smoking.        brand new ela - Sometimes weird triggers do pop up. Thje best defense we have of course is to not have cigarettes handy. Or just we gotta tell ourselves "no". I went to get gas today and they had smokes for $3.50 (normally close to $6) I looked but then just thought, "No, isn't worth throwing out my quit. Besides, they will go back up soon as i am re-hooked".       I do not really associate with any smokers so avoiding the temptation when around them - I have no advice.Edited May 6, 2018 by Jetblack

There are better ways to deal with your nerves than romanticizing any relief you think smoking will provide.    That ain''t getting you anywhere, it's just keeping yourself tied to smokes.        I know the idea of intensive concentrated breathing , meditation, sometimes sounds cliche   but, it is the best thing on the planet to deal with nerves, annoyances, anger, fear, craziness, idiocy.    Ask me ! I've used meditation successfully  for all those things and I'm here to tell you, when you get serious...it friggin works.
    For me my triggers were stress and boredom. I have learned though over the past year I can deal with stress and I can find something to do when bored. Not everyday is easy but much easier than in the beginning. It short it's so true it does get easier, it may seem like it never will but it does, just hang on the ride will slow down.
    In the beginning everything was a trigger. Now it's seems to be when I do something new.        I like the message of this post. I need to have patience with myself. I mean I think I've been quit for a while so I should feel good and not want to smoke. I don't think about smoking often but sometimes do have a thought to smoke. I think about how horrid withdrawal is and how I don't want to go through it again. It seems to help when I have a flippant thought of having "just one".
I'm approaching 3 years. The first months were hard. I fell into a depression and had a lot of anxiety. At first, the morning, after meal, and cigarettes to take a 'break' from whatever I was doing were the hardest to let go of. Now I don't have those triggers but still occasionally think about smoking when I am bored. I had to believe that I really could quit for good after so many failures. Participating on a forum made all the difference for me.

This takes some time but, it happens if you learn and understand.    Study till your eyes bleed if that's what it takes.    Don't allow it to take up space in your precious brains.  Save romance for ROMANCE.     Spring is here,  go fall in love again.  Go encourage a crush or something.     Nicotine is a fierce opponent but powerless when you understand how it worms it's way into your consciousness.  Addiction makes you lie to yourself.  Addiction is completely self serving. I understand that it takes time not only to identify it's hold over us but, to mercilessly weed it out.     But, you need to be the aggressor here and squelch any idolized version of smoking.     There is no use for addiction, no reason to woo addiction.  Smoking is not romance, it is not glam or fun.  That is just junkie talk. Stop Listening.  The junkie wants to kill you fgs, and keep you enslaved. What kind of life is that ?  What kind of death will that be?   Nicotine addiction is a burden and Smoking, however romantically applied,   may provide you a long,  gruesome and painful death, that is if you are lucky enough to die early.  Otherwise you get to linger..in horror of yourself and a horror to your family, to your carers.     A complete Horror show, ask Doreen, ask others how romantic it is.      I'm sorry for the rant. Please,  take what you need and leave the rest. This romance siht is holding you back, making it harder on yourself.    Be merciless and rip out all the roots of smokey romance    and give yourself a hug from me.

Giving up tobacco then diving into a relationship (that probably won't work) is called "out of the frying pan and into the fire".        For Travellingsunny - the desire to smoke does decrease over time. Not sure how long til it is gone gone but it does decrease, I assume you have noticed it. I do not think we can stop them from trying to creep in any more than we could stop thought of sex when we were younger.

Perhaps I AM being aggressive.. because I recognize the junkie thinking for what it is (most of the time) and make it a point to remind my silly self that those are NOT my thoughts, and then try to distract myself so I'm not listening to them.     Put in that context, I suppose I'm actually a lot tougher than I was giving myself credit for.

You say NO,  as in N  O..   That is all you can do, just say NO and commit to NOPE a zillion times a day.       Your job is to root out the romantic thoughts that addiction has planted in your brain, root out your junkie thoughts because they don't serve you anymore. You Don't Smoke.    Stand up straight and realize,  you don't smoke.    End of discussion.
Well not just smoking but any form of tobacco is bad. The worst is chew. I mean it is gross and vile and BLEH.  EDIT - I use NO tobacco but have chewed before. It is horrendous. Like putting a piece of poop in your lip      But as we know, unless your name is Keith Richards, you cannot just poison your body for years and expect to live long. How the hell do some people survive like that?      If you are struggling to KTQ -  You think you got it rough, imagine being that guy and trying to quit. He just couldn't at this point. I mean it just could not happen no matter what.  YOU, on the other hand, have a chance still.        For Sunny - You are handling this. Yes, stand like a marine and realize you can beat the cigarettes. Giving up the quit - Stephen Hawking certainly would not stand for it. Ok that was a BAD joke but yeah, hang in there.Edited May 7, 2018 by Jetblack

    Romancing the cancer stick ...!! I want just one !!!!.  Read some more...you need to know exactly what you are missing  ????.......you are missing nothing...you are gaining everything...  I was that terrified the day I quit...the only thing that bothered me was...will I fail again....   I knew this quit was different...I never romanced a smoke at all...welll...when your faced with amputation or a smoke...I chose my plates of meat ( feet )..... I know not everyone has...they have lost limbs.... This is the true nature of this addiction... It takes away reality....   The reality is..this is one hell of a addiction that is maming and killing millions...  Once you had read and watched all the stuff..you have it  in your mind..you are making the correct decision to rid yourself....you will be comfortable in your quit...  Embrace being free...   PS...if anyone is not quit sure how living with emphysema will effect your life..I would be more than happy to enlighten you...

On 11/2/2014 at 4:03 AM, MarylandQuitter said:  Hey, you smoked for 42 years! Why on earth would you think you can get past the addiction in a couple of months? Cut yourself a break, for Pete's sake.                             The physical dependence ends rather quickly but the mental side of the addiction is how we beat it or why we relapse.                                       All of the things that cause triggers after nicotine has left your body are mostly mental.  They can be memories, smells, a particular song, a ritual like smoking after dinner or with morning coffee, the first snowfall and the list can go on and on.                                       It's going to take an entire year to experience the full cycle of life without smoking.  For some the triggers are few and far between while for others they're daily.                                      What were some of things that caused you triggers early on and how often do you get them now and what are they?  One thing we know for sure is that the longer you stay quit, the less frequent they become until you can't even picture yourself smoking.                                      It doesn't matter if your 1 week quit or 5 years.  Please share your experiences, past and present regarding triggers because with that comes hope and confidence for those who are struggling on their journey of their first full year without smoking.               bump
    There was always a lot of family drama in my life and dealing with the dysfunction could lead to many moments of chain smoking.  I always thought that, if I was the better person, I could change things.  I thought I was relieving  my stress by smoking but I was actually just being self destructive.  By facing those triggers,  I learned that the only responsibility I had was to myself and my happiness.  Quitting has finally given me the power to take back the control over my own life.  
I knew going into this quit that the mental/emotional side of my addiction was what my issue was and recent posts by another member made me really open that up and look at it. I know there will be others out there who won't get this and will think I'm off with the fairies or have a few roos loose in my top paddock but this is why a quit can be so different from person a to person b to person c... for some of us smoking has just as much to do with nicotine addiction as it has to do with filling an emotional and psychological void. Right so I know some of you are just itching to fire off and rebut the shit out of this but please just read it first then have at it. I'm just sharing my perspective and it might give some of you an insight into some of the more challenging personalities here.   So my first smoke was the night my grandad died of emphysema and I was legally an adult adult at the time so shoulda known better. Confession: I've kinda always liked the smell of smokes, right from when I was a kid...because that smell meant my grandad was around, or my aunty and it meant I was safe. So right from the get go that smell meant safety, and warmth, and love and acceptance...so mentally, long before I smoked, I was building associations with smoking that it was part of being safe, and loved, and protected.  I know this is bull, and most of those voids are now scars. I mean come on, smoke was never going to fill anything for more than a moment. But you see I could control smoking, it was never going to abandon me, or kick me out, or shut me out, it sure as shit wasn't gunna reject me...it was the safest  (  ) relationship I had. It made me feel good and wanted and needed. It was never going to take that away from me I could reject it IF I WANTED to...but it was never going to reject me or find me wanting or lacking.     So @hesteralumni23 sweetie, if you're still lurking this post is for you and all the other smokers who have given it an emotional value it doesn't deserve .. see HA23 had a sucky childhood too... Her mum died when she was young (abandonment)...she was the thrown into an unstable and abusive home life (massive list) so here she is trying to navigate the chaos that is her new home life and stay safe, grieve her mum, puberty, her sexuality and then along comes an abusive older girl who takes advantage of a confused, scared, lonely little girl and because she is so starved for love and affection she associates those feelings with smoking because after her abuser (no offence but no 18yo old, male or female, should be anywhere sexually near a 13yo....at that age 5 year gap is huge....5 years down the track not as much) made her feel loved, and touched tenderly, and wanted they smoked... So to feel those things again, she would smoke....it filled the void...and unlike her abuser who would vanish to the other side of the country or her mum who would die the ciggies were never going to abandon her... She controlled that ..they were always going to be there...I get it, because the story might be different but that's me. It's stupid, junky thinking....and where is this all going...right, it's all Bull!... But when your addiction is tied up into such an emotional need you kind of have to deal with that shit as well as all the other quit stuff. So .... Doesn't mean you can't quit you can, I did... It just means the journey is different.   1. Deal with the emotional voids.   2. Realise that your nicotine addiction feeds all those bad thoughts you have about yourself, those nicotine receptors play on all your insecurities and exploit them so that you will have a smoke "to feel better"....smoking does nothing to improve your worth and it certainly doesn't love you.   3. Learn about how nicotine addiction works, how it changes your brain. 4. Love yourself enough to stop the cycle of self abuse.    So for all of us it is as simple as committing to the decision to not put something in our mouth and smoking it...but for some of us that includes stripping down the why, looking at it and rebuilding into the person we should be.

This takes some time but, it happens if you learn and understand.    Study till your eyes bleed if that's what it takes.                    Don't allow it to take up space in your precious brains.  Save romance for ROMANCE.                     Spring is here,  go fall in love again.  Go encourage a crush or something.                                     Nicotine is a fierce opponent but powerless when you understand how it worms it's way into your consciousness.                  Addiction makes you lie to yourself.  Addiction is completely self serving.                 I understand that it takes time not only to identify it's hold over us but, to mercilessly weed it out.                     But, you need to be the aggressor here and squelch any idolized version of smoking.                                     There is no use for addiction, no reason to woo addiction.                  Smoking is not romance, it is not glam or fun.  That is just junkie talk. Stop Listening.  The junkie wants to kill you fgs, and keep you enslaved.                 What kind of life is that ?  What kind of death will that be?                   Nicotine addiction is a burden and Smoking, however romantically applied,                   may provide you a long,  gruesome and painful death, that is if you are lucky enough to die early.                  Otherwise you get to linger..in horror of yourself and a horror to your family, to your carers.                     A complete Horror show, ask Doreen, ask others how romantic it is.                                      I'm sorry for the rant.                 Please,  take what you need and leave the rest.                 This romance siht is holding you back, making it harder on yourself.                    Be merciless and rip out all the roots of smokey romance                    and give yourself a hug from me.            This is just what the Dr. order..... I needed to see this today !!!!
    Hey @QueenB,        These links may well help you, too   Red Flags   Nicodemons Lies        and a keeper list of our friend, Joel Spitzer's, videos,  Use Rationalization Videos        You are building a sturdy, successful quit Queen B !    Hold fast to your NOPE and protect your precious quit.
As a smoker for 38 years I appreciate this thread because I struggle and struggle and relapse and relapse, then find myself wondering why others are able to stay quit and why I give in to the junkie thinking and make the choice to smoke again ("just one last pack because ABC") over and over and over again, fully aware of what I'm doing but "feeling" powerless to stop (note I am aware I'm "feeling" powerless, not truly powerless in reality) Please don't read into this post as giving myself an excuse to relapse. Thats not what I mean. I mean, I am trying not to kick myself in the head everytime I relapse, but to stay aware of the fact that when you smoke for as long as some of us have smoked, its going to be hard, its going to be tough and instead of hating on ourselves and criticizing ourselves (that will lead to giving up trying) its better to acknowledge that its going to continue to be hard and that its time to try something different...take suggestions...try new things to avoid giving in. I need to shake up this quit. I'm tired of coming in here with a new quit over and over again. Its embarrassing and humbling for sure.
    YES!!!! @Sazerac Building up my knowledge and whatever else as my ammunition to fight this crazy addiction!!!!LOL   I say it like that because it has snuck up behind me when I least expected it and I had to fight for my life (not literally) but everything was on the line and I had to go in my bag of goody's (everything I learned here!) and fight that addiction like a soldier in war!!!!! Needless to say the addiction lost and I WON!!!!! To all my fellow ASHKICKERS;  keep fighting the good fight!! It is SO WORTH IT
@QueenB, you are young in your quit and must treat it as a priceless jewel.  Protect it with your life.     All sorts of craves and triggers will appear during your first year, that is just the way it is.    Be prepared, some will pop in out of the blue.      Every receptor in your brain will fire off, one at a time, screaming 'gimme a smoke !'  When you change up your response and replace this scream with a reward instead of a smoke, you WIN. You reclaim your brain and that receptor will no longer rely on nicotine.   It's pretty cool how our brain will heal itself.        This is why rewards are so important.   Your receptors are used to nicotine signalling a reward of dopamine,    soon they will give you a reward for looking at beauty or listening to music or dancing around, so happy to be nicotine free.       You are doing great ! Continue educating yourself...knowledge is power.

I smoked 52 years...it wasn't easy at first ...but I stuck to the rule ...  Day by day...Hour by Hour...or minute by minute ...
    Smoking sucks!  Being a nonsmoker is awesome!   Are you willing to fight to make the transition?

How do you feel about a friend who has to go everywhere with you? Not only does he tag along all the time, but since he is so offensive and vulgar, you become unwelcome when with him. He has a peculiar odor that sticks to you wherever you go. Others think both of you stink.  He controls you totally. When he says jump, you jump. Sometimes in the middle of a blizzard or storm, he wants you to come to the store and pick him up. You would give your spouse hell if he or she did that to you all the time, but you can't argue with your friend. Sometimes, when you are out at a movie or play he says he wants you to go stand in the lobby with him and miss important scenes. Since he calls all the shots in your life, you go. Your friend doesn't like your choice of clothing either. Instead of politely telling you that you have lousy taste, he burns little holes in these items so you will want to throw them out. Sometimes, he tires of the furniture and gets rid of it too. Occasionally, he gets really nasty and decides the whole house must go. He gets pretty expensive to support. Not only is his knack of property destruction costly, but you must pay to keep him with you. In fact, he will cost you thousands of dollars over your lifetime. And you can count on one thing, he will never pay you a penny in return. Often at picnics you watch others playing vigorous activities and having lots of fun doing them. But your friend won't let you. He doesn't believe in physical activity. In his opinion, you are too old to have that kind of fun. So he kind of sits on your chest and makes it difficult for you to breathe. Now you don't want to go off and play with other people when you can't breathe, do you? Your friend does not believe in being healthy. He is really repulsed by the thought of you living a long and productive life. So every chance he gets he makes you sick. He helps you catch colds and flu. Not just by running out in the middle of the lousy weather to pick him up at the store. He is more creative than that. He carries thousands of poisons with him which he constantly blows in your face. When you inhale some of them, they wipe out cilia in your lungs which would have helped you prevent these diseases. But colds and flu are just his form of child's play. He especially likes diseases that slowly cripple you - like emphysema. He considers this disease great. Once he gets you to have this, you will give up all your other friends, family, career goals, activities - everything. You will just sit home and caress him, telling him what a great friend he is while you desperately gasp for air. But eventually your friend tires of you. He decides he no longer wishes to have your company. Instead of letting you go your separate ways, he decides to kill you. He has a wonderful arsenal of weapons behind him. In fact, he has been plotting your death since the day you met him. He picked all the top killers in society and did everything in his power to ensure you would get one of them. He overworked your heart and lungs. He clogged up the arteries to your heart, brain, and every other part of your body. In case you were too strong to succumb to this, he constantly exposed you to cancer causing agents. He knew he would get you sooner or later. Well, this is the story of your "friend," your cigarette. No real friend would do all this to you. Cigarettes are the worst possible enemies you ever had. They are expensive, addictive, socially unacceptable, and deadly. Consider all this and NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF! Joel http://whyquit.com/whyquit/joelcigfriend.html
Friends Eh?
Don't make it your friend but it should be enemy so that it will become easy for you to make it away.

On ‎11‎/‎1‎/‎2014 at 9:05 PM, MarylandQuitter said:             How do you feel about a friend who has to go everywhere with you? Not only does he tag along all the time, but since he is so offensive and vulgar, you become unwelcome when with him. He has a peculiar odor that sticks to you wherever you go. Others think both of you stink.                                                                                  He controls you totally. When he says jump, you jump. Sometimes in the middle of a blizzard or storm, he wants you to come to the store and pick him up. You would give your spouse hell if he or she did that to you all the time, but you can't argue with your friend. Sometimes, when you are out at a movie or play he says he wants you to go stand in the lobby with him and miss important scenes. Since he calls all the shots in your life, you go. Your friend doesn't like your choice of clothing either. Instead of politely telling you that you have lousy taste, he burns little holes in these items so you will want to throw them out. Sometimes, he tires of the furniture and gets rid of it too. Occasionally, he gets really nasty and decides the whole house must go.                                                     He gets pretty expensive to support. Not only is his knack of property destruction costly, but you must pay to keep him with you. In fact, he will cost you thousands of dollars over your lifetime. And you can count on one thing, he will never pay you a penny in return.                                                       Often at picnics you watch others playing vigorous activities and having lots of fun doing them. But your friend won't let you. He doesn't believe in physical activity. In his opinion, you are too old to have that kind of fun. So he kind of sits on your chest and makes it difficult for you to breathe. Now you don't want to go off and play with other people when you can't breathe, do you?                                                      Your friend does not believe in being healthy. He is really repulsed by the thought of you living a long and productive life. So every chance he gets he makes you sick. He helps you catch colds and flu. Not just by running out in the middle of the lousy weather to pick him up at the store. He is more creative than that. He carries thousands of poisons with him which he constantly blows in your face. When you inhale some of them, they wipe out cilia in your lungs which would have helped you prevent these diseases.                                                      But colds and flu are just his form of child's play. He especially likes diseases that slowly cripple you - like emphysema. He considers this disease great. Once he gets you to have this, you will give up all your other friends, family, career goals, activities - everything. You will just sit home and caress him, telling him what a great friend he is while you desperately gasp for air.                                                        But eventually your friend tires of you. He decides he no longer wishes to have your company. Instead of letting you go your separate ways, he decides to kill you. He has a wonderful arsenal of weapons behind him. In fact, he has been plotting your death since the day you met him. He picked all the top killers in society and did everything in his power to ensure you would get one of them. He overworked your heart and lungs. He clogged up the arteries to your heart, brain, and every other part of your body. In case you were too strong to succumb to this, he constantly exposed you to cancer causing agents. He knew he would get you sooner or later.                                                       Well, this is the story of your "friend," your cigarette. No real friend would do all this to you. Cigarettes are the worst possible enemies you ever had. They are expensive, addictive, socially unacceptable, and deadly. Consider all this and NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!

    Oh shit, how long this list is. It hit me straight in the face. I contain more chemicals than a pharmacy. Horrifying. 
    Add to this hundreds of more compounds created by lighting the cigarette.   We were freebasing an astronomical amount of poison. 
Does it really matter what is in a cigarette?   Is someone going to say, "Oh no, I had no idea about all the chemicals". If there ARE that many different chemicals, how many of any single one would there be? Have you actually looked through this list? It looks like water, sugar, coffee, cocoa, and maple syrup are on there. And that is just skimming that list.       OK, is it the REAL maple syrup that costs $10 a pint or the fake stuff like Aunt Jemima?        A lot of that stuff is everyday food ingredients.       So I guess the main point is -  Why is actual maple syrup sold in glass containers but the fake stuff is in plastic bottles?    Also, since i eat a ton of sugar and drink a lot of water and cocoa, does that mean I relapsed?
I don't know the technical name but I remember being told once that cigarettes contain bronchodilators (?).  It helps your airways open up when you inhale so you don't cough.      When I used to have a cough I swore that smoking helped me. Maybe it wasn't complete BS if the bronchodilator thing is true. Edited to say I'm not saying it's a good thing!!       It's weird because I read every single ingredient on everything I use but never ever thought about it when I smoked. I wonder why the ingredients aren't listed on packs. Apart from the fact the pack would need to be the size of a shoe box. Edited March 8 by Lilly
Lets just look at just one ingredient... cocoa... why would they add that... 2 reasons... it is improves the flavour and its broncheodilator. .... Because when cocoa burns it undergoes a chemical change not just a physical change the chemicals released from it are toxic... in high enough doses...       So the nae sayers are right, if all of these chemicals are in a single smoke they are in minute quantities in that single smoke. Sure some are like iron, not able to be stored in your body, but some are like mercury and will stay in you body for years, if not longer, building in toxicity levels and concentrations until they hit critical levels. Sure the levels in one smoke are microscopic... so what! We aren't here because we smoked one smoke... we are here because we smoked multiple smokes, every day, for years.... lots of the items listed are harmless or even healthy on their own... not all alter chemically when they burn... not all combine within other items listed to make something new and more deadly when they burn and on a per smoke basis the levels are not significant but the the levels of some of these build higher and higher with time. Every smoke adds to your internal toxisity... its not a joke or scare tactics.... those things listed up their are what we need to be aware of.... what we need to know that if we continue to smoke we are putting in our bodies.
    If they didn't put some nice sweet flavours  in the mix ..they would be too bitter to smoke     Some smokers just might not be aware of all the stuff that's goes into cigarettes...I think it was a good Reminder Sally....     
    It is miraculous that our bodies recover from this onslaught.       Also, check out The Great Tobacco Plague, plenty of links and information
    It's just insane... that's what it is..      
Newbies , Lurkers...    Thought I would share my story...Freedom is there...for every smoker ,you just have to want it badly enough...      I smoked my whole adult life....a whopping 52 years ... I tried to Quit hundreds of times ...all lead to failure....I resigned myself to the simple fact I would probably die a smoker....  Then the unthinkable happened ....I was given a choice quit or face quite possibly double amputation of both feet ...   Wow!!!....this news knocked me down for sure ....   My last few cigerettes were smoked with tears flowing ...I was in trouble   I had to try something ...I had to try again...I scanned the internet looking for any help out there ,that would work this time ... I found a smoking forum....I thought I've never tried this before ..might as well give it a go ...  Here I am 6 years later smoke free....  The difference this time was quitting with folks who were just like me,understood what I was going through..supported me every step of the way .... We laugh ...alot ....we cry too....we make friends....we are a family....   Don't think your different from me ...and you carnt quit.....you can ...    The only thing you need is commitment and the desire ....
    Thank you for posting this Doreen - I have had the same thoughts I will die a smoker. I have a week right now and I am embracing that. But your post gives me hope.

Just stay close to the board ,at least for the first 12 months ....
    Thank you for sharing your story Doreen, it's truly an eye opener for anyone still on the fence about quitting, xoxo
    I am so grateful to you for saving your feet and your LIFE !    When I first quit, five or so months after you, I lurked and watched your journey.  You were helping people from the get go, you are a great one, Big D.    We are so lucky to have you here.    
    I am really happy you are here with both feet on the ground supporting the ones in need Doreen!! Thank you for sharing your story 
I'm now on Day 21 of the quit and things are going very well so far.  There is one strange thing that I have been experiencing- a couple of night I have had dreams where I was smoking and I have awoken angry and disgusted with myself thinking that I must have broke down and smoked the night before only to realize after a minute or two that it was just a dream.  Anyone else have this happen to them?  What were your dreams like during the beginning of the quit?
    Yes, I had them in the beginning of my quit.  It amazed me how realistic they were.  I am now over a year quit and I do not have them anymore.  I don't quite remember when they disappeared.
    Oh not weird at all!    Read the dreams of other quiters here:   
YES - I am only a week into my quit and I have 3 smoking dreams - not always me smoking, but trying to get to the store to buy some. All over the place and I have woken up believing I have smoked. UGH
    Addiction is a part of us now, that is just the reality and it takes some time to free our consciousness and sub-consciousness.     From our friend, Joel SpitzerDreams of Smoking       
    Most of us have had those dreams old man coffee, what you're experiencing is completely normal and will eventually go away 
When I quit in 1997 I had the occasional smoking dream and felt really disappointed with myself during the dream and a great sense of relief when I woke up.    I haven't had any with this quit although it's worth remembering that we all dream every night but we have to wake up during them to remember. So, we may dream about them every night but just don't realise it.   If I do have any more dreams about them that I remember, I'm going to take it as a warning that I may be thinking about them subconsciously during the day. My first quit all those years ago served to remind me not to be complacent at any time. I don't think I realised back then that an addiction is for life, it just gets pushed further and further back in our minds as time passes.
    I was one of the few that didn't have those dreams ...  I can just imagine the joy ,when you realise it was a dream and not reality ... It will pass ...
I had one at about the 10 month mark...but in the early quit days I had some truely crazy dreams.....just not smoking ones but often about people here....and really odd.
I just wanted to post after the day I had yesterday. I woke up after having the worst sleep with dreams/nightmares. And honestly the day just went down from there. I pretty much cried over anything yesterday. On my way to work, at work in my office, on the way home, I lost all of my emotions at my daughter's school in the principals office (he must think I am a nut case) and then cried when my husband got home and I told him about my day. I don't know if it was related to my quit (day 3) but holy cow was I mess yesterday.  Has anyone else experienced this during the first few days of their quit or is it not related and I am just losing my mind? I already feel better today, woke up and of course I want a smoke, but I come on here now and read with my morning coffee instead of smoking. I hope it was just an off day yesterday, but seriously I was an emotional mess yesterday and I have not experienced emotions like that in a very long time. But I also have to say I am so PROUD of myself, the thoughts of stopping to get a pack were strong during my crying and sadness, but I did not give in to them - or (and this is amazes me) give them much attention. I want this quit - I am tired of all the effort I put into getting time to smoke in a day.
    Yes Heather!.  You are still in hell week.  The first week you can expect your emotions to be all over the place.  Just know it gets better each day.   Be proud of yourself.  Stay strong.  
Awww So sorry to hear about your day.  But look, its a new day and you haven't smoke!!!!! Keep going my friend!! You can do it!!!Edited October 31 by QueenB
    I told my husband I would not be making any major decisions for a while either.  I was in such a fog!! couldn't remember stuff!!  Yep they call it HELL WEEK for a reason!!
You are not going crazy, you are going through a purge of nicotine and cigarettes.  Be kind to yourself, reward yourself for craves and triggers conquered and remember to Breathe !    Focused breathing will help you through the most gnarly of times.       Many people are highly emotional while quitting,  you needn't fear this, it doesn't last long   and you can learn to change your mood to a kinder place.  Changing your focus is important.     Find something beautiful to look at or listen to or remember and indulge yourself in beauty.    This will give you a shot of endorphins...even faking a smile will do this and then the smile becomes real.     On a deeper level, smoking hid many issues, instead of honestly dealing with these we often just went for a smoke in our avoidance. These may surface and with your new freedom, your new trust in yourself, and with your new self awareness   you will have the tools to examine and deal with anything that pops up.         Here is a video from our friend, Joel Spitzer,  and there are many links The Importance of The First Three Days Of Your Quit that may be helpful for you.       You quit smoking !      and will never have to go through this again !  Hold tight to NOPE...Not One Puff Ever and you will succeed.     Edited October 31 by Sazerac
Definitely not going crazy ....what your experiencing is normal ....    Your body has been fed poisons for years ...it has to adjust ,which it will in time ...every day is a step nearer . My sleeping pattern was all over the place ..coming here 24 hrs a day some days .   I also had a punching pillow .I beat the crap out of it ... We say take it one day at a time...because every day is different...    Our brains are out worst enemies sometimes ...  Come here to scream and vent ....most of us have been there ...
No, you're not crazy and yes, almost all of us went through some variations of the same, and yes, yes, it is temporary, and saner days are on the horizon.  You are the middle of some of the very hardest days where everything is new, but it's a great sign that you are still able to be proud of your tremendous accomplishment.  Irritability was unfortunately my specialty, so you are probably easier to be around than some.  How exciting that day 3 is behind you and most of the nicotine is out of your system, which means you are officially on the the road to healing now.  Come here to yell, vent, cry, laugh, or whatever it takes to keep moving forward, and remember that while things will begin to improve soon, this is not always a linear process so you just have to ride out the twists and turns along the way.
            Thank you so much everyone for your support - I am happy to know I am not alone in the CRAZY town I experienced yesterday.      I think this quote from Sazerac is part of my journey - as soon as I read it - it hit home      On a deeper level, smoking hid many issues, instead of honestly dealing with these we often just went for a smoke in our avoidance. These may surface and with your new freedom, your new trust in yourself, and with your new self awareness   you will have the tools to examine and deal with anything that pops up.         I think I smoked a lot to avoid things at work and at home. I hope I do not have too many of these crying days though or my work is going to think I am going nuts.      
    I am just nodding my head through all the posts. It will get better! And, I won't lie, it will feel like it's getting worse at times (it doesn't, but addiction will tell you it is)    Soak up all the cheers, words and tips here and you will feel stronger and not so alone.    I am just ahead of ya, in a few weeks you will be on my spot, and if I can do it you can too!!! Stick to the forum, stay in the now!! You are doing an awesome job!
    Hi Heather, I'm glad you're past your bad day. Like Jordan, I was more irritated at everything than sad. Does your work know you quit? Sometimes it helps to tell the people you're always around that you've quit so they'll cut you some slack.   I'm glad you came and posted about it. Writing it down helps get it off your chest. And you help others who are going through the same thing along the way 
    It might not feel that way but you are doing great, Heather.   You are going through hell week and it can live up to its name.  A lot of your feelings are normal.      Keep fighting through this as things do get better.  Stay smoke free and you will not have to go through these rough first few days again.      Keep up the great work.
    A little bit of crazy in pursuit of a worthy goal is not a problem.     Cry if you must.  Rave if you like.  Just keep moving forward towards freedom.
    Thanks everyone - I am nervous for the weekend - more free time and I definitely smoked more on the weekends - But I know I can do it one hour one day at at time

    The early weekends were tough for me too because of the extra free time.  As old man coffee just said, try to fill your new free time by trying new things.  Also, spending time here can also help kill time and keep your mind off the smokes.     @HeatherDianne and @Old Man Coffee you are both doing great!

Prepare yourself with rewards for every crave/trigger conquered and remember to Breathe !   Our friend, Joel, has a great materials onFirst Weekend Issues After Quitting Smoking
    The firsts of everything are the hardest but once you get this first one under your belt they get easier and easier. We'll be here if you need us so be sure to post if you're feeling you may cave to a crave and we'll try to help you past it. You got this 
    Yes I am trying to get a pretty busy schedule going. Made a list of things I can do in the house, clean closets etc, baking whatever to keep busy - or if I need it I will pop some popcorn and watch a good movie or two. I want this quit more than I want a smoke and that is what I repeat to myself. I had to get gas today and I said to my son I am getting it right now with you here, I can pay at the pump and I do not need to go inside like I used to to buy my two packs. My son told I can eat his halloween candy if I need it... Well I made a dent today.. Not great for weight gain - But I did not smoke!
    You're doing great Heather, and kudos to your son, he wants this for you just as bad 
    Being prepared is a great start for the weekend- and you are!  The first few weekends were really tough for me.   I’m glad you have recognized the possible challenges you may face & have a plan to thwart the demons that often accompany nicotine withdrawal.  Projects are good - so is rest.   Anything but smoking! You got this...
    You are doing great Heather!! You will make it through the weekend - we believe in you!
    How was your weekend @HeatherDianne? Hope you are doing well!
Thanks for checking in! Honestly it was hell - and I am happy to go back to work just to have a better day. - BUT I DID NOT SMOKE. I am not a joy to be around right now but today is 1 week in a couple hours. I thought I would be prouder and happier, but I am more like ok I got a week  -I can do this happy or sad.
    We are gonna celebrate the hell out of it on the forum Heather!!! Reward yourself!!!

    Well done ..Hell week over ....yes...rewards ..very important.....what you have done is flippin marvellous x
    Woohoo Heather, one week is awesome! And those feelings you're having will go away in time I promise 
    Even if there is some cravings for it ,     Cigarettes are bad      A note to myself , because i have some cravings right now .
    Plus, if you smoked one, if would feel like crap; not only because you ruined your quit but also because you'd be sucking in poison.
Yes , Intentionally smoking poison is really a stupid activity .        I am leaving to middle east (to Saudi Arabia ) for a job next month , which means i have to leave my 3 year old kid and  family in India .      That sucks .        I have depression already .     I am trying hard to think positive      I am trying hard to stay happy
    Leaving your family is sad....but smoking would change anything ...you,d be sad even more ,if you have up your quit ....yes think positive ...
@Doreensfree ,      I was married since 2013 . I have been with them since then .       This is the first time i am leaving my kid and wife , my mother is there too .      So its time to find some extra strength     Thanks for the reply .
    Your quit is young, sunshine.  Please protect it from any interference. You must keep your quit separate from circumstances in your life.   Have a look at Cristóbal'sYour Quit & Your Life--The Proper Sequence
    Yes , Thanks for the reply      I should not make Cigarettes part of any of the life's circumstances .      There must be other ways to contain the frustrations .
    Perhaps 'containing' frustrations isn't the way to go.      Take a good look at your frustrations, a severely honest examination.   How can they, one at a time, be ameliorated ?       Finding new ways to deal with problems is the new challenge and also a way to resolve these issues previously hidden behind a veil of smoke.        This is the journey of our lives.
    Extra powerful hugs for you Sunshine!!  You will be stronger because you defeated another craving. Your circumstances suck big time. There is no denying..but.. this is something you can be proud off! Make your wife and your kid proud! You can do this!!
    I'm sorry you have to leave your family sunshine but as the others have said, smoking won't change that fact. Try to think of the positives of your situation instead of focusing on the negatives. You're in my thoughts, xoxo

    I'm sorry you have to be away from your family but smoking will not help this, or any other situation.  All smoking does is make things worse.      Keep the quit.  You will be glad you did.
Thanks johnny5 ,        I am not planning to inhale poison anymore . The color of my lips and mouth are coming back to its normal color .       I do not want to ruin that .        Yup , 1 month 22 days and counting .         Edited November 4 by Sunshine59
I have just read and viewed a video on your website from "Big Tobacco"  It was mainly directed at our own Belief system which we have deep inside of us which have given us strong reasons why we chose to smoke. I can recall when all the bans came on about smoking in designated areas, where I felt utterly despised almost to a criminal status, this was one of my reasons to continue to smoke, I thought that everyone should choose what they want to do with their life, and not listen to the status quo. A bit of a rebel really. It was by accident that I came across a video during my first few months of quitting, which totally transformed my way of thinking. This was a Video by NASIA DAVOS, called:-  "How to be a happy non smoker" presented by TEDxUniversityofPiraeus. Similar to the one on your website. It made me look at my belief system for many things which I had to unravel before I could understand just why I wasn't able to sustain my quit for longer periods. This false belief system, is perhaps the most crucial to my way of thinking. I wonder if there is another video out there which delves into your belief system of  loosing weight, which is what I am now attempting, (once again) after 7plus months of quitting.

A bit of a rebel really.                I used to think exactly so, forestgreen.    I was an aggressive smoker, smoking where and when as often as possible.    I didn't hide it, I flaunted it.    In the early days of vaping nicotine before any regulation, I would supplement my dry tobacco with a vape   and  I took extra delight in getting my fix in places like Whole Foods or organic groceries. I was an idiot, yes.  I was an addict.     It was only after understanding the tenants of addiction that I was able to admit my folly.     I wasn't a rebel at all.  I was a slave to Big Tobacco  That was a stunning realization for me and helped to power my quit          57 minutes ago, forestgreen said:               I wonder if there is another video out there which delves into your belief system of  loosing weight, which is what I am now attempting, (once again) after 7plus months of quitting.               Here is a page of resources from our friend, Joel Spitzer concerning weight.Weight Related Resources        and a video
    Great post forestgreen, I was one of those smokers too until I came to terms with the addiction!

This false belief system, is perhaps the most crucial to my way of thinking.                Cognitive dissonance is as vital to addiction as the drug of choice itself.     The very moment you drop your defense of the addiction and allow yourself to accept the truth, the entire myth of the cigarette unravels immediately.       We all accepted bullshit as holy writ while still feeding our addiction.  Deluding ourselves was necessary to keep feeding the very beast that was killings us.     The truth is the arch enemy of addiction.
Thanks to all, I am glad I am not the only rebel in the pack. Pretty much a quieter (if that is possible) person to be around, I still get annoyed at some things, but I try not to hang onto the situation as much. The diet thing; I have only gained around 5 kilos and have upped my exercise, but after looking at the resources, will be planning my meals more, I know I have to do something, I had a dream recently, where I was eating everything in sight on the table, stuffing it into my mouth, I didn't like this dream at all. So meal planning and cleaning teeth after dinner might be the go. Not one Puff Ever for Breakfast Not one Puff Ever for Lunch Not one Puff ever for Dinner.
Hello all, it's been awhile since I've posted , but this place hasn't been far from my thoughts. Tomorrow at 5:46 PM will be a year quit for me. I just wanted you all to know I may not have made it through the first part of this journey with out your help. I had to go out on my own without my safety net to complete first step. For those of you just finding it...use it and learn from the people here. I found out they knew and felt every emotion I was feeling and could talk me off the edge when needed ….it may be quite a few times before it's all said and done, but come here for help, it's worth it. I don't think it is ever over, the cravings, but they will as everyone says here , get better. Everything will look up for you and when it does it will astonish you how much better you feel... not only physically but mentally about yourself. Thank you all for your help it is and was much appreciated. And you new quitters...get on and ride this train and keep the NOPE attitude.
    Love this wantsit, and I'm so happy to be able to celebrate your one year anniversary tomorrow with you  
    I am so happy for you @Wantsit !For sure, you 'gots it' now.Congratulations on your First YEAR of Freedom.   Cravings and Triggers fade and fade, fading imperceptibly after a while.I think of smoking as a concept now and as a result of volunteering here, I think about many aspects of nicotine addictionbut, out in the other world, I don't think about my smoking or not smoking.It is never a temptation or even a fleeting but, annoying thought anymore and hasn't been since the first year or so.I still pay mind to NOPE and grateful at the end of the day that I remain free.      Stay vigilant, you beautiful nicotine free creature, and continue to reward yourself.   You have built a marvelous quit.
    Welcome back Wantsit.       Congratulations on four seasons of freedom.     See you on the lido deck.

Are your hands and feet always cold? Mine were. Until I quit smoking.   I knew smoking affected my lungs and blood pressure. I've been on blood pressure medicine since my late 30's and instead of quitting smoking I chose to have tubal ligation surgery because my Dr wouldn't prescribe birth control after 40 years old IF I WAS A SMOKER.    But I never contributed my cold feet and hands to smoking until I quit. When you lose circulation to your extremities you risk the loss of limb.  I wish I remembered just how far into my quit I was before I noticed it but at the time I was too concerned about my bleeding gums to even notice. Turned out this too was the new flow of blood due to quitting and within a month or so my gums had color back to them. Many of our members have had tens of thousands of work done to restore their teeth after quitting.  As far as my hands and feet are concerned, they've never been warmer. So why am I bringing this up three years after quitting? Because I don't want to ever forget where I came from.   So for anyone still on the fence about quitting, all you need to do is search our forum with the keyword circulation and you'll find many former smokers who had these issues too. And you'll also see how much better they got after they quit smoking.
    It's not just your lungs ,smoking effects every part of your body ...   Great post Jillar ...   My ankles were covered in black bruises...swollen and sore....they looked as if I had hit them with a baseball bat .    Walking was painful ...in bed they were sore and itchy ...but if I scratched it would hurt more ..  I had to make a choice ....Stop smoking or face amputation ....was it too late ...  I made the decision to quit .... Thankfully it wasn't too for me ...which I will be forever grateful..  I had a good outcome ...I kept my feet ....there are plenty who are not so lucky ...    I have a few battle wounds still there.....they are a great reminder ...    Never Take Another Puff...
I've said this elsewhere but this is to reiterate for any wannabee quitter that may be reading. I was quite well read on the dangers of smoking but it took a nurse to say that the circulation in my leg was worsening for me to finally take notice and quit. The problem started about four years ago whilst on holiday when my calf muscle started to ache after a few hundred yards of walking. I sort of shrugged it off for a while but I eventually went for circulation tests. I had narrowing of the artery in my right leg and it's efficiency was 80%. Did I give up smoking then? No, I didn't because I thought that being an ostrich may be the best way to deal with it.    I went yearly with the same results with the same resultant head burying approach. However, I went again on the 22/8/19 to hear that the efficiency in the leg was now 70%. The nurse gave me a talking to and more or less said that I will eventually lose my leg at that rate.   Well, that was it folks, the penny finally dropped so I quit on the 23/8/19.    That advice from the nurse was a very good motivator I must admit.
    I suffer from a condition called Raynaud's Syndrome, which impacts the blood flow to my fingers and toes. (I've actually gotten frostbite without ever leaving my house!) When I was diagnosed, my rheumatologist told me I absolutely had to quit smoking, because smoking constricts the blood flow even further and makes Raynaud's so much worse. I was in danger of losing fingers or toes! (I still am, but smoking greatly increased the risk.)      Incidentally, my rheumatologist was actually giddy when I told him I quit!
@abbynormal my mum, her sister, my 2 sisters and my cousin all have Raynaud's.... I am the only one who doesn't have it. Can I just say when its 42C and they are walking around with hands like ice I don't mind if they touch me.

@notsmokinjo you are so lucky you don't have it. It's a real pain.As soon as the temp dips below 75 F my fingers and toes start losing circulation. I've had to take out stock in extra warm wool socks and lined boots.
    My lot have it as CREST syndrome but only my Aunty and one of my sisters have all the crest conditions. My other sister, mum and cousin both have Reynaud's and Scerladerma. I did luck out big time by missing that little genetic gift. I keep my eyes on my daughter but considering she 'runs hot' hopefully she has missed out on this too. Its awful and I know they all suffer. We joke they have shares in ugg boots. Do you get the chilblains too? My pore aunty got one on her nose this winter.      
@notsmokinjo I have CREST/systemic scleroderma. I'm so sorry to hear it runs in your family. It's not a disease I would wish on anyone. Not even my worst enemy. I do get chillblains, as well. I got a particularly nasty one on my toe last year. I was afraid I'd lose the toe. I have to be so careful with my hands and feet. It's ridiculous!
    Wow, I am on vacation in Frankfurt and compared to the Netherlands it's smoke country. They sell it everywhere and have ads everywhere you look. It's insane really. There are two cig machines in the hotel lobby.. and yeah it's even harder to stay persistant and to not let go of the rope.    Really happy I have such an understanding and trustworthy partner. He is my rock.. and he doesn't mind me talking through the cravings alot more now than it was at home.   Talking about unsafe zones.. Germany is one...      But! I keep on hanging in there! I will!!!! Nope!!!
    Getting past this will be a HUGE victory for you Vivianne, I know you got this. We're here if you need us and give that boyfriend of yours a big hug from all of us, he's a keeper!
I agree with jillar.  That boyfriend is definitely a keeper.  Concentrate on romancing him instead of smoking.      You are doing so great Vivianne.  Stay strong.  Your cravings will pass!Edited October 26 by Linda Thomas

Some quitters may have trouble with the never/ever part of  NOPE (Not One Puff Ever).    To tell you the truth,  in the nascence of my quit, I  bluffed my way through never/ever land. I remember Cristobal and Stuart qualifying never/ever with the caveat,  'just for today'    and that was the truth too, it is just about here and now.   As days and weeks passed,  I absorbed the truth about addiction.   Once I clearly understood addiction is forever  and the brain's neuro pathways immediately re-connect  to addiction after one puff, I embraced never/ever/forever.   If addiction was in my brain for the long haul, well dammit...I was too    and I was going to Win !         Edited August 31, 2018 by Sazerac
Nice post!!!! For me NOPE is my Moto now, but in those early stages. I would wake up and tell myself "I will not smoke today, tomorrow will take care of it's self" If it was a good day great! Tick it of on the calendar as another day done!If it was a bad day, take it hour by hour. There are lots of things you can do NOT to smoke, distract yourself and keep busy all day. At the end of that day treat yourself to something. It doesn't have to be big, something just to make you smile. By doing this technique day after day, week after week and more, you will win this.
NOPE...Smoking is not on the table...ever..this is what I lived by..I followed these rules one day at a time...I understood this..
First thin in the morning Not One Puff Ever...Just for today. Repeat. Works.
NOPE...Smoking is not on the table.... The decision to remove smoking as an option, just take it off the table, was a major key to my success quitting. Gets back to the whole simplicity of quitting concept yet again.  You don't have to do anything, you simply don't smoke.  That's it.
I don't dare take a puff. Just this once would become just this once in awhile would become just for a little while would become me "huffin' the hookah." Nope.
Thumbs up  NOPE.   
You know, I am a commitment-phobe.  I like living spontaneously but, after I learned and accepted, 'addiction is FOREVER'   my quit solidified and I committed to not one puff Ever, Never, Forever.        Now, the concept of commitment deserves my attention and  further investigation.    I am not afraid of it out of hand anymore because it helped me stay Nicotine FREE.  This is another benefit of quitting for me.Edited April 10, 2018 by Sazerac

    Thanks for the repost ... Love your work.
    This is a nice post.        It rolls off the tongue, never, ever, forever. 
    I also had trouble with the "ever" in NOPE when i first quit, it was 'just for today'. Each morning I pledged NOPE on the board and stuck with it for the day and then got up the next morning and did it again. Eventually i also came around to understanding addiction, and how my addiction had distorted my thinking, and committed to the forever part of ever.

    NOPE is all you need
    That Never Ever stays foremost in my mind.  Getting rid of the nicotine out of my body has not been an easy journey.  I've been at it for almost two months now and am not quite sure if it is completely gone.  I still have some pretty crappy feeling days.  The thought of going back repulses me.  I so want that freedom and the joy that comes along with it.  
    There is going to be curves in the track...quitting is a journey... Your still early in your journey Linda...   Already though ..you know there is no going backwards...the way is forward.....the curves will get fewer and more smootfher...  Upwards and onwards..

It is more than a few days for your body to get rid of nicotine, a lot depends on how long/how much you smoked.     Tar isn't expelled from the lungs quickly....it is tar for heaven's sake...you need gasoline to get it off your feet !      The good news is that, in time, it will leave your body completely and quit harassing the receptors in your brain.      Please cut yourself some slack.     Your body is working overtime purging out the nicotine and creating new, clean synapses in your brain.  All this is serious healing that you cannot see, that is part of the magic.     You can see and appreciate how far you have come in a short time.   You can see how you have changed your patterns, how you have taken full control of your life !      You ARE free, part of you just hasn't caught up with the rest.          I know you are tired of hearing us say, ' be patient, things will start to get a whole lot better'  but, you have to trust us.  We don't lie.

Ok... I had huge issues with NOPE when I first joined a quit forum... I wanted to NOPE... all the cool kids NOPEd.... but Not One Puff Ever... the Ever... I didn't have faith in myself to publicly pledge EVER.... because what if I couldn't.... what then.... I had just lied to everyone.... so for over 2 weeks maybe 3 I'd go into the NOPE thread and like the nopes.... that was it... just like them because if someone was noping I wanted to let them know it had been seen.... and then someone said in their nope.... NOPE just for today.... and still it took a while for me to get it.... but once I did that first little NOPE.... it was like building a brick wall between me and smoking... NOPE.... one little acronym, declared infront of everyone began that change in my thinking from oh wow I went another day... to I am going to do this... this it Jo.... so you will notice around the boards I post pictures of myself as a kangroo... its not just cos I'm an Aussie.... its because there are two interesting facts about Kangaroos... 1 they can't fart and 2... they can't move backwards, sideways sure but backwards it is physically impossible for them to hop backwards... same as the emu they can't walk backwards either... that's why they are on the Aussie coat of arms... forever going forward.... so everyone, embrace your inner roo (or emu, and its pronounced Eam-you ...eam as is ream... an emu would be a good choice, they are great in a battle, they even beat the Aussie army in the great Western Australian emu war)...and only move forward.... Be the roo!

    Got rear ended in traffic today.  Quite an impact.  Got checked out at the local hospital and stepped outside to take a bit of fresh air and appreciate my continued existence.     Smokers were outside smoking and it would have been no effort to ask for one.  Just to calm the nerves that were all a jingle.      I talked myself out of it.  Celebrating my fortune by poisoning myself seemed like spitting in lady luck's eye.     So yeah, we still get close calls and fender bender after we quit smoking.          Such are the vagaries of chance that are outside my control.        What's not chance is the decision not to smoke.         This is something I can control.        *NOPE*

    You made a great life choice Sirius!     
    So glad you weren't seriously hurt! I would have been triggered by that. Car accidents (or any car trouble in general) trigger my anxiety so badly. Your post is an excellent reminder that we are in control of our choice whether or not to smoke, even during triggering events like these!

    Glad you ok .S !!!! Very happy you kept your fabulous quit ...smoking wouldn't have changed anything ...only made it  worse ..
So you've relapsed again for the umpteenth time. You come to the board admitting your failure and get a mixture of responses. Some positive and it makes you get right back to your quit. Some negative and you're afraid to post or start again because you'll only fail and upset people. But the truth is, who cares what we think? It's your life, your quit. You decide when you're ready to quit. We offer the support, along with a huge library of education. We also offer a ton of socializing topics to help distract you and keep your mind off smoking.    Please remember that we have lots of "chronic" relapsers who finally found their forever quit and so can you. Never Give up giving up. Edited August 21 by jillar
    I feel so excited when someone new posts that they want to quit.  A chance to help someone else change their life.      Of course I feel a huge disappointment when you relapse.  Only because I know that, if you can just hang tough, you can succeed too.    Never give up quitting and don't quit posting.

So far so good here. I’m hanging  tough . I don’t think I could have done it if I hadn’t found this site. So much info and so many cheerleaders here! And I know it’s going to get better each day. If you are  struggling  With your quit or just struggling to set your quit date, this is a great place to be. Read read read. There are so many wonderful quit stories on here. Not all of them  smooth sailing that’s for sure. Some relapsed and got right back onto a new quit. So I say chaos to you jillar for starting this thread. It’s an important one. So many may just stop by here are see this and not pick up that cancer stick! Edited August 6 by Diane R
Sure, your support system here feels joyful euphoria in success and sad frustration in failure but, it is not about us .    like Jillar says,       13 hours ago, jillar said:              But the truth is, who cares what we think?              We want to encourage and support, provide education and some distraction and fun as well.   Some of us have Tough Love, some the Warm and Fuzzy Love.   I think Jillar also said that 'it takes a village to help a quitter'.   So right !  So, take what you need and leave the rest.  One or many of our voices will resonate with you and the educational materials are exceptional.     Know that everyone has the ability to quit, wrap your mind around that.  Don't be a doubter.    Commit to NOPE and there you have it !
    So right ....the important thing ,is saving your life ...from this horrible addiction...    Yes ok ...i have  a frying pan ...but I've yet to use it ....   This board has saved  countless of lives....what's more important than yours....    Just jump back on..your seats still here...
Jillar -    Thank you. Thank you.       When I blew my 1.5 year quit, I got the mixture of reactions you mentioned. Some came across kind of rude, some were polite. There was one person here in particular who was not judging but "professional" with feedback. It was the last person on here I expected to be so (insert whatever positive verb.)  I have more respect for this person now than I could have imagined. One of the true leaders around here.    As someone told me, when you take a fall, it is interesting to see who steps up and who kicks you when you are down.        So for Jillar in particular, I think we may have disagreed at times (probably cause I tend to be smart ass). If so, I would now like to bury the hatchet.

After reading your relapse thread, nobody kicked you when you were down. Nobody.    Have a look at it yourself, So Now What.  I see two pages of support, what did you see ?        How is your quit going ?  What was different for you in this quit ?  Was it easier ?  harder ?  What steps are you taking to prevent another relapse ?  All of us can learn from your experience.
Totally agree.  We have to get up and try again and it might be the one.  My own path is a string of failures with just the 1 success at the end.       And also, Jill, you're awesome.

So far it has been harder cause I was smoking real cigarettes instead of those "roll your own" using pipe tobacco. Yeah that stuff is weak. Quitting it was not hard.   Steps to not relapse - Just don't buy cigarettes. My room mate doesn't use it so there is none.     HERE is what caused my hard relapse -       Oct 2017 was the start of the 1.5 year quit. In April I smoked like 6 cigs, but just wasn't into it and quit. Then toward the end of May, some kleptomaniac decided to rip me off. Maybe my fault but it kind of set me back at a bad time. I was pissed and had all kinds of negative emotions, more than I had experienced in years. About the first week of June I decided "Oh screw it" and bought a pack, thinking, "It doesn't matter anyways".   Well earlier this week, I woke up and could hear my own breath. Smoker's cough was coming back. I had spent $160 in two months on my habit. I thought, "This just needs to stop."   So far, I have been playing referee to several imaginary fights going on in my head.        Now either you or Jillar has a thread, "what have you learned..." I need to put something important in there, lemme find it.

23 hours ago, JB 883 said:              Jillar -                    Thank you. Thank you.                                       When I blew my 1.5 year quit, I got the mixture of reactions you mentioned. Some came across kind of rude, some were polite. There was one person here in particular who was not judging but "professional" with feedback. It was the last person on here I expected to be so (insert whatever positive verb.)                  I have more respect for this person now than I could have imagined. One of the true leaders around here.                    As someone told me, when you take a fall, it is interesting to see who steps up and who kicks you when you are down.                                        So for Jillar in particular, I think we may have disagreed at times (probably cause I tend to be smart ass). If so, I would now like to bury the hatchet.           JB ...how strange a post this is ...for someone coming back to the forum asking for help again, to help you Quit .  I too have read through all the replies you received when you gave up your quit ..  What I see is a board full of people who supported you in quitting again ...you say rude ...I say honest posts .    How boring this place would be ,if everyone said the same thing ...I think you should go read them again ,this time with a open mind .. Yes our jillar is one great peep...but it seems you had your difference,s in the past ,and I'm happy to hear the hatchet has been buried... I hoping you have come back here in earnest to have support ,to help you Quit again ... Not to slate the members who do thier best to support all quitters ...
I am feeling some bits of despair in the ether from people who have recently been here and relapsed.        I don't blame them for feeling low down.    Addiction is serious business.  So serious that it takes your full attention and focused intention to have a successful quit.       I can only recommend learning as much as you can about addiction.   Read the materials here and from other places.  Read until your eyes bleed. Even if you think you know all about it, you must imprint this information on your brain with indelible ink.        Get right with yourself,  make the commitment to NOPE   and stand by your commitment.   Do not waver.  Hold yourself accountable.   We are talking about saving your life, the quality of your life and the quality of your family's life.      Stay in touch with this community.  Post often, tell us how you are feeling and post support for others.    The more invested you are in your quit, the greater chances of your success.        I hope y'all come back with a renewed passion to quit. Everyday is a good day to quit smoking and the sooner the better.                     Edited August 13 by Sazerac

All the would have/could have and denial of the addiction that I was in - quitting only to relapse only to quit and relapse over and over was MADDENING!!! THERE IS NOTHING AND I MEAN NOTHING GOOD ABOUT SMOKING PERIOD. But you know this already...…...we all did and do.      I blamed all my relapses on anyone and anything I could - but in all honesty I was weak!! I was an addict who thought like a junkie and now I am fighting for my very life due to that very denial. You have to stop the fight with your mind and commit yourself to the battle. There is no in between. It's not easy but nothing in life is. It's in these moments that you will find your greatest resolve and all the will power and strength you can muster to continue forward and commit to NOPE!        You can make each day easier or each day harder - the choice is always yours. DO NOT make the same mistakes I did and sit in denial thinking it will NEVER happen to you and that just one more puff will be okay. I promise you it is NOT WORTH IT. And I have to echo Sazerac in that:  Everyday is a good day to quit smoking and the sooner the better! I truly wish you the best of luck!!!

    It's important to tell these truths about smoking in the hopes it helps just one person quit for good. I lost both my dad and his younger brother (my uncle) to smoking related cancer and still continued to smoke until my health started suffering because of it.    PLEASE don't be stupid like me, quit while you can still take nice deep breaths.... You may get a little tough love now and then if you relapse but it only means that we care. We will never give up on you and will be cheering you on at every milestone. Also remember to take what you need and leave the rest. You may not always agree with everyone, especially early in your quit,  but personally for me I found that the people who bugged me the most in my early days were the people I ended up becoming great friends with. So keep an open mind and an open heart.......

I lost my best friend 15 months ago ,to a cancer related to smoking ..I know your pain ...  And my life long partner of 48 years  3 months ago...   Don't leave it till it's too late ..the time to Quit is TODAY !!!
    I would add that it is not necessarily  "too late" to get any benefit out of quitting even if you are already experiencing problems or have been diagnosed with a smoking-related disease.  With most conditions, your ability to fight the disease and/or slow down or minimize the progression will be much greater the sooner you stop smoking and stop adding to the damage. 
    Every quit is different.  What may be easier for one, may not be as easy for another.  I am not here to judge anyone.  I just want to be here to support you and help you through the process.  I know you appear because you want to quit.  I get so disheartened when you struggle and leave.     I think that, even if you can share your struggle, something might click to help you find your way to success.  
I often get a little down and frustrated maintaining the Anniversary list. Where did this person go? What happened to that person? All of them were so full of commitment mere days ago or at least weeks ago. Then their Anniversary date comes around and I see they haven't logged on in days or even weeks. Not all are fresh quitters either. Some have months under their belts. Some may have just decided this forum was not for them I suppose but in my heart of hearts I suspect I know what's happened to most of them because I've been standing on that ledge myself, looking over the edge into the abyss of relapse but somehow gathered the mental strength to rip 1 more NOPE from somewhere inside me and that's all I needed until that overpowering urge faded. This addiction is one of the worst possible ones to wrestle under control for most but we all know how important it is to do just that. Although it can be a challenging and sometimes difficult process, quitting has never killed anyone that I am aware of. The alternative will at least shorten your life if not outright kill you.
I cared a lot what the people here thought (well, not here exactly, but at the last board where I "met" many of you for the first time), because I was ready to hold myself accountable but knew I didn't have it in me quite, and I needed to be held accountable.  I think when you come to a message board for support, you have to be ready to accept that support - you have to have just enough belief in yourself to trust that there was a reason you showed up in the first place, but after that, you have to let others help you out.  I needed the jabs that I got when I first arrived - asking me why I was setting a quit date so far in the future when I could quit sooner and get the hard stuff over with and not risk backing out of my commitment.  I credit whoever said that to me (which was NOT what I wanted to hear...) with saving my life.     I haven't been around in a long time, but I'm still quit.  Umm... 20 months at the end of August, I think?  I don't miss smoker-farmgirl one bit.
Those that quit before you @farmgirl knew full well that your junkie thinking would have talked you out of quitting long before your quit date arrived and yeah, as a still smoker, that's NOT what you wanted to hear but fortunately you listened and quit. Great job on 20 Months smoke free by the way! Ain't life great as a nonsmoker?

    Sometimes the anxiety created by over thinking quitting seems insurmountable.   This is just the addiction speaking and not a truth.    Quitting is doable, always. It is a matter of choice.       Sure, you may have uncomfortable moments but, nothing you cannot handle, believe me.            I decided to give this 'quitting thing' a year and see how I felt.  I could always go back to smoking but, I thought, 'hey, what else am I doing with my time ?  Why not give it all I have ?'  It became a personal challenge      When I quit and started learning all I could about nicotine addiction, I quickly understood that I was quitting 'forever' and not just for a year.  It was a natural progression and one of thought and sanity, I was building a new free person.       Take the chance on yourself.  You needn't continue the slavery to nicotine.  You can earn and cherish your Freedom. I know you can.
In celebration of my Six Years of Freedom, I wrote this little piece,      Sazerac's Simple Guide To Freedom     Desire:   You must want to quit more than you want to smoke     Decision:    Make the decision to live life without Nicotine, commit to this decision and intend on standing by your resolve.   Choice:    Choose to never smoke again, EVER.  This choice will empower you in many, many ways.           “Once you make a decision, the universe conspires to make it happen.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson       Education.  Thanks to Joel Spitzer, this site and lurking around the sphere, I am still learning everything I can about Nicotine addiction.Information is Big Power and I feel sufficiently armed to maintain my quit.      Changing Focus.It took some doing but, s l o w l y, when junkie thoughts would drag me down, I began to train myself to look at something beautiful or think of beauty in some way.This retrained my brain and also gave me a bump of endorphins.   I now use this technique during any moments of distress or discomfort.These are not nicotine related anymore, just moments of life.     The concept of H.A.L.T.(are you Hungry, Angry (emotional), Lonesome (bored), Tired).Nine times out of ten, smokey thoughts weren't about nicotine at all,it was my body (poor thing) hollering at me to do something life sustaining for it.    Now, the signals are very clear and not related to nicotine in any way.     Rewards.Not only does rewarding yourself help to re-wire your brain receptors,treating yourself well and being as kind to yourself as you possibly can makes life so nice.A little spoiling goes a long way,  especially during rugged transitions of any kind.     Quitting smoking has taught me so much about myself and the human condition.The truth and honesty involved in making and keeping a commitment to myself has been profound.I know myself so much better.  I have exchanged an empty bravado for an inner trust and knowledge.    I am grateful to everybody here, your stories, your triumphs and your lapses, too.ALL have helped me understand the hideousness of nicotine addiction and the power of Choice, the preciousness of Freedom.     I am so proud to be part of this community.Y'all are beautiful nicotine free creatures, my friends.     S       
    Great post saz, thank you 
    Thank you for sharing that with us!
    My brother is one of those weird smokers in that he can do without them for periods of time - a week, a month etc. Having said that, he's been vaping for a couple of years so all smokers are addicts however many or often they smoke, as we all know.    He's been enquiring about my quit and encouraging me because he knows about the circulation problem in my leg. We were chatting on the phone about all this and he said, "Right, I'm chucking the e-cig away and joining you." If he's made up his mind he can do it and I'll keep the pressure on him.     He's not really a forum person so I doubt he will join here but I can post updates for him. Well done my brother Nigel.  
    Quitting is always a good thing whether he's a regular smoker or just occasional. Congrats Nigel on deciding to take back your life!    Glad your example was able to convince him  
    That's awesome, MB!  I'm glad you helped inspire him.       Congratulations Nigel.  Quitting smoking is a great thing to do.
    Yay Phil and congratulations Nigel! We have a pretty good section of vape articles that even if he isn't a forum guy may be worth him checking out 
    Yayyy, way to go Nigel

Hi Guys! I am currently 21 days in my quit smoking journey! I had a chest infection 3 weeks ago which scared me off cigarettes, now it’s all good and well but I still have an annoying dry cough sometimes productive producing clear phlegm. But also chest pains/aches, like around the entirety of the lungs area. Has anyone else experienced this?        Im 23, started 3 years ago only smoked like 8-10 if that a day.
    Welcome Axyz, congrats on three weeks quit, that's awesome!   When we quit the lungs start right away working hard to clear our lungs of all the gunk from smoking. Some of us cough out the phlegm and some of us, like me, don't. But the phlegm does still find a way out if you know what I mean lol. Clear phlegm is a good sign that there's no more infection.As far as your chest pain, it's probably from all the coughing but if you're really concerned about it you should definitely go see your dr.
    Welcome to Quit Train Axyz! You're doing the best thing you possibly can for yourself by quitting and with three weeks already behind you, you're well on your way - keep going.        As Jillar said, it's pretty common to cough a lot of crap up in the early stages of quitting and the pain could be muscular pain from all the coughing. Do get it checked though if you are concerned or if it persists.        Also, stick around this forum because there's lots of information about nicotine addiction and quitting and super great support from other quitters who have been through the sames thing you are now experiencing  
    The side effects of a chest infection lasts quite a while so it might be that. Just think how bad you would feel if you were still pumping smoke into your lungs every day.         No harm in getting your doctor to check you out to be on the safe side. 
Great job on the 3 weeks.  As said above it takes a little time to clear out the lungs but that is a good thing.  Also as said if anything concerns you make sure you contact a medical professional to have it checked out.  Keep strong you are doing an awesome job!!!!
    Congratulations on your quit, Axyz. See your doctor with your concerns. Here is what our friend, Joel says about some of your issues     
I am no doc but I cannot imagine 1/2 a pack a day for three years did any real damage.          On 9/23/2019 at 12:07 PM, jillar said:   When we quit the lungs start right away working hard to clear our lungs of all the gunk from smoking.

Not trying ti put words in Jillar's mouth here, however, I think what she means is the waste products from smoking tend to sneak out the back door eventually.
    Am experiencing the cleansing cough right now. My quit so far is like me, always on schedule haha
    Did I smoke today?      It is the one and only question that matters when quitting.  I've seen some recent posts in which people call themselves "bad quitters" because they craved and/or romanced the cigarette during their quit.  There is no such thing as a "bad quitter."  There are only successful quitters and smokers.       If you craved a cigarette but didn't smoke, you are a successful quitter.  If it took you a while to rewire your brain about the realities of cigarettes but you didn't smoke, you are a successful quitter.        Smoking is an addiction.  Cigarettes are something we conditioned ourselves with for years.  Quitting is a process.     If the process was a bit more difficult for you than others.  If it took you a little while longer to turn the corner than others.  If you really, really, really wanted to smoke a cigarette.  If you were grouchy, bordering on homicidal, during parts of your quit...If any of these conditions applied and you stayed true to your commitment and did not smoke, congratulations.  Your quit is every bit as much of a successful quit as anyone else's.       To smoke or not to smoke...it is the only question that matters when quitting.
    That's right! We all face some sort of challenges when we start our quit but no matter what happens along our own individual paths, as long as we didn't smoke during those challenges, we are winners - non-smokers - quitters and, proud of it  
Thanks, Boo, for a great, thoughtful post.  I was pretty hard on myself during the first year of my quit,   'free-ing my head' was arduous at times, long and weary times.      I knew I would give it a year but, sometimes the slog made me feel crazy, a self-induced sado-masochistic crazy.    My addict's voice would wheedle, 'why are you punishing yourself ?' It took a lot of education to extricate the truth from my addled, addicted brain.       Sometimes, with the 20/20 vision of hindsight, I think that I should have/could have made it easier on myself   and maybe some of that is true  but, the point is, I built myself a rock solid quit and that is all that matters.       I don't Smoke. I won't Smoke.   NOPE-ly yours,  S
    Boo well said, thank you for posting this.  You made the process of quitting "real" and we all need to realize is that if we make it through each day no matter the challenges that we are indeed successful in are quits and that we must focus on this!!!

Oh this is me right now.  Sometimes I wonder who that person is.  I can be pretty ornery some days but then I cut myself some slack.  I kind of look at that meanness as a way to turbo charge me through the crave.  At the end of the day I did not smoke and that is what counts.
    I was just thinking people are obviously grouchy, homicidal, weary, crazy, ornery whether quitting or not. Do you think the quit exaberates who we just are as people? Or are these new emotions to you guys?       I was never OTT emotional in my quit and I wasnt an OTT emotional person before my quit either. I'm a positive and confident person. And I felt more positive and more confident during my quit and thereafter.         I do now though, have a very short temper in my car and can be seen giving the Vicky out the window most days haha I think before I was too busy smoking to notices all the assholes on the road! 
You may be right Weegie!    I'm pretty grumpy and a bit of a closet A-hole normally so the added anxiety of quitting probably heightened those traits my wife married me for    I was pretty quick to get frustrated and angry for probably the first 4-5 months of my quit. It was the longest lasting symptom for me personally.Edited November 30, 2018 by reciprocity
    I'm a very laid back person....no line in the sand....  I did go angry for a short time ,at the very beginning..... I soon went back to my old self....
Others in my realm may disagree, but I am not a natural psycho. Eccentric,  maybe...unconventional, for sure...creative, happy, supportive and positive are closer to my modus operandi.        I felt psycho because all I could think about was the issue of smoking.     I wasn't going to smoke but, addiction thoughts/actions and the addict's voice in my head   took a long time and effort to clear.       The body memories took their time too   but, considering I  smoked for 40 some odd years, smoking everywhere/anywhere/all the time/doing anything/everything    one year of work wasn't too long or arduous  to attain my freedom.      In fact, I got off light. I'm pretty healthy.  I can breath.        So, my cray was directly associated with addressing my  nicotine addiction  and disappeared when I had reclaimed most of the receptors in my brain, freeing my dosage of dopamine from the association with nicotine.

I think maybe the first week or so I was a bit more agro than normal... it was like I forgot how to count to 10... so my temper was on a hair trigger.... and even after the initial few weeks it was still a case of watch it when I lost it cos I would just go mental... but I know I have a tendency to that anyway... i did feel like I had less control over it.      so back to Boo's initial centiment....      waking up in the morning I promise myself: I will not smoke today.  going to bed at night I acknowledge: Today was a success, I did not smoke.

All that really matters is if you actually lit up or not.     Some people have this weird philosophy like just thinking of doing something is the same as doing it (like you have already sinned in your heart).      Well if THAT is the case then here is my confession - I have been smoking five packs a day since Oct 6 2017. No, I didn't smoke smoke but I did so in my heart. Not like through a vulva or vestibule in my throat but just imagining smoking. What is that hole in the throat called that some smokers get so they can smoke two cigarettes at once?       But if "just thinking of doing something" is the same as doing it, I have also been going to the gym, cleaning up my diet, working overtime, volunteering at the soup kitchen...

    bump.... cos while it got a bit silly the original post was pretty brilliant.... and we have some newbies here who need a reminder... thinking about smoking and actually smoking are two different things... it doesn't matter how often you think about smoking as long as you just don't smoke you have been successful regardless of the conscious or sub-conscious thoughts.

    Oi newbies an inbetweenies.... Read this... Please.
                     
    Great bump ....
    Joel is brilliant. I binge watched him when I first quit, and still watch him now and again.

    Oh gonna steal that pic Boo!! I love that quote!

It will be very interesting and encouraging to newbies as well as oldies how quitting smoking has had unexpected benefits in our lives. 
I'm a short answer kinda gal, so I'll be short.  :) Unexpected benefit was that I became much more self-confident.  While smoking, I always felt like "I couldn't. :( about so many things in life."  Quitting made me feel like, "I can, and it feels AWESOME!!!! :) :) :) "
For me NOPE isn't just a saying...it is a way of life now... Cigarettes used to be my way of life....now NOPE is my way of life.... Not One Puff Ever I do / say this every single day and have done since March 2014... Best free therapy I have ever been given.
I don't feel or smell like an ashtray anymore. :)
I don't feel or smell like an ashtray anymore. :) You smell fantastic :)
More physical activities without complaining. Not just talking gym stuff. All kinds of walking, bike riding. Taking the steps. Parking at en of lot so car don't get dinged. No problem.
I got to meet a whole lot of awesome people on this site
I got to meet a whole lot of awesome people on this site.... and we got to meet you, Awesome :)
I was not expecting a deep and unshakable confidence.  While I always used  'fake it till you make it' in my life and appeared to many as confident,  today,  I am in complete possession of myself. True Confidence, a great CALM in my spirit and a deeper Honesty with myself. My inner path is now open for further exploration.
I agree with petra it gives you a sense of confidence and achievement that you can change anything that before maybe fear was holding you back no matter how old you are you have the power to change things for the better a better job, partner hobby or fitness etc quitting smoking apart from the health and financial benefits opens up so many doors of possibilities you just got to go for it :)
Quitting has gave me a great jolt of self confidence, something I feel is clouded whilst smoking. Meeting great supportive people whom understand what you are going through, even though I am only surpassing my one month I also feel I am way less stressed. :)
Life will always have highs and lows.  As a non smoker the highs are higher, and the lows are not as bad.  I thought before that smoking alleviated stress-quite the opposite.
It is newer for me then many others here as I am just approaching 3 months - but I do feel as if I have more pride and confidence - I don't feel like the outcast trying to find somewhere I can just go and smoke - I am free to go where ever I wan,t I smell better, look better and feel better - I guess I don't feel ashamed anymore in the eyes of my kids, family and friends. It's just a great feeling to walk with my head held high again etc..

I'm not clinging on my asthma puffs since I no longer smoke I still use the puffs but I never have an asthma attack!!!I'm FREE from chasing my neighbor and begging her for a fag!!! I dont smell horrible anymore.I still use the nicotine gum but am tapering it off in how long I use it no longer 4 mg but I'm on 2 mg. I can SMELL again!!!And whenever I feel an excuse raise in my head I just say NOPE and if neded write a post in SOS and while I write an SOS I already choose not to smoke but writing it down helps straighten it out!
I have finally took control of my life....Smoking never did help solve life's problems ,they were still there....I have gained confidence,my respect,my health ,and gained some great friends.....
I have started volunteering soo much more at the boys schools, something I have previously refused to do because I wouldn't be able to smoke and was afraid of having to be too close to other parents and teachers cos they would smell the smoke off me and I was soo ashamed of smoking, I would die if they had said anything to me about it, Have to make a load of Halloween treats and help sell them on Friday for a bake sale at James school, normally I'd not offer to help but now I'm Happy to do it and my son is delighted, he really wanted me to go to the party  and sell the cakes (apparently cos the cake sellers get to bring home all the leftovers so thats why he wants me there lll) Less time is wasted, more motivated to get out more with kids and hubby, more confidence, alot more calmer, I hated when we were out for the day and I kept trying to find excuses to disappear for a smoke and getting all angsty and stressed wanting one that I'd end up always getting everyone to leave earlier just because I wanted a stupid bloody cigarette.Fedl very guilty when i think of all the day outs I've ruined on my family because I choose cigarettes over my babies fun ; (Never ever again will I pick cigs over my family,  now we go out it's for the whole day and I get to enjoy every second of it :)

I used to have digestive issues.  I will not explain any further then that.... but had no idea that it had to do with smoking.  I can actually eat and run now... fun.
FREEDOM - confidence and pride - huge for me. But in pure pragmatic terms... I used to smoke 30 or so a day. (Peaked at 60 per day, but had settled into 30 for the last few years.) I did not some in my house - I had to go outside.I did not smoke in my office - I had to go to the smoking area. Cigarette + Transit time = say 10 minutes.30 times 10300 minutes FIVE HOURS!!!!! Five hours every day of every week of every month of every year...imagine of you could bill that time back to the tobacco companies....
there are too many to list...because even today, after 2 years, I still am surprised to discover yet again..another benefit of quitting smoking. I think if I had to choose....it would be the realization that I can do anything I set my mind to. I am stronger than I think I am...and that One Day at a Time thing isn't just a saying...but a way to live. :)
The most obvious thing that comes to mind is I don't have that constant looming feeling that I've done something wrong.  I knew I shouldn't have been smoking but continued anyway just like the typical nicotine junkie.  Yesterday is gone so today I'm content.  I wish I could go back in time and not ever smoked but what's the point of even pondering that nonsense?  What's done is done and from here on out, I only feel good about my decision keep nicotine as far away from me as I can.

AND.... (from me, the vain one)  You begin losing that smoker's "hue".  Your skin, hair, teeth, face, posture look healthier and happier.  Unexpected benefit for sure!!!  :)

I agree with everything that has been said...the confidence is wonderful.  Also, I am amazed at the financial benefits...I've saved almost $4500 not smoking, and recently learned I will be saving $600 more a year on  my life insurance premiums!  It is all good!!
A bit late but here´s my reply. To be honest I didn´t know how many things would change now that I don´t smoke. I knew I would have more money and feel better and all those things but I didn´t knew is a gateway to getting healthier in other ways. I started exercising, caring more about what I eat (I´ve always been too conscious of calories and that kind of stuff but now I care of the quality and nutrients of food) and taking care of myself in general. The smelling better issue! When I smoked I didn´t realize how disgusting the smell is! The QuitTrain was also an unexpected great surprise. This isn´t just another quit smoking forum, but a family. I´ve made great friends and I know I´m never lonely anymore. Finally, where it all started. I definitely sleep better now! Love my smoke free life!  -Nat 
There are so many things that have improved since I quit smoking - I didn't realise it at the time, but smoker action was a selfish jerk!  Smoking, or planning my next smoke was always the most important thing there was... Now I spend more time thinking about important things like my family, my career and my well being.  I honestly just didn't think life could Beas good as it is now.   Oh, and I saved a butt-load of cash, too!
    Quitting,  along with a realized inner strength, has boosted my compassion.  Always a helpful trait.
    bumpity bump bump       Please add to this great thread !
I discovered I had much more energy. I started exercising and I’ve lost 8 kilo since I’d quit. I’ve become better to work according to the plan and I don’t give new things up so easily. Still having confidence issues but depressive episodes are much shorter now.
Nice thread, so bumpbump.       Only in for 5+ weeks, but one fast and very unexpected benefit for me is the way my mental well being is catching up with my physical vitality.     For the past 5 weeks I've been reading and writing and walking and learning new things  (like practising giqong,  eating with chopsticks, replacing cigarets for just a few minutes of self investigation when I had an urge). Apparantly I really am making new pathways up there!         My biggest concern when I quit was about panick attacks/dissociation and depression. I truly feared these and can honestly say they worried me much more than any physical illness smoking would give me. Have had to battle them all my life and I know how close to complete misery  they have brought me before and I just was. Not. Going. To. Go. There. Anymore. Not after everything I've done to learn to deal with them.       And here I am. Almost six weeks in. Had my moments of anxiety and I'm sure they will come again.  I'ts just nowhere near what I expected, it ACTUALLY got better! Whoah!!  Edited October 1, 2018 by My life, my recovery
    It's often the case that the anticipation of what "might happen" is worse than what actually does happen after we quit. It's not unusual to be surprised, and pleased, when this happens  Understanding the addiction and focusing on the benefits you start seeing rather than the misery of early quit days helps a lot!

Amazing, you will have many more unexpected benefits.... Enjoy them all!!
    I am early on of course. But the rewards this quit have been NOTHING short of amazing !  No clue why this time and not the other times i tried...its so awesome  The extra time, the not stinking, the not freaking planning my day around smoking. The ease, the confidence, the savings...of health and money...the list goes on and on....I am just so damn happy !!!!!   
1 hour ago, Parsley said:               I am ﻿just so damn happy !!!!!          I've always loved my quit!! Keep that with you; even when nothing else is going right, you can find happiness and motivation there.     Confidence is the #1. I thought I had it before but I've learned I used smoking as a way to remain antisocial and unapproachable. (I guess holding on to that 15yr old tough girl attitude)Now, I have no problem taking the middle seat at the dr office or standing close to the other moms at the book fair. #2 Happiness. Truly being happy for myself was foreign before my quit. I had to light a cigarette to tell me to be happy. Never again.  #3 There is a new closeness in my family because we aren't missing moments for cigarettes. I learned how to ask for help.   I could write a book. I love the new non-smoking me!
Amen! I didn't love the first 20 days. But ditto the rest.  I guess I thought in the earlier quits...that I had to suffer, be miserable, feel slighted, annoyed, pissed, sad on and on.....crap out and buy cigs and give up. Repeat.   But I stayed here after last failure over a year ago and here I am...a happy quitter....first couple weeks not awesome. I am not Mary Poppins.....but here I am....loving my quit!!!    Sooooo....never give up quitting..
    Not having to ask the kid for a hug and a kiss goodnight... she just does it because I don't stink anymore.... love that the most.
    The circulation around my ankles was noticeable... Very early in my quit...almost instant...the heavy dull ache/pain had subsided.heaps...  I still get blown away when I another benieft moment... Simple thing,s...taking a big deep smell of the aroma of my brother,s beautiful rose,s.....my nose was dead....

    Time to revisit this positive thread.   What are the ways quitting smoking has affected your life ?
    Just not having to worry about the whole damn smoking routine and everything that's connected to it. Smoking ran my entire day to day life. Now, it's just not part of my life at all. In fact, it's hard for me to imagine myself as a smoker now. That's a good thing  
My life has changed in so many ways ....    I was in constant state of worry.....   Have I got enough smokes ....   Is there anywhere to smoke ...  It totally ruled my life ....   Will I die a smoker...it goes on and on ....    I just carnt picture me puffing on a ciggy now.... I would be physically ill....    And there says ..A 52 year smoker ... unbelievable...!!!
    I have gained a lot of knowledge in the neuroscience field. I am way more talkative (which is a good thing in my case)  My house is clean because I don't use my "need a smoke break" as distraction    Less distraction in general Less air and environmental polution!         
    The last weekend was a billion percent stressful for a variety of reasons. However, the strange thing is that it didn't cross my mind at any time to have a cig. It's not that I had to fight an urge, I just didn't think about them. I can only put it down to my no option situation. That has really done it for me.    I'm not complacent though, I know how the monster works. I realise that the demon is just trying another tactic with me so I'm on guard against the trickery.
    So sorry you had a stressful weekend, but how great that you didn't have to fight the urge to light up! Always great to be on guard, though. For sure.
    Sorry about your rough weekend but I'm very happy you were not tempted to light up.  That's awesome.
    Aww sorry you had a bad time ...you didn't think of smoking ..  Well done ...this can be tough ......but you came through strong .. Hope things improve for you MB....   
    Sorry for your stress Phil, and happy for you that smoking wasn't an option. Well done! 
    Well done all mighty!! Sorry bout the stress :s
    You've taken smoking off the table and realize that smoking is not some magic cure for stress.      It is always encouraging to see quitters address the big issues early in the process.       You are building a mighty quit for yourself Mr. Boosh.  Good job.
    You Quit Smoking, Mighty One !      Congratulations to you.     Stay vigilant and focused.  Nicotine has nothing for you, never had, never will.    Freedom.  Freedom.  Freedom.
I had a really stressful time about 6 weeks into my quit that really tested me. That was the last really big test for me. I mean, I had urges and what not after that but no real close call. You got through it and that alone will be there for you to call on in future. It's a good thing!! Sucks to have stress in your life but great to know you can get through it without even thinking about smoking - that's the silver lining to your dark cloud
    Oh Mightyboosh, stressful days do creep in on occasion.  Feel so proud you did not think to smoke.  You are getting more powerful every day.  I do hope tomorrow will be much better! 
    Well done on not smoking.       Stress is the main excuse everyone uses to light up but you stayed smoke free.      Go and treat yourself to something - definitely deserved.

What are some other excuses to smoke? Excuses to smokeJUNKIE THINKING: “One Puff won’t hurt”RESPONSE: “One puff will always hurt me, and it always will because I’m not a social smoker. One puff and I’ll be smoking compulsively again.” JUNKIE THINKING: “I only want one.”RESPONSE: “I have never wanted only one. In fact, I want 20-30 a day every day. I want them all.” JUNKIE THINKING: “I’ll just be a social smoker.”RESPONSE: “I’m a chronic, compulsive smoker, and once I smoke one I’ll quickly be thinking about the next one. Social smokers can take it or leave it. That’s not me.” JUNKIE THINKING: “I’m doing so well, one won’t hurt me now.”RESPONSE: “The only reason I’m doing so well is because I haven’t taken the first one. Yet once I do, I won’t be doing well anymore. I’ll be smoking again.” JUNKIE THINKING: “I’ll just stop again.”RESPONSE: “Sounds easy, but who am I trying to kid? Look how long it too me to stop this time. And once I start, how long will it take before I get sick enough to face withdrawal again? In fact, when I’m back in the grip of compulsion, what guarantee do I have that I’ll ever be able to stop again?” JUNKIE THINKING: “If I slip, I’ll keep trying.”RESPONSE: “If I think I can get away with one little “slip” now I’ll think I can get away with another little “slip” later on.” JUNKIE THINKING: “I need one to get me through this withdrawal.”RESPONSE: “Smoking will not get me through the discomfort of not smoking. I will only get me back to smoking. One puff stops the process of withdrawal and I’ll have to go through it all over again.” JUNKIE THINKING: “I miss smoking right now.”RESPONSE: “Of course I miss something I’ve been doing every day for most of my life. Bud do I miss the chest pain right now? Do I miss the worry, the embarrassment? I’d rather be an ex-smoker with an occasional desire to smoke, than a smoker with a constant desire to stop doing it.” JUNKIE THINKING: “I really need to smoke now, I’m so upset.”RESPONSE: “Smoking is not going to fix anything. I’ll still be upset, I’ll just be an upset smoker. I never have to have a cigarette. Smoking is not a need; it’s a want. Once the crisis is over, I’ll be relieved and grateful I’m still not smoking.” JUNKIE THINKING: “I don’t care.”RESPONSE: “What is it exactly that I think that I don’t care about? Can I truthfully say I don’t care about chest pain? I don’t care about gagging in the morning? I don’t care about lung cancer? No, I care about these things very much. That’s why I stopped smoking in the first place.” JUNKIE THINKING: “What difference does it make, anyway?”RESPONSE: “It makes a difference in the way I breathe, the way my heart beats, the way I feel about myself. It makes a tremendous difference in every aspect of my physical and emotional health.”http://www.quitsmokinghelp.ca/mustread/junkiethinking.html

JUNKIE THINKING: " I'm not an addict ”RESPONSE: Yes.  You are.   Easy Peasy
I LOVE this MQ. So true. I especially love this: I’d rather be an ex-smoker with an occasional desire to smoke, than a smoker with a constant desire to stop doing it Yes, I would rather deal with the temporary withdrawal than ever smoke again! Blowing your quit is not worth it!
A great reminder.....my junkie brain found any excuse to smoke.......
Oh my. I think I sabotaged my previous quits with all of those.  Before I understood this addiction. Now, every now and again I think about it, but I can honestly say I can't REMEMBER exactly how it felt to smoke.  I honestly can't.   I just tried and it's gone.  And good riddance!
 I can't REMEMBER exactly how it felt to smokeCongratulations. You have arrived at The Destination.   Easy Peasy
JUNKIE THINKING: " I'm not an addict ”RESPONSE: Yes.  You are.Easy PeasyThis is, by far, the HARDEST one for me to accept.   I hate that word being applicable to describe any part of my being.  To me, it's a sign of weakness.  Something I can't control.  And that's not acceptable to me.  I went to New Orleans the other day and I could see the junkies sitting on the street.  One looked like he had inhaled far too many cans of paint.  And I thought, that's not me.  I'm not like that AT ALL.  I am coming to terms that it could actually be me.  Cigarettes are legal.  If they weren't , what would I do to get one ?  I think I would have done just about anything....... I don't know.  I still have a hard time with calling myself an addict.  
Calling me weak......ok. Stubborn, hard headed.....ok An addict......that's to the core
Say it with The Sarge, Tiff : " I am an addict " Say it every day. Out loud.    Easy Peasy
You know what, Tiffany?  When my Dr. called me an addict I was pissed.  He wasn't buying what I was selling and laughed when I asked him if he was serious when he called me an addict.  How ignorant I was. Once I accepted that I was a nicotine addict and would be for the rest of my life, it became okay for me to think about smoking.  Thinking about smoking and wanting to smoke is different for me.  I think about smoking everyday but I don't want to smoke everyday.
IM GONNA PRINT THIS ! AND PUT ON MY BED ROOM THANKS
Bump
It is so true!
Truly agreed...

Topical.

Topical. Can you please elaborate on this ?  ^^^^^ It's the same issue that always repeats itself.  Perhaps this is the tree in the road that stops Tiffany from taking this to the next level.  What do you think, Tiffany?My thoughts ?  I don't understand why we have to keep discussing this.   Ok, I'm not the junkie sitting on the side of the road in NOLA.   The tree sitting in the road was my refusal (remember, it's a choice) to quit smoking.  This does not qualify me as an addict.  Nor does it you.  But if it works for you to call yourself that, then by all means, do what works for you. I'm not going to try to convince you that you're not.  Just don't smoke.   But I will say this..... I will NEVER address on here if I'm struggling again.  Because all you're going to do is tell me I'm struggling cause I refuse to admit that I am some sort of addict in denial.  It can't be something as simple as I am addicted to nicotine and still trying to process through it.  No, it has to be that I HAVE TO HAVE A LABEL ON MY HEAD.  And somehow, this label will take away any struggle I am going through.  I call BULLSHIT.   EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I smoked, I made that CHOICE.   My thoughts.   And obviously, it's going to be an ongoing thing to change them.  So I get to choose on here if I want to label myself as an addict or sit back and let y'all label me as hard headed, stubborn or an addict in denial.   Do what y'all need to do. Oh and by the way MQ, I thought I was taking it to the next level.  I haven't smoked.
Can you please elaborate on this ? ^^^^^ My thoughts ? I don't understand why we have to keep discussing this.   It is topical because we spent two pages talking about Addict and Addiction on your thread.This sent me searching for posts about Addiction, Junkie Thoughts, etc.  so I could learn more. You will see that I bumped a few threads that were relevant to the subject. This is not just about you, Tiffany.  It is about the whole subject of Addiction, a discussion essential in dealing with an addictive substance.Opening up the conversation separate from your quitting thread may be helpful to everybody. S
That's fair.   Thank you. I may have taken it personally cause we just had this same conversation on another thread.   I apologize for that.  
I'm not intentionally dogging you around. 
Tiffany I do hope you call out, on here, if you have a day where it feels a struggle. Remember not everyone thinks you have to have the addict label, before you can have a successful quit..I'm living proof that theory is tosh. All you have to do is what you're doing, not smoking, so you're no longer a smoker anymore...twenty two days you've been doing that..rinse and repeat.
I assume we all can agree with the Fact that Nicotine is an Addictive substanceHere is The American Society of Addiction Medicine's definition of addiction from their website.  ASAM  "Short Definition of Addiction:Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry. Dysfunction in these circuits leads to characteristic biological, psychological, social and spiritual manifestations. This is reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by substance use and other behaviors.Addiction is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one’s behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and remission. Without treatment or engagement in recovery activities, addiction is progressive and can result in disability or premature death. Long Definition of Addiction:Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry. Addiction affects neurotransmission and interactions within reward structures of the brain, including the nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, basal forebrain and amygdala, such that motivational hierarchies are altered and addictive behaviors, which may or may not include alcohol and other drug use, supplant healthy, self-care related behaviors. Addiction also affects neurotransmission and interactions between cortical and hippocampal circuits and brain reward structures, such that the memory of previous exposures to rewards (such as food, sex, alcohol and other drugs) leads to a biological and behavioral response to external cues, in turn triggering craving and/or engagement in addictive behaviors.The neurobiology of addiction encompasses more than the neurochemistry of reward.1 The frontal cortex of the brain and underlying white matter connections between the frontal cortex and circuits of reward, motivation and memory are fundamental in the manifestations of altered impulse control, altered judgment, and the dysfunctional pursuit of rewards (which is often experienced by the affected person as a desire to “be normal”) seen in addiction--despite cumulative adverse consequences experienced from engagement in substance use and other addictive behaviors. The frontal lobes are important in inhibiting impulsivity and in assisting individuals to appropriately delay gratification. When persons with addiction manifest problems in deferring gratification, there is a neurological locus of these problems in the frontal cortex. Frontal lobe morphology, connectivity and functioning are still in the process of maturation during adolescence and young adulthood, and early exposure to substance use is another significant factor in the development of addiction. Many neuroscientists believe that developmental morphology is the basis that makes early-life exposure to substances such an important factor.Genetic factors account for about half of the likelihood that an individual will develop addiction. Environmental factors interact with the person’s biology and affect the extent to which genetic factors exert their influence. Resiliencies the individual acquires (through parenting or later life experiences) can affect the extent to which genetic predispositions lead to the behavioral and other manifestations of addiction. Culture also plays a role in how addiction becomes actualized in persons with biological vulnerabilities to the development of addiction.Other factors that can contribute to the appearance of addiction, leading to its characteristic bio-psycho-socio-spiritual manifestations, include:The presence of an underlying biological deficit in the function of reward circuits, such that drugs and behaviors which enhance reward function are preferred and sought as reinforcers;The repeated engagement in drug use or other addictive behaviors, causing neuroadaptation in motivational circuitry leading to impaired control over further drug use or engagement in addictive behaviors;Cognitive and affective distortions, which impair perceptions and compromise the ability to deal with feelings, resulting in significant self-deception;Disruption of healthy social supports and problems in interpersonal relationships which impact the development or impact of resiliencies;Exposure to trauma or stressors that overwhelm an individual’s coping abilities;Distortion in meaning, purpose and values that guide attitudes, thinking and behavior;Distortions in a person’s connection with self."

One puff and I’ll be smoking compulsively again.”                          JUNKIE THINKING: “I only want one.”         RESPONSE: “I have never wanted only one. In fact, I want 20-30 a day every day. I want them all.”                           JUNKIE THINKING: “I’ll just be a social smoker.”            RESPONSE: “I’m a chronic, compulsive smoker, and once I smoke one I’ll quickly be thinking about the next one. Social smokers can take it or leave it. That’s not me.”                          JUNKIE THINKING: “I’m doing so well, one won’t hurt me now.”            RESPONSE: “The only reason I’m doing so well is because I haven’t taken the first one. Yet once I do, I won’t be doing well anymore. I’ll be smoking again.”                            JUNKIE THINKING: “I’ll just stop again.”            RESPONSE: “Sounds easy, but who am I trying to kid? Look how long it too me to stop this time. And once I start, how long will it take before I get sick enough to face withdrawal again? In fact, when I’m back in the grip of compulsion, what guarantee do I have that I’ll ever be able to stop again?”                         JUNKIE THINKING: “If I slip, I’ll keep trying.”         RESPONSE: “If I think I can get away with one little “slip” now I’ll think I can get away with another little “slip” later on.”                         JUNKIE THINKING: “I need one to get me through this withdrawal.”            RESPONSE: “Smoking will not get me through the discomfort of not smoking. I will only get me back to smoking. One puff stops the process of withdrawal and I’ll have to go through it all over again.”                          JUNKIE THINKING: “I miss smoking right now.”            RESPONSE: “Of course I miss something I’ve been doing every day for most of my life. Bud do I miss the chest pain right now? Do I miss the worry, the embarrassment? I’d rather be an ex-smoker with an occasional desire to smoke, than a smoker with a constant desire to stop doing it.”                         JUNKIE THINKING: “I really need to smoke now, I’m so upset.”            RESPONSE: “Smoking is not going to fix anything. I’ll still be upset, I’ll just be an upset smoker. I never have to have a cigarette. Smoking is not a need; it’s a want.

It makes a tremendous difference in every aspect of my physical and emotional health.”      http://www.quitsmokinghelp.ca/mustread/junkiethinking.html       This whole thread is interesting, how we face reality and admit that we are nicotine addicts.For some, this admission is more difficult than for others.    I was in complete denial about addiction for the 40 something years of smoking.It was only just before I quit that I flirted with calling myself a junkie.'I'm going outside to shoot up', I would say as a quasi joke but, Deep Down, I knew.After I quit and educated myself here and there, denial was visible and ridiculous.   Another post that addresses our 'junkie thinking' Red Flags.
Dishonesty is the #1 impediment to success in quitting.     Every one of those Junkie Thoughts is dishonest. Most rising to the level of Outright Lies.     First and foremost under the Dishonesty Banner for most folks? Denial.  We all know the facts here.     We knew them all along.     We chose willful Denial.        **      Sarge is wagering that she never successfully quit.     EZPZ

I know a lot of people have had insomnia kick in when quitting smoking.  It didn't for me, I was able to use sleep to escape some triggers/cravesbut, for those who are having this issue, here is our friend, Joel, addressing the issue.I would also suggest using simple remedies like meditation, chamomile tea, turning off screens prior to bedtime etc.   Have y'all any tips about putting yourselves to sleep ?     Video describes how sleep may become disrupted in the first days of nicotine withdrawal but will eventually return to a normal pattern.         Sleep AdjustmentsSleep can get pretty disruptive the first few days. Some people will get very little sleep, waking up every hour or not sleeping at all yet not feel tired.Others can sleep 20 hours a day and be exhausted during their waking hours.     Whichever way it goes, sleep will adjust itself when you quit and eventually go back to normal.But there is a catch. You don't know what normal is. Normal is what it was prior to being a smoker with aging thrown in. Some people have not been normal for decades.   Nicotine is a stimulant drug that once it wore off threw the smoker into a physiologically depressed state.To overcome this depressant effect the smoker would smoke again to stimulate him or herself. Soon it would wear off and the endless cycle would be repeated over and over.Blood sugar and hormone levels would skyrocket, only to come crashing down later. By the end of the day the smoker could be physically exhausted from this chronic stimulant/depressant roller coaster.They had to adjust their sleep around these effects.    Without this chronic abuse, these ex-smokers may find that they can get by on less sleep after they quit smoking,sometimes knocking out hours of what they thought was needed sleep time.   Others only minimize sleep by a short time period but it is very obvious when the alarm goes off they can jump out of bed full of energy and ready to go, or sometimes even wake up before the alarm with newfound energy. When they were smokers they were often exhausted upon waking, hating the alarm and needing cigarettes to pick them up and get them going.    There are a smaller number of people who need more sleep when they are ex-smokers. These are people who often smoked heavily at the tail end of their days. Their bodies were crying for sleep but they kept pumping nicotine into their system to override the body's need.Without nicotine as a constant stimulant, they now have to listen to their bodies and go to bed when tired.     They could take speed and get the same effects but normally realize that they wouldn't resort to a drug for this effect, yet they can rationalize that smoking was suitable for the exact same purpose.Well it wasn't. The schedule they were maintaining had a price attached and the long range cost for this "benefit" could be death.   Anyway, don't panic by the amount of sleep you get for the first few days.It is not your normal amount of sleep as an ex-smoker, it is your normal amount of sleep while in drug withdrawal. These are not "normal" times, nor will they last long. Anyone experiencing such problems the first week or two after quitting probably is likely just having adjustment issues.    But, a health care professional should evaluate disruptions lasting longer, especially beyond a month. Many other causes can be responsible for such disruptions including physical, psychological, medication reactions, etc.Blaming such symptoms of sleep disruption on quitting smoking for a few days in most cases is probably justified, but at longer periods the ex-smoker needs to be more objective and getting a professional medical evaluation is then warranted.     Sleep will eventually settle in to a normal pattern for you as an ex-smoker. Then aging will exert its normal adjustments. Whether it turns out to be more sleep or less, you should at least sleep sounder knowing you are no longer under the control of nicotine and no longer posing such deadly risks to yourself by still smoking.    To sleep happier because you know you are staying healthier and likely to live longer,always remember all the times you are awake to Never Take Another Puff!

    I'm in a lot of pain today. A lot. My autoimmune disease is kicking my arse. But you know what's helping me get through it?     - You people    - Spanking the sticks on Chicks or Sticks   - Ginger ale (for the stomach discomfort)   - Coffee (for the fatigue)  - Ibuprofen - My dogs   - Sunshine coming in my office window   - Comfy, soft pajama pants      Do you know what I'm not doing to help me get through it?   - Smoking       My life is scary right now, and many of my days are filled with extreme discomfort. And yes, there are times when my brain whispers to me, "Just light up. The dopamine rush will make you feel better." But I don't. I resist. And I use the tools I have available to me to distract myself. And pretty soon I can't hear those whispers anymore.     If I can do it, you can do it.      Just don't smoke.    
    I am SO glad you are here, Abby and so sorry you are not feeling well.      You are right, you won't be hearing 'those whispers'  after a while.    Get your dopamine from breathing beautiful deep clean breaths and give yourself rewards and LOTS of them !  You are doing so great and your posts are so important.     Also, it is GREAT spanking The Sticks...that never gets old.
    Sorry about your rough day Abby, I hope you start feeling better soon. Thank you for posting this to show others that nothing is worth losing your quit over, xoxo
    The one good thing is that really bad days are often followed by much better days. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow. :-)
    Sorry you are suffering today Abby. As you say ..... tomorrow will be better - brighter - filled with positive thoughts 
    Yes there can be some rough days but it seems like you have built up quite an arsenal of tools to help you maintain the quit.  Also those whispers become even more quiet over time.  Way to keep strong!!!!

No more constant congestion and that irritating cough...
You can smell...for the most part this is a good one.  But if your SO still smokes, maybe not.  Seriously, I might sleep on the couch tonight!   :huh:
No more guilt
More timeLess stressSmell niceSmell and Taste betterMore energyMaking positive changesmore moneyfeel fitter and healthierdo not feel like an outcast at social eventsno guilt - good one MQmet you bunch of lovely/crazy people
I'm Hella cooler smoke free.  B)
No more burning holes in my clothes, and no more oh schlitz, panic, did it go in the back seat.
No more stank breath for others to breathe as I talk to them. I can smell the shampoo in my hair when the wind blows.  lol
No more shame. I used to feel SO embarrassed that I smoked. There were people in my life who I hid it from on the daily. Glad I no longer have to hide anything. Also, I was an idiot... they knew I smoked all along, or at least had suspicions that I did. They could smell it on my clothes and breath!
My deep breath is 4 times deeper than my smoking deep breath - I love this!Sense of smell (mostly good apart from bad smells also more noticable lol)Food taste - wow!!Sense of being able to achieve things - massive increase!!Inspiring those I love to try, makes my heart happy. I love not smoking even though my brain occasionally tries to trick me that I might.
Empowerment
Being able to kiss my boyfriend without him telling me I taste like an ashtray!
Biggest benefit for me:  freedom from slavery of nicotine addiction.  Small benefit:  I just noticed this morning when I switched purses.  It was the first time I didn't have to take it outside and dump all the loose tobacco out of it. :).  Even almost 2 years later the benefits still come....no matter how big or small.

Your head clears from the smoke in your brain and you think better! You start using that brain again and think what the heck did I smoke for in the fist place! I think you make better decisions and know what you want and do it. Energy - Off the scales, getting twice the work done without being tired!
I am so  made up that I am free I notice something every day. Today it's pouring down and I no longer need to dart to the garage, to scratch my itch/smoke, and get soaking wet.
When I fill out a survey that asks if Im a smoker.......I can check the little box that says non-smoker and declare loudly "I aint no stinky smoker!"
Waking up refreshed and ready to start the day! No more dark circles under my eyes!
Healthier, Fitter, Funner.... Sexier... No..... really!
Healthier, Fitter, Funner.... Sexier... No..... really! So is that picture of you in your avatar before or after you quit smoking?
Self Esteem.
Not feeling ashamed and embarrassed when I snuck out for a cigarette while dining in a restaurant with non-smoking friends.  Not feeling dirty and disgusting when a non-smoker got in my car.  Having no need to justify spending money on little extras for myself.  I will never again pull my car over in a panic because I'm afraid that the butt I was tossing out the window landed in the backseat and 5k down the road I'll be on fire. No more looking foolish at the side of the road searching for the butt that might or might not be in the back seat.
Waking up without a nagging cough. 
Today's benefit for me..... As I no longer spend £64 a week, on the muck, I suprised and treated my daughters to £20 each to take on their shopping trip with their pals. Felt so good to know that money will go towards fun instead of death. They will have a ball!
No persistent cough,  wheezing, better health in general, more energy, stamina, lung capacity so you can be more physically active,  no stale cigarette smell everywhere, no ciggie burns on clothes, furniture,  car seats etc,  No constant fear that "it's too late " and that you already have gotten a horrible smoking related disease, no driving to the gas station in the middle of the night, being able to enjoy all kinds of activities without disruption, being less anxious, stressed and angry, more peaceful,  an improved life in every way because once you quit you start caring about your health more,  and yourself.
No more stank breath for others to breathe as I talk to them. I can smell the shampoo in my hair when the wind blows.  lol Yes! I love the smelling my hair part. Mmm
So is that picture of you in your avatar before or after you quit smoking?That my ***** Cat friend is Before... The After is just too hot... for here.  (I am actually Actions Fatter funnier brother.... ;) )
Today's benefit for me.... Husband has just mowed the lawn, the smell....just beautiful.
Not having to desperately count money in hopes of having enough for a pack of cigs!
I don't have cold hands or feet anymore....I just noticed that the other day and it surprised me. I always had cold hands and feet, even in summer....that was a big eye opener!
Got rid of the nasty throat clearing thing I had to do all the time! I was a major closet smoker, if I were out & about town, I would have to drive and go find some hiding place to smoke.  PA-thetic!!!  I was constantly afraid I would see someone I knew.   No more rushing to get home so I could smoke in the dark cold smelly garage and "enjoy" (not) my smoke in peace.  
Nobody has called me "sir" on the phone--for the past year and a half 
Nobody has called me "sir" on the phone--for the past year and a halfLol...that made be laugh. I have just to do my Bonnie Tyler number on our karaoke nights...betting I will now be pants, just ain't got the voice anymore...lol...
I am a person that laughs a lot... it's awesome to laugh without starting to cough up a lung 5 seconds later :)
Hahaha....watched a girl light a cigarette outside the restaurant I was leaving.I think she was using one of those cheepie imitation bic lighters....the flame went so big she singed her bangs. So glad that will never be me again. :)
No more lighting the filter end by mistake...GAWD that would taste horrible
That was the worst Jengelsnew! God, I remember that taste... gag. When I used to smoke in a car or vehicle of any kind, we'd throw the ashes into a water bottle or can.  No more accidentally drinking from that bottle/can!  GAG. 
I will get to spend more time with my children. And they won't have to change my diaper cause I've had a debilitating heart attack or a stroke.   Don't misunderstand me.....I'm still gonna make em change my diaper.  But because I'm mean like that. Not because I decided to kill myself slowly.
noe more coughing.
Benefits after Five years ?     Continued improvements in breathing and skin tone, taste and scent also, heart and circulation. My flu or colds do not degenerate into bronchitis.  I have no cough.        I never think about smoking anymore.    I may have a vague memory,  'oh, I used to smoke during moments like this'      but, this is without temptation or desire.      As the years go by, I am prouder and prouder of myself for dealing successfully with my nicotine addiction  and have greater compassion for those still in the throes of addiction.  Edited February 11 by Sazerac

    bump
I've been successfully quit for well over 7 years and it's safe to say I am very  good. I will never smoke again, I have no desire to, no cravings or no active thoughts about it.      Every now and then I still have dreams where I smoke. I always feel really guilty about blowing my quit during the dream after I've already smoked. Or sometimes I'm confused as to why am I holding this lit cigarette in my hand. These dreams are usually followed by an extreme state of panic/confusion upon waking up about whether I've a) messed up my quit and smoked b) ever actually been quit for this long or if it's all a sham       I'm always extremely relieved when my brain catches up and I realise it was just a dream and I've actually not smoked in all this time. This probably tells me how I'd feel if I relapsed.
    This quit is too fresh for smokers dreams. But I do recognise it from my last quit a few years back. I was on a dutch forum and I dreamed my whole group was lighting cigarettes and I was frantically trying to get rid of the cigarettes. Pleading and trying to convince them not to smoke.  I have never met the ppl in real life, but somehow my mind had put faces to the nicknames.  I also had those dreams where I was lighting a cigarette and after that waking up in complete panic that I threw away my quit.  So yeah I can relate 
Yes,  i have had dreams before about smoking cigarettes , i was feeling really bad about it and then i woke up and was happy to know that it was just a dream . I read an article few days ago and it says that people sleeping under cold conditions  have the chances of nightmares than people sleeping under warm conditions .  They even say that people having a deep sleep under warm conditions could see more better dreams .Edited October 10 by Sunshine59

They are less frequent now for sure but they still do happen after all this time. Even at the start I was always relieved when I woke up that I hadn't really smoked and I remember being annoyed and confused at myself for smoking in the dream in the first place.        Goes to show how strong the addiction is when even now I sometimes have these dreams and I'm far along in my quit.
    I've had those dreams from time to time as well. They don't really bother me. I guess it's because it was only a dream and not real life. I imagine we'll probably have these from time to time for the rest of our lives just as I suspect I'll get an occasional crave for the rest of my life too.

For me they feel very real at the time when they happen and I'm always confused for a while upon waking up as to whether I've really smoked or not. Always great to realise it was only a dream!
    Yes.  Weird is it not?  I can’t remember dreaming about smoking when I was a smoker, or, maybe I did but didn’t classify it as an important part to remember because it was normal for me to smoke.     Now as a non-smoker it is NOT normal for me to be smoking, so, I have a guilt trip in the dream and always remember when I wake up
    I've not had a smoking dream.  Is it just the act itself or do you get the taste and smell too.

Surviving The Great Smoke Free Fog      Some people experience a mental fog soon after they quit smoking, others don't. It can last from a few hours to a few weeks or longer.  My fog wasn't consistent, showing  up unannounced and somewhat dismaying.   Who am I kidding ?  It was disarming and seemed impenetrable.   I couldn't have made thoughtful decisions and was glad they weren't necessary.      My fog lasted over a month and lingered far too long.   Not what you want to hear, I know,  but remember, this was only my experience.  Everyone's quit is unique, much has to do with attitude, general wellness, behavior/lifestyle, nutrition... Keep some tricks in your tool box to help you, just in case, and keep your blood sugar up.      Antidotes ?     forced walks, cold air, intentional breathing, too much coffee,     'embracing the suck', attention to my blood sugar,  alerting people that might be affected, not stressing out about it...understanding that it will pass.       Duration and Density ?  On a scale, (10) drastically impaired to (0) normal.        -For three days, with OTC help and Whisky,  I  flirted with informal catatonia   (10)       -For two weeks, I had little concentration, I wasn't making executive decisions or problem solving  (7)         -At four weeks, I slowly wakened to lethargy (3) and indolence (2.5)        -It tapered off so  s l o w l y,  it was hard to mark but, that could have been my inattentiveness. pfftt.           Have you experienced The Great Smoke Free Fog ? What helped you ? How dense was it ? When did it clear ?       Enjoy this lovely short film and listen to Sounding the Sumburgh Foghorn in The Shetlands.   Edited May 4, 2018 by Sazerac
    I'm still in the fog myself.  Thank you for sharing - I'm intrigued by informal catatonia.  Preferred poison would be wine, but the numbing outcome would be the same.  
    Mine was about like what you describe Saz! It was by far and away the most debilitating and longest lasting quit symptom I experienced. I felt pretty much useless for a month or more

The fog for me seemed to last for a long time. I'm certain it must have been improving bit by bit over the period, but I think marked improvement came around month three.      I may be being over dramatic, but that is how it has felt at least. I reckon I'm in a better place now than I was at the start of my quit. The slavery to the addiction had become pretty debilitating. I'm certain there is still more to come though. This makes me happy.        Whoops forgot about how it improved. I think the longer I've been able to go without thinking of a cigarette the better my concentration has got on other things.

Well Saz much of my fog was very similar to yours though I believe it only lasted, in a strong sense of the word, a little less than 3 weeks.  It took another couple of weeks to completely wave it off.  Luckily I am retired so it did not affect me in making decisions or working.  I do agree with you that it quite disarming, something that hit me hard at first and did not expect.

I got a double dip into the land of fog... when I initially quit that first 2 weeks was a nightmare... If I couldn't be doing a repetitive task at work that was the same thing over and over and didn't require independent thought I may as well not have been there... so many boring tasks I usually put off were done the first 2 weeks... then I oscillated between the fog and moments of lucidity as the thought of smoking took up less of my time... and then... my world got tilted on its axis, majorly, twice in the space of 2 days .... and I had to be strong and present and there for a lot of people who mean shit to me and I didn't have time to dwell in the fog, or think about having a smoke, I had big time shit to deal with and I just couldn't indulge the fog... I think subconsciously I was treading water furiously to hold my head above the frickin fog but it had to be done and it was... and I was back to normal (well my version of normal) most of the time... much less crazy random thoughts now than earlier in my quit (or maybe I'm just not sharing)... I mean who spends there spare time plotting their countries ascent to the world super power (although how awesome would the world be if Straya ran it)... ok back on track, talking about the fog... so my second dip into the land of fog came when I quit the NRT gum... that was a fun little time for us all wasn't it... mental breakdowns over, oh, just about everything... but the fog came back... and this time I was more prepared for it... and I had the awesome train gang to help out but I controlled the fog by focusing on things... if I could focus on swimming a cartoon shark around an imaginary ocean while I ate tourists and fish or if I could get into a quick flowing game of the answer is a question that went back and forth all (my) night or playing one of the silly A-Z games and trying to find the innocent sounding really rude things to post so I (and maybe a few others) knew what I was up too but no one else did.... or posting on a secret theme and wondering who else would pick up on it.... stupid, silly mindless games within games but it kept the fog minimised.... While the first week of the fog take two was probably more intense than the initial fog it was shorter lived and I saw the light much sooner and without any trauma to push it away. ...      Now the fog has cleared (get the occasional little showing for half an hour or so) for the most part and I am back, I can even multi task again... I nearly died when I realised I had lost that ability, totally shattered. But only on Friday at work was I updating spread sheets at the same time I was having a discussion on the phone with a customer and having a hand written note discussion with a co-worker about a third issue.... I am back people... I can now be crazy in three different ways simultaneously!      I do think Sslip nailed it though....the fog's impact on my life was definitely proportional to my frequency of think about the coffin nails.       I wish I had seen a post like this thread early in my quit when I thought I was going insane... SO ANY REAL NEW NEWBIES READING THIS don't let the fog scare you... there is nothing sinister in it, its not courtesy Stephen King... the fog wont hurt you.... and once you make your way out of the fog you will find yourself in the land of freedom, where the air is clear and you are the master of yourself once more.... walk through that fog, run through it or crawl, however you do it just make sure you do because it is so worth the journey... please keep on the path.  Edited May 5, 2018 by notsmokinjo
    Hmm, I think I’m still in a fog. Recently couldn’t concentrate at all!      in the first weeks of the quit i suffered from insomnia and this contributed to my state of mind(lessness) perhaps even more than lack of smoke. 
Yes i had the fog!!!        No-one really believed me about how bad it was but i seriously couldn’t think properly for a long time. I tried to avoid controversy, arguments or anything that required me to think something through rather than just lose my sh*t.      I actually still have it. It is less than 1,3,5 months ago but i still don’t think it completely gone. Moral to the story is try not to fight with me because im not quite the full quid yet. Edited May 7, 2018 by Giveintowin

    For me, the patch has taken the edge off the fog so far - but i am still putting nicotine into my body/brain; wondering what I will experience when I go off the patch completely.

I know right from the outset when I was on NRT it was there and probably worse in those early days with NRT than when I fully came of nicotine.

    Just giving this a bump for @Tammy ... you might get something out of these posts as I think you are one of us that has to face the quit fog... Its gets better just stick it out chook and you'll be having an easier time soon.
Yes Tammy. It won't last forever even though it may seem so in early days. Lots of great stories here to help you understand how others have dealt with it. I always believed that part of the problem is that not only is your body adjusting to the lack of deadly chemicals you suck in through your lungs every 30-60 minutes of each day, your brain has so much more idle time once you've quit. Just think about all the time you spent not only smoking but the things around smoking. Smoking consumed a larger portion of your thought process each day than we realize. Suddenly .... all that's just gone - no longer there so now you have to fill that void. It just takes time. Be patient and it will happen.
    Ohhh this is a great thread! First three days of quitting,  Fulltime Fog. Not making sense whatsoever, almost felt drugged. I slept like a maniac, which contributed great deal to The Fog. After that, insomnia hit. Which... ofcourse... contributed to The Fog . Now Im back to normal sleeping patterns, but still dwelling in mysty lands. I try to be comfortable with it and not expect to much of myself (except for NOT lighting up ofcourse). I think I kinda suck at my job right now, but whatever. Things will be better and I'll Shine like never before!          
As you can see from the successful quits above, the fog is not permanent.   So, cut yourself some slack, be kind to yourself    and be careful with heavy machinery, playing with knives or,                Edited January 8 by Sazerac

I'd Rather Be A Little Overweight & Not Smoking Than Underweight & Dead!Video discusses the importance of not letting the chance of gaining weight being used as an excuse for not quitting smoking or for relapsing after having quit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I3fv5EqTBU
Ha! I kinda sorta needed this I lost my 20ish quit smoking pounds.....Then backslid....and put 15 back on Uggg  I forgot to shuffle daily. (The Doritos didn't help either)
thanks for the video mq. for some reason I lose weight over the winter holidays, and then put 10-15 back on in the spring. I can lose weight over the summer and fall but right now is not good... ^_^ did I mention I don't like my treadmill? I thought I remembered reading somewhere that they are bad for you too, all of that walking in one place and so on. pff
12 lbs. gained from quitting smoking. Um, probably the Doritos caused the weight gain. Not the smoking. Haven't lost it, either, though I have been exercising more than I ever did when I smoked. However. . .walking briskly 3-4 miles a day will take a couple hundred calories off my daily intake. While, a single serving bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos contains 262 calories. At this rate, I need to start walking about 10 miles per day or cut back on the Doritos. Yeah.
Totally agree!  For years and years I struggled with my weight...up 25, down 25....and the whole time I was smoking. When I would exercise as a smoker...I would get a headache so I would quit.  Wouldn't occur to me to quit smoking...lol...I quit the exercise instead. Finally, when I quit smoking...I did gain 35 lbs...but....what followed was a wonderful journey of completely taking responsibility for my total health and well being.  I know I would still be on that up and down roller coaster of dieting, dropping in and out of routinely exercising if I hadn't quit smoking FIRST..even if it meant I gained some weight temporarily.  It was worth it..and I would do it again..hands down. My attitude now is all about being healthy..period.  This does include staying smoke free..eating healthy..exercising every day...meditating every day...basically a holistic approach to my well being.
    Quit the killer addiction first ....sorry about the pounds later ...     
    Don't worry about the weight gain, you can normalise this later.        Cigarettes tend to speed up the metabolism (well, it is poison!) so it's common for that to slow down for a bit when you quit. This will normalise pretty quickly as long as you don't start eating more or replacing the cigs with snacks etc. I didn't replace it with anything so I gained no weight. I remember my metabolism taking a little knock back in the beginning but I just rode it out and all was back to normal in no time.         TBH, a little weight gain is MINOR compared to smoking god knows how many cigarettes a day.
Ugh okay so after 6/7 weeks smoke free I was surrounded by a fellow quitter who re-started smoking a few days back, I took several drags from her cigarette! However I dont have the crave to do more! I am however suffering with that consequence by coughing
Hi Axyz! Well we all know how those relapses are... and good for you that you are not going back to smoking! - but- make a plan, you don't want to fall into that same pit over and over again.. (which will guarantee a relapse)   Stay closer to the forum and commit!  Edited October 8 by Vivianne
    Sorry to hear you chose to smoke, Axyz. Even if you have a quit buddy, you need to make your quit all about YOU and not pay any mind to other people's failures or, be tempted by other smokers.    You are not missing anything...they are missing everything.     I am glad you decided to start again.   You can build yourself a successful quit    by learning more about nicotine addiction and internalizing the information.    NOPE means NOPE and Freedom is delicious.    
    Sorry you smoked and lost your previous quit ....   But good to hear you are back on track .... Learn by this ...so next time your more prepared ....   There will always be smokers ....you have to guard your quit ....it's your life .....   Re- read everything again ... specially Romancing the cig ....   
    Glad you're back on your quit Axyz, next time maybe try posting an SOS before you smoke so we can help you past it.
    Hop back on the no smoking Train.  Get back to it.  Glad those puffs didn’t reignite strong craves.  That was a big risk.  Play it safe & healthy.  Not one puff ever...
    Restart the whole process from the beginning once again .       Staying away from cigarettes will give you more satisfaction than smoking it in the long run .      I did a very detailed blood test yesterday because the doctor said so .     Thank lord , everything is normal .     I was very tensed until i got that result .     You do not want to go through that
    Sorry to hear you relapsed, but happy to hear you're not going to keep smoking and set a quit date for a week or so.        You messed up. We all have, it's not the end of the world.      Do it again and we're going to have to have a serious talk though. 
    start again tomorrow

    Get right back aboard the Train! It's so important not to let a momentary lapse become full-blown addiction again. You had a few puffs. It was an unfortunate choice, but you learned from it. Now recommit to never taking a single puff again! You can do it.
Sometimes people relapse. You've done well to get right back on again but you know you will need to be extra careful now to keep your quit.  The brain is funny and will want to give in more easily having relapsed once.          I tried to build a system to not smoke by going into temptation on my own terms i.e. I would choose to go and stand with smoke buddies but it was a moment when I was prepared and knew ahead of time what I was going to do.  This helped me prepare for the unexpected triggers because I had built up an internal mechanism and routine to resist.       Not that it wasn't hard ... it just was something I could leverage.Edited October 8 by d2e8b8

    How are you now @Axyz?
What are some examples of thinking that should send up a red flag that somebody is romanticizing smoking?  As we know, relapse is always planned and usually starts with romancing the cigarette well before conscience choice to take a puff is made. Since I will always be a nicotine addict I must expect, detect and then reject any thoughts of romancing smoking because if I start to entertain those thoughts, the seed of relapse will be planted. Any thoughts that smoking somehow benefits you in any way is a red flag. If you think that it's too hard to stay quit is another good one.  It's harder to smoke and maintain the constant state of withdrawal than it is to break the addiction once and forever.
If I could just have a cigarette, I could calm down and figure this out...
.
My 'romancing' has evolved. It used to be about all of the things above.  Then it became an irrational want, even an ache. It was almost as though the junkie knew it could not win a rational argument, so tried something else. Still occasionally the image of sitting on a sunny terrace somewhere, overlooking the beach with a drink and a cigarette comes to mind as 'on holiday' and this appeals. All I then do is roll forward the day in my mind; stepping out of the romantic meal to get my fix. Using mouthwash to freshen my breath, being out of puff as I climb the stairs back to the room....these realities soon chase the picture away.
I always thought smoking would get me through all life's troubles...Allen Carr helped me look at this in a totally different light....I never considered my self a drug addict....I think all my romancing disappeared once this had sunk in....Also,watching someone spend 16 hours of everyday....hooked up to a oxygen machine...Takes all the romance away...when ever I think of a smoke now....I look in his direction.....it goes very quickly....Xxxxxx
After finishing a chore, sit down and relax with a smoke...
When I'm crisis, I think I need a cigarette to get me through but it only worsens the destructive thinking and IN FACT: I think later on NO I don't really enjoy smoking so why smoke?
I know in the past, whenever I started fixating on that one cigarette, I was in danger of relapse. Obsessing over that one cigarette that I can really remember making me "feel good" ...more than likely it was a moment where I had to go a long period of time without smoking...which is why it made me feel good...or during a night of drinking...that was always another. Again..another illusion. I feel good NOW..as a non smoker. As a matter of fact...I feel great. I don't drink...or if i do...it's rare these days. Nothing to romance. :) It was all an illusion....one big fat liar. Just me, myself, and I...and I love it that way. There is no substance on this earth that makes me feel good except good fuel and exercise...proper sleep...and a healthy, positive attitude. That's it in a nutshell. The unhealthy romance between me and big bad tobacco is OVER. My blinders are off and tossed in the trash.
ANY thought you may have that doesn't immediately  represent smoking as an Addictive Deadly Poison  ( that will enslave you within puffs)                                    is                A Big Fat Lie. Save your Romance for LOVE. (edited to add) Once I educated myself, the romance for nicotine was dead Dead D E A D.
As we all know I romanced the cigarette at around my 7 month quit, and to me, it was a small thought in the back of my head that I allowed to grow, and the more it grew the more it was all I could think about 24/7, thinking just one, just to see, I was testing myself, telling myself that I missed the cigarette, that I missed smoking, I deliberately put myself with someone who smoked who I knew would offer me one, without me actually asking for one, so then I could lay the blame at someone else's door.  The addiction took me back.  As soon as that thought appears show it the door,  NO is all it takes, xxx
Jackie...This was a brilliant honest post....it was a great reminder....thank you sweetheart....
My experience is much the same as Jackie's. I quit more than 7 months ago. I frequently want a cigarette-- I think about it every day. But then I quickly chase that thought from my head and go on about my life. The "thought" never rises to the level of a "crave" and does not pose a danger. For me, the danger comes in when I start obsessing about a cigarette. I start thinking about it and wanting it and I can't seem to shake the thought. It keeps plaguing me hour after hour, day after day until it wears me down. I don't WANT to smoke, but I can't stand this corrosive, constant fantasizing about cigarettes. That is why I relapsed (in the past, that is)-- I was trying to quiet that voice.   Now when I start to obsess about smoking, I have learned to ask myself what is bothering me in my life and why? Why am I feeling tense or anxious or bored or tired? When I have identified what I am feeling and why, then I take steps to dissipate those feelings. Perhaps exercise (which is good for whatever ails you) or more sleep or meditation or call a friend or something. Basically, my brain is used to using cigarettes to deal with any distressing emotion so that I don't actually have to deal with things. Now I know that I have to take conscious, active steps to resolve my problems and then my cigarette obsession magically stops.
After a while, you think you are super solid in your quit and then think, "well I can smoke socially.  It doesn't mean I'll start smoking all the time again."  WRONG!  As a nicotine addict, just that one puff, just one will send you back into a world of jonesing for a smoke every 30-45 minutes or so.  You cannot smoke EVER.  If a crave hits, accept it for what it is, tell it to go away, and move on.  Done.  Think about how much better you feel without a cigarette.  Instead of romancing the cigarette, see it as Death came a callin.
There is no such thing as ...I'll just have one.......If I could just have one.....I wouldn't be here.......I am a addict.....Not one puff ever.....it's the only way.........why risk it......
I knew I had COMPLETELY banished any thoughts of smoking again when I pulled my winter coat out, put it on (it reeked of stale smoke even though it had been to the dry cleaners) and I found a lighter in my pocket. The only feeling I had was a twinge of sadness for that girl who was addicted. The girl who stood outside in snowstorms to get her fix. The girl who almost had a seizure if she couldn't find a lighter. The coat got donated to charity. The lighter got thrown in the junk drawer for the bbq. And I ordered a new Canada Goose coat! :) 
Great story, Julie. I think you were smart to donate that coat to charity. And hey, some of that $3,252 you saved on cigarettes should absolutely go for a new Canada Goose coat. Clean, warm and patriotic all at once!  :)
I am now; for the times I smoked with my ex-gf... she's coming over!I realise I'm strong in my quit
I never doubted it for a second....Your a strong cookie ....Hugs xx

Oh my Goodness there is the me of the past almost 4 years ago, I could cry I could have been 4 years nearly quit by now if I hadn't let the addiction take over again. Really needed to see this. Here I am at the start again, I shall keep referring back to this when that addiction starts calling again, just to remind myself that I don't want to be writing a similar post like this in 4 years time! No more groundhog day! xx
    Thinking that nothing tastes better than coffee with a cigarette. That cigarettes are always there for me. That they make me look like a badass diva. Smoker-me used to be so stupid. 
In truth, there is NOTHING  smoking can offer you other than a statistically probable ugly and painful death for you and the terror for your family witnessing your demise.Check this out alsoRed FlagsEdited October 17, 2018 by Sazerac

I need to read this topic as many times as needed. I am guilty of romancing the cigarette.. and on day 3 hanging on for dear life. My addiction is acting like a rebelious teen and giving me a hundered ways on how to sneak in a cig... or where to buy it, how to hide it from everyone here (I can't and won't , I am a lousy liar..  1 lie will keep me up for nights... ). My addiction is lying to me - telling me it won't happen to me, I won't  get sick... I am invincible, I am not a heavy smoker... so...     So many thoughts running through my mind... can't keep up with them
    We all ran on the lies of nicotine addiction, V.    My biggest one was, 'I really love smoking' which teamed up so well with my complete denial over health issues.     As the truth about addiction emerges, we gain the power to defeat it.   Nurture yourself and your strengths.    You don't smoke anymore !  That is the truth to run with now.       The inner power, self confidence and trust in yourself grows exponentially with every crave you conquer, every trigger you dismiss. You are winning.        Do not let smoky thoughts sit in your brain and fester. Banish them, replace them with thoughts of beauty immediately.   
You are so right @Sazerac       I romanced the cigarette for nearly 40 years.  The power of addiction is really frightening. The biggest obstacle with quitting in the early days is getting far enough away from the addiction to see it for what it really is.        I do struggle from time to time but I know for a fact that is just the addiction trying to get it's hooks into me again.        I learnt three really important lessons here.       1 - take smoking of the table. Do anything else but don't make smoking an option        2 - giving smoking any positive thoughts is nothing more than junkie thinking       3 - keeping the quit you have can sometimes feel like hard work but it's easier to keep the quit you have than start another one
Hello!      I just created a profile for this site. I am a 31 year-old man, and have been a chain smoker since age 23 or 24. I recently attempted to quit nicotine cold turkey. I made it 3 and a half days, then bought a pack and started up again. I have tried nicotine gum in the past, and have found it unsuccessful for me. I am very interested in quitting cold turkey.       My intention is to attempt a quit again within the next week or so. I think where I stumbled with my most recent attempt was in not having a clear timeline, as far as moving past the most intense physical withdrawal symptoms. I've heard varying accounts of the timeline - some say it gets easier after day 3, day 5, one week, etc. I know that the physical withdrawal symptoms eventually go away - but I need to be fully prepared for however my own body adjusts. Patience will be key.     I desperately want this year to be the year I quit smoking for good. If anyone out there has input about their own smoking histories, and how it affected the length of time of withdrawal, I would very much like to hear about it. Thank you.
Its not the length of time you smoke for that counts. You need to realise its a nicotine addiction you suffer from. You will always be an addict and your brain will always to a greater or lesser degree try to persuade you to smoke.     The only way to stop is to realise this and decide you will never take another puff.        The worst symptoms last 3 days once you achieve this they will reduce gradually over the weeks months years.        Once you decide never to smoke again you will be mostly there.
Welcome to our jolly band of quitters, Christian.       The most important component to a successful quit is Education about nicotine addiction.    You must read, read, read and absorb the information.       This makes your quit easier too, because you understand what you are going through.  Everything makes sense.    So, take the time and educate yourself.     Quitting is a matter of initially, short term physical withdrawals. The real work comes in changing our patterns, re-programming our reward system, and learning to live FREE.  All this is a highly individual matter but, in general it takes about a year to weed through all the craves and seasonal triggers.      This isn't a year of full on craziness...just a year of consistently paying close attention to a commitment to NOPE (Not One Puff Ever).    Once you understand addiction, this makes perfect sense.  We must always stay committed to NOPE.        I am a cold turkey quitter.  I didn't want to prolong my suffering and didn't want to spend any more ducats on nicotine.    Stock up on fruit juices and small rewards.     You may find this post (and the many links embedded) helpful to you.10 Ways To Effectively Use This Forum To Help Yourself Quit Smoking I smoked for 40 something years.  Addiction is addiction, nobody is more addicted than anyone else...or less addicted either.       There is no reason to continue to smoke, Christian. Once you make the decision...GO FOR IT !    You will never regret quitting and your whole life will change for the better.  S
    and a great page of resources from our friend, Joel Spitzer  What Withdrawals Should I Expect From Quitting Smoking
Sadly there ya no hard and fast rule...as the others have said accepting you are a nicotine addict and learning how this addiction works are the keys. I very much just took it as 1 day at a time. I only ever worried about not smoking for the single day.       So the way my addiction works is that the habit and the emotional addiction was stronger than the physical addiction. I needed to break those to feel comfortable in my quit. So this time I used NRT gum and it helped get me passed the hurdle...do I wish I had quit cold turkey, sure, but it wasn't my reality.        What I can tell you is cold turkey, hypnosis, Champix, NRT there are no short cuts...you have to go through the hairy days to get up those hay days.        Biggest tips....    1. Only quit for one day at a time, don't worry about tomorrow, just focus on today. 24 little hours.   2. Keep you fluids and blood sugars up...drink juice, it Kilda two birds with one stone.    3. Learn, learn, learn....how the addiction works, what it has done to your brain.  4. Have some placebos, hard lollies (sweets/candies) to suck on, normal gum to chew, mints to suck, a pen to "fake" smoke.      Anyone can quit, including you, it doesn't take a miracle, or a super power Nd definately not luck....all it takes is promising yourself never to put anything in your mouth and set it on fire and smoke it and fighting to keep that promise. That's it.Edited October 7 by notsmokinjo
Treat your brain as a separate entity . It always needs smoke , it will be always asking for a smoke  to fulfill its strange needs  . In my humble opinion  its so used to that firing      And start fighting with your brain .        Every time you crave for a smoke , just remember it is the brain that needs the smoke and not you .     Life is going to be really dull in the first 2 weeks , that will slowly change , you will feel more and more fresh as time passes by .
As you put your nicotine addiction to sleep, your brain re-wires itself,        of course, it can be instantly re-activated which is why NOPE (Not One Puff Ever) is so important to internalize        but, once you start retraining your brain, your thoughts and reward system  become your own again and not the addictions.       Your brain will not always be actively asking/demanding nicotine,   you can awaken it and must stay somewhat vigilant   but, it leaves your conscious mind after a while.   You won't be thinking about smoking or nicotine every 20 minutes like you did when you smoked and also when you first quit.
    You have received a lot of great information Christian! Make your mind up to quit no matter what comes your way. As others have said, there's the physical withdrawal  which doesn't last all that long (a few days of really strong carvings at times) but then there's adjusting your lifestyle to no longer include smoking. That's what takes a lot of patience and time. There will be triggers that make you think; "Hey! I should be having a smoke." because that's what you have done for years and years but now, smoking is completely off the table for you so learn new rewards to give yourself - not a smoke anymore. Quitting is a marathon, not a sprint. Stay firm to your commitment and be patient. It will happen if you follow the process - just NOPE! (Not One Puff Ever)
    Welcome Christian and congratulations on deciding to quit. For me the first three days were actually the easiest. I still had nicotine in my system but come that fourth day and I started to struggle. But since I was determined to succeed I stuck close to home and only ventured out when my never smoker husband could go with me because I didn't trust myself to not stop and buy a pack.   It wasn't until I found a forum with others who also gave up this nasty addiction that I started feeling better and more confident in my being able to do this. Being a part of a group who knows what you're going through and supports you are key. At least for me and hopefully you'll find the same true for you.  Everyone's quit is different but the same. We all have to go through the misery, some worse than others. Having the right mindset and your young age on your side will help a bunch 
    Welcome Christian you are making a great choice in quitting.  Those above have already given great advice.  The physical withdrawals only last a few days and are a pain to get thru but can be done with focus and commitment (and some cold water and deep breathing techniques).  The work comes after that in re-educating yourself on living a smoke free life and getting thru the craves. Coming here and going thru the site can help with that be it education, asking for advice, or just socializing -- it really can help.  Keep strong, this can be done!!!!

You need to change your mindset. Either you smoke or you don't smoke. If you quit, you've made a decision to not smoke anymore.      If you were getting married, you wouldn't say "I'll attempt to stay faithful" to your wife, would you? I would hope not.        If you're committed to never smoke again, you won't smoke again. It really is that simple.
    Welcome aboard..    Everyone is different ....your quit will be different ..... My advice ....why wait ...why put more nicotine in your body ,just to get rid of it ,a little later...  Our brains can be our worst enemies.... Quitting is easier than thinking and fretting over it ...   Think positive not negative.... I went cold turkey...having the threat of losing both my feet due to smoking ,was all it took for me ...    Take smoking off the table ...no matter what ...    Of course your body will be a bit topsy turvy ...you've been feeding it poisons for decades ... Just take your seat...and probably save your life ..
    Being here and interacting is a good start. I was welcomed here when I was still smoking and it made me desperate to be a quitter like everyone else. Stick around and post lots.       I did jillars thing of not smoking in my regular places. It meant I was breaking a lot of associations before my quit even started which helped ease the bigger triggers.       I also found my own thinking affected my quit. If I went around like a miserable I miss smoking mess my quit was hard. If I oozed happiness at being quit it was just so much easier.       Planning is the easiest part. It's simple to say I'm going to quit while you're still smoking. As your quit gets nearer you start thinking up reasons why you should put off the date. The deadline you'll never meet if you're not smoking, the party you've agreed to go to etc etc etc. Quit and stick with it.      You'll find lots of support here so use it.     Good Luck 
Members2,422 posts      quitdate:           9-24-12LocationOwn WorldPosted 24 September 2012 - 03:27 PMQuit now. Actually about an hour ago I had last. Woke up this morning and said today is the day. Thought about it for a week, here and there "ought to quit again." Been sucessful for a year a few times, two years one time. Pulled out Chantax I tried a few years ago this morning. Didnt like the dreams last time and quit taking it. It worked for a few weeks then had the puff. Pills expired last year, what the hell I will take one anyways. Found the board about an hour ago and started reading. Haven't decided if I am calling doctor for another prescription or going cold turkey. Been reading the craving stuff, and after an hour I am getting hungry, so off for a Subway for a treat of making it an hour.
And the rest is.... History 
page 1- try to copy/paste. thanks Elton, thought first post should stand alone.   Posted 25 September 2012 - 09:33 AMDay 2. Made it so far. This morning was toughest part. Did it minute at time. Where is all the encouragement? Didnt say anything to anyone yet. See if anyone notices.   #3  jen Posted 25 September 2012 - 09:39 AMHi congrats on your quit I wouldnt take pills if they were out of date myself but hey, anyway just be strong and you will get through the first three days it does get better, make sure you drink plenty of water help flush the nicotine out of your system    #4  iajdani Posted 25 September 2012 - 09:42 AMGreat going.Expect these for day 2,3,4Headache, craving, drowsiness. But it all will ease up on 5th day. Keep it up. #5  PilgrimUKPosted 25 September 2012 - 09:53 AMWelcome bakon. I would always advice the cold turkey route.72 hours, everything is out the system.Anything after that point is psychological triggers.You can reduce a lot of symptoms such as lack of concentration/focus and headaches by drinking fruit juices and cutting Tea/Coffee consumption in half.Click any of my signature links for some great reading about giving up. #6  soul Posted 25 September 2012 - 10:10 AMbakon, welcome to the forum!!!By now you have noticed that a craving will not kill you................smoking will though............I suggest you continue to read up in the newbie package in here and whatever info you get about quitting tips and more importantly about STAYING quit.................you have been that road before and have learned from your mistakes.......the key is to change your strategy, be prepared, have a plan B for all your routines, brace yourself and jump, we will catch you!Quit for yourself but not by yourself!  #7  bakon Posted 25 September 2012 - 10:28 AMThanks for help. Not a coffee drinker. Tea at times but like it cold and lemonade is just as good. Cold turkey seems to work best for me. Patches prolong quit. Get my mind wrapped on no more, and that is the way it is. Like the little counter, lets me know I earned something. Watching your counters is helpful too. No problems so far, son in hospital with broken hand. Getting surgery now, so just sitting around watching people walk by carrying their oxygen. Easy.thanks again #8   babs609  Posted 25 September 2012 - 10:30 AMGo Bakon!!!! You can do this..one craving at a time. Stick close to the board and read, read, read!!!

He will probably recover very well, kids tend to.............i work in physical therapy and have witnessed such incredible recoveries with kids............Remember to use breathing if you feel cravings creep in...............nice slow breathing in and out............Stay close, read and post...........Cold turkey seems to work extremely well for countless people  From your words i can sense that you are determined and happy to take this step into a new life style! #10  4mylife Posted 25 September 2012 - 11:32 AMHello Bakon!!!It looks like you have been giving some great advice from the others here..I want to welcome you and say that it looks like you are really doing amazing!!!!!!Water, deep breaths and walking my dogs have got me through some really tough times.Reading here got me to my quit, and pretty much keeps me sane Again welcome and I hope all goes well with your son, keep us updated.. #11  TimidTulipPosted 25 September 2012 - 12:20 PMWelcome aboard the board!Just stick with it, just remember we have all quit and we wouldn't have been able to if it stayed feeling as bad as those first few days - things WILL improve!    #12  thebean Bakon, that little counter helps me too! I am rooting for you! Keep going, you can do it!  #13  bakon Posted 25 September 2012 - 04:09 PMNo big cravings yet. Keeping blood sugar up. Son is 25, Afghanistan veterarn Marine with purple heart.

Also smell some good food cooking.   #14  thebeanPosted 25 September 2012 - 06:43 PMwow, lucky! I still don't have a full sense of smell yet.. enjoy that!!!! Keep going.. every hour adds up.. you'll be amazed.  #15  bakon Posted 25 September 2012 - 08:39 PMsoul,just saw Mars PA. In Pittsburgh. Drove to Mars twice a month for last 20 years. Really Zelianople but close enough.Bed time. Made it all day. Wife noticed and had my largest craving talking about what I read and learned here.No more talking about it. #16  mark1976Posted 25 September 2012 - 08:52 PMWelcome Bakon!!! Seems like u are having an easy time so far but you know how easy it is to go back. From this point on your view on smoking should be the same as all of us here. NOPE.  #17  bakon Posted 26 September 2012 - 01:10 PMDay 3 is hitting like a train. Hardest and most intense cravings so far. NOPE is working and I am holding strong. Easy to slip here for one puff on old attempts. Feel better after reading in here. Like walking out of the theater after seeing a Rocky movie. I can do it attitude.   #18  marciemPosted 26 September 2012 - 01:16 PMbakon saidDay 3 is hitting like a train. Hardest and most intense cravings so far. NOPE is working and I am holding strong.

This road is an uneven one, meaning that there are smooth times and rocky times. Hold on to the smooth times in your heart!! The bumpy ones too...they will remind you why you never ever want to be on this road again in your lifetime. The only way to avoid this road in the future is to stay on it NOW!! Straight ahead, don't look back, sure as hell don't GO back!!  #19  JTPhillyPosted 26 September 2012 - 01:27 PMsounds like you are doing great bacon - make sure you have a snack and stay hydrated - punch something if you need too - all that you are feeling is your body throwing off it's dependance - it can be rough bit it does get better - remember you don't want to do this again? right? #20  bakonPosted 26 September 2012 - 01:31 PMHanging in there.

Wow...congrats....2years....Thanks for sticking around  and makin me laugh........nice work...    Doorbell xx
Thanks Doorbell.  #21  soul Posted 26 September 2012 - 06:24 PMstay close.........keep reading and posting! #22  bakon Made it to 4. Ok today. One big thought of giving up but went away after some pushing. Morning going smooth. Little reading helps put the mind in right place to do this. #23  iajdaniPosted 27 September 2012 - 10:18 AMHang in there. This is the toughest day. Things will start easing up from tomorrow. #24  PilgrimUK Posted 27 September 2012 - 10:23 AMWell done.Day 4 is the golden day in quitting.All the nicotine is now out your system. The body can now get on with its job of Recovery & repair.All triggers from now on are psychological or associational craves (after meals, out with mates...etc) #25  bakonPosted 27 September 2012 - 10:25 AMOK. Take your word for it. Think I have failed 1000 times on day four. But didnt have a place to post or read about it then. Feel testy, dont want to let the anger bug pop off but he is right there under the surface. #26  PilgrimUKPosted 27 September 2012 - 10:42 AMBut could that simply be "reference stress"You have said you failed before at 4 days and that is in your mind, you don't want it happening yet again?It sounds like it.Sound like a little tension of wanting it to succeed.If you dwell on it, you might give yourself problems.Just get on and do something: read; clean; go for a walk...etc. #27  bakon Posted 27 September 2012 - 01:28 PMTook a walk in rain with dogs. Planning evening meal and just killing time. Day off, so pretty bored and trying to break old habits associated with smoking. No big problems, minor irritations is all. Sticking with NOPE and pushing through. I will make it, smell is coming back pretty good. Thanks everyone #28   babs609  Posted 27 September 2012 - 01:44 PMbakon...you are right where you need to be. Yes....annoying at times...but, doable. Pretty much how life is sometimes, right? Fabulous, annoying, and doable...all wrapped into one Congrats!!  #29  BAH Posted 27 September 2012 - 02:43 PMYes you will...keep it up....be VERY very proud of yourselfI will make it #30  bakon Posted 28 September 2012 - 09:44 AMDay 5. Moving along. Its in the back of my head but easier than first 8 hours. Must be lightening up. Going back to work today. Smoked alot there but not worried. Will keep myself busy so it wont be missed. Keeping NOPE in my thoughts. Also like the signature which says One Puff from a Pack a Day. So true.  #31  bakon Posted 29 September 2012 - 05:49 PMDay 6. Going good. Smell is amazing. Bored at times I used to smoke. Keeping busy.  #32  soul Posted 29 September 2012 - 05:52 PMgreat news There is nothing wrong with being bored.........at times, we find ourself ! We are not such bad company after all............ #33  kickitorfcckit good job, bakon #34  bakonPosted 30 September 2012 - 04:09 PMDay 7 No smoke- irritated most of day.Didnt start work till 3pm, got up 8am, raining, cold out, just one of those sit around do nothing days until I had to leave. Just edgy. Not ready to flip out but not calm and relaxed. I know the "3 days its out of your system", but the brain is more powerful and needs shoved in right direction.Dont plan on smoking, but dont want to be in a bad mood for no reason. #35  Guest__* Posted 30 September 2012 - 04:57 PMThree days and the nicotine is physically out of your system, but the mental aspect is even more challenging. Just keep making smoking not an option and you will do just fine  . And remember, we all had bad days, even for no reason, when we were smokers too. Hang in there, it's worth it! #36  soul Posted 30 September 2012 - 05:35 PMall a mind game now................have a plan, a strategy and keep surprising your "adversary"..........  #37  bakon Posted 30 September 2012 - 07:01 PMMind game is right. Actually smelled someone smoking and it stinks to me. Got to break some of those subconsciuos triggers. Went back and did some reading, thanks everyone. Again not an SOS, just working through it. #38  freshyoselfPosted 01 October 2012 - 02:38 AMBakon! #39  bakon Posted 01 October 2012 - 05:29 PMDay 8. Going smooth. Learning to relax and enjoy whatever is going on. Thinking the smokes were causing me to rush things to get to next one. Spending time in garage before work, where I did all my smokiing at home. Didnt have an urge. Washed bike and still no urge. Site is great for telling what to expect and how to retrain my sub conscious to enjoy not smoking.I dont even like typing the word right now. Like its a swear or something shameful.Anyways just checking in. All good today and easing up. #40  bakon Posted 02 October 2012 - 11:44 AMDay 9-Still here smoke free. Reading others fight on this. The group is great for support. Nice work everyone.
Starting nowStarted by bakon, Sep 24 2012 11:27 AM #41  soulPosted 02 October 2012 - 11:54 AMnice work to you too Bakon!Keep on moving forward and you will discover deeper levels of Freedom you did not even suspect existed...... #42  bakon Posted 03 October 2012 - 08:13 PMDay 10- Another day done. Sleeping longer than in past. Was a 7 hour a night person. This week I am 8 to 9 hours a night. More dreams too.No complaints.#43  bakon Posted 05 October 2012 - 01:21 PMDay 12 - I did first night out with guys at our regular smokey bar. Made it three hours and no smoking. Thought this would be a hard test...thought about having one...thoughts pass and smell was overwelming. Watched the other smokers, 20 minutes fire another one. 20 minutes another.. looked like an addiction now. Felt bad for them, didnt want to be preachy and say anything though. Got to learn on thier own. Had headache from the place.Well I believe that was my first real hard, true test. Kept NOPE in mind. Didnt want to reset my counter or wake up thinking I was ok with only one after all that time. I earned my quit.SO got past a milestone for me. Now looking for the 2 week mark. #44  JTPhilly Posted 05 October 2012 - 01:28 PMfeels good right bacon? I thought it would be hard to maintain my quit and my social life but I #45  dls46711 Posted 05 October 2012 - 01:32 PMWhat an awesome job! I remember the first time out in a smoky place after i quit. Staring at everyone smoking. Glad you saw it in the negative way! Congrats. You are doing everything right! #46  bakon Posted 06 October 2012 - 05:50 PMDay 13 Made first night working 11-7. Midnight shift was for smoking. Lots of dead time. Nothing much to do passing the time.Didnt miss it at all. NOPE and moving on. Thanks again everyone. Couple hours and it will be two weeks.#47  avian3Posted 06 October 2012 - 06:12 PMGood for you! Boredom was always a trigger for me. Eventually, like me, you can be really bored and the thought of smoking will never enter your mind. #48   babs609 Posted 06 October 2012 - 10:32 PMdoing great Bakon..keep it up  #49  bakon Posted 08 October 2012 - 01:13 AMMade it two weeks. Feel good. I would not call it a crave, but a thought will pop up now and then. I dont act on it and certainly going to keep with NOPE. It has got easier, but hoping it gets even easier. Breaking the old habits of smoking with an activity is tough too. Just have to do them and realize a glass of water or whatever is all that is there now. Thanks for all the help everyone.#50  youngster513Posted 08 October 2012 - 01:16 AMCongrats Bakon! It looks like me and you started about the same time but just hours apart.

I love the daily updates and I think it is so helpful to other newbies to follow your journey and see how you deal with cravings and temptations. Keep that quit looking great! #54  bakon Posted 09 October 2012 - 01:41 AMSomeone called me their Role Model. WOW. Guy didnt smoke for 12 years and he is watching me.And another is only a few hours ahead of me on their quit. Kind of like quiting with a buddy. Glad I didnt have youngsters cost of smokes though. I was paying about $55 for a carton and his money saved is higher than mine.Years ago I would buy a pack a day. Thinking if I quit overnight, I wouldnt waste any money or smokes. That was my thinking, I would just wake up and quit. Everyday back to store.Well I did quit..... but finding this board and reading others struggles and successes push me forward.Today was easy. Worked nights but was busy. Got up and cold outside. Cut grass, didnt even think about smoke. Used to light one up on way to shed, light another half way through with a drink of water, another when I was done admiring the look of the yard. Today I smelled the yard. Not the faint smell of cut grass even smokers sometimes get. I could smell the mud in the back corner where I dump the grass, the grass, the gasoline, dog do, some fallen leaves. Everything had its own smell.Far as craves...none. Desires or thoughts..maybe one. Easing up. Got NOPE in front now. Just tough habit. Everyone has finally noticed. So a shameful future if I forget NOPE.I am the original smoker and addict to the core for it. So if I can do 16 days, cold turkey, and it is getting easy, anyone can do it. Years ago people would say I wasnt allowed to quit, too crabby to begin with, would rip your head off and worse when I would try going without the fix for a few days. Maybe I am getting old, or maybe just happy to put them down this time.From the generation where everyone smoked when I grew up. They smoked on tv, in every building, at every event. Remember the Marboro Man on the largest billboard in town. The one which sat over the Liberty bridge by itself. To be grown up you smoked. All teenagers smoked, couldnt wait to be cool like them...I smoked through the ARMY, three decades since becoming cool. Not all pack a day times. The last 15 years probably. Had Ultra Lights which cant hurt because they are "100 percent natural too"..Go to the races. It's the Winston Cup whose slogan was "One Big Smoking Section"and handed out cartons in the infield. We were all drinking and having a good time with the "free smokes". Nobody was telling us where we could smoke and the sponser says so..And I will buy another pack each day for years in support of the freedom.Well times are reverse. Uncool to smoke. "When are you going to quit.." Being last guy to give it up. Not really, but feel like it. Remember when non smoking sections came out. Who wants to sit there? Now there is no smoking in bars. Did this too long. Standing outside at buildings, bars, hotels, crowded near doors with the other junkies.No more. NOPEThose free cartons of smokes probably cost $36500.00 using 20 years at $5 a pack. #55  lynn1957Bakon,Congrats on 16 days quit. I too remember when it was acceptable to smoke. My mother kept ashtrays on the livingroom tables for company (nobody smoked in my family). All bars, restaurants and hotels were smoking. I smoked at work, in airplanes and anywhere I darn well wanted to. I feel like you- should have quit a long time ago when it started to become socially unacceptable. But, at least we've getting there now. NOPE #56  bakon Posted 09 October 2012 - 07:35 PM16- I look at the counter- 309 cigarettes. Have to pause to picture them laid out. Dont feel like I have missed that many. First couple days, sure I missed the 25 listed. But over 300, I have trouble picturing, I really missed 309. No way. Feels like a few days worth, so 60-. But does not feel like more, happy with that. Must be easing up more than I have noticed.No problems today. Waking up, still not jumping out of bed like I used to. Probably cause I ran to garage to light up before. Dont need the fix to get moving, or is it get moving for the fix?Anyways only upon getting up do I even think about it. Not a crave, just a thought, lasts about a MINUTE. Still marching with NOPE. I am the puff away from a pack guy. #57  ATCSharpPosted 09 October 2012 - 07:42 PMKeep it up! I just hit one week today. IT GETS EASIER! I PROMISE! Today was almost a normal day. The cravings are very weak!#58  bakon17- Easy peezy. Been walking dogs. Slightly longer here and there. Feels good to get blood pumping. One thought, minor, 30 seconds. Smelled someone smoking outside business. Felt bad for them sitting there with cold weather coming. Getting the fix.NOPE- what a nice little word with so much strength. #59  candothis Posted 10 October 2012 - 06:25 PMBakon you are such an inspiration! I love reading your journal! Way to go!! And thank you for sharing! #60  bakon Posted 11 October 2012 - 06:10 AMThe inspiration for me is everyone who responded to this thread. Anyone with a comment helped push me to here. Another day and another pack I didnt smoke because of the kind words and support. Thanks everyone.Had a long talk with an ex smoker. Cold turkey guy. Hospital trip for two weeks for him, but smoke free two years. Also a current smoker who "enjoys it still". All I could do is tell them about the site and what I learned. How do you explain nicotine without preaching? It all comes out sounding like they are complete dumbass for saying "they enjoy it" of course you enjoy the nicotine but both admit they hated smell and health issues. Thier replying sounded ridiculous. No its relaxing. No its just the physical part. No its the satisfaction. No its ..... the nicotine dumbass.NOPE
#61  soul bakon,good to read that you are doing well and discovering many things about the addiction and about yourself.Quote.............No its ..... the nicotine ............I think that it is much more than the nicotine. Smoking provides to the smoker with an escape from the present, it also provides the smoker a place where to hide from his/her emotions. Cigarettes also can be felt as a "companion", some say it takes boredom away. In the morning, it helps you wake up, when nervous it helps you calm down, not to mention how it affects your appetite.................and there are so many more reasons that people use (often without knowing) to continue the self-destructive path that smoking offers.This addiction is cunning, baffling and powerful. The hundred of chemicals in cigarettes affect the body as well, not only nicotine alters and desstroys the normal state of the body............Keep on being the example bakon, keep on moving forward, the quit is obviously opening many doors for you. Be proud of your accomplishment. #62  bakonPosted 12 October 2012 - 12:17 AM18- OK much of day. Got crabby around 9pm, about an hour before I get ready for work. No reason, but is my 7 day in a row for work. We work 28 day rotation and change shift weekly. Like to blame that but usually last one before days off I am in good mood. Slight headache, tired and hungry so its just no fun right now. Steelers just lost too.Not worried about smoking right now, just not easy pezzy like yesterday.Nope.#63  youngster513 Posted 12 October 2012 - 12:37 AMNOPE, NOPE, NOPE! TGIF soon! #64  bakon Posted 13 October 2012 - 10:33 AMDay 20- Just starting day. Yesterday was ok. Had lots of stress, furniture we waited 6 weeks for didnt fit where we wanted. Had to send back, reorder/shop for something else. Mother coming to visit, another stresser. But no smokes. Went to dinner with wife and friends, drink after for two hours in seriously smokey bar, made it, but could have caved there if I knew I could get away with it. Also didnt want to reset counter. 20 is big number right now.Moving foward. #65  bakonPosted 14 October 2012 - 11:15 AMThree weeks today. WOW. Easier than start but still no piece of pie either. Painting rooms today. Hate painting. No urges, couple thoughts of smoking but too busy to dwell on them. Anyways, keep marching, NOPE #66  Bradley ParkerPosted 14 October 2012 - 12:05 PMbakon saidThree weeks today. WOW. Easier than start but still no piece of pie either. Painting rooms today. Hate painting. No urges, couple thoughts of smoking but too busy to dwell on them. Anyways, keep marching, NOPEHey, just think how much longer the painting would take, if every half hour, all progress stopped for a duration of ten minutes... Sounds more frustrating than just chugging through and enjoying all that time left over at the end, or at least finishing the job in one day instead of 1+1/2... #67  bakon Posted 15 October 2012 - 03:55 PM22- Spent day painting again. Hate painting but it was easier not getting worked up where to stop to take break. Just keep going, around the room, up hall around another room and up stairs. Took 8 hours of nonstop work. Didnt miss the smoking. Did try to light up an imaginary one where I was stirring the paint. Old habit. Wonder how long things like that will pop up.Like I siad yesterday, it is easier. Much, and worth it. But those thoughts of missing something pop up now and then. Miss that buzz but not anything else. Not the smell, taste, ashtray. Not buying, carrying, looking for lighter. Not packing them, running out and worry about when I can have another. Dont miss smoking a few in a row to get ready for time I cant have one. Dont miss running outside after meal, or at bar where there is no smoking. Huddled around some old stinky ashtray on a window sill, or worse some can in the corner. Dont miss my truck smelling like a butt. Dont miss the headache or dry mouth it gives at times.NOPE #68  Bradley ParkerPosted 15 October 2012 - 06:11 PMbakon saidDont miss the headache or dry mouth it gives at times.NOPEAgreed; the dry mouth was a big killer for me. It was causing my teeth to go bad at age 21. Dentist says major improvement; I'm 3 days shy of 2 months. #69  bakon Posted 16 October 2012 - 10:42 AM23- Still wake up looking for smoke but after a minute it goes away. I assume blood sugar is lowest when I wake and causing this. Good otherwise. I am guessing the 1 month /2 month/ 3 and so on get even easier.NOPE is still working. Plus this group. All the comments are helpful. #70  dls46711Posted 16 October 2012 - 01:08 PMIt does keep getting easier. You keep the NOPE attitude, and the voices and urges will fade  Congrats! Keep posting. #71  christine1960 Posted 16 October 2012 - 04:55 PMBakon,Great to see your updates. You are doing great and helping so many newbies with your posts. KTQ!!! #72  bakon24- Still here. Worked then came home and worked on car. Clean it up real good to put away for the winter. Rims off and all that stuff. Two big smoking activities but did not miss it. Looked for my lighter when getting something off work bench. Just a second thought. Kind of funny. Brain programmed to light up upon reaching a certain point in chore. Went and grabbed a root beer for the reward. Had to laugh at it. Thanks for support everyone. Really helps me push on. NOPE for another day...  #73  dancer_I Posted 17 October 2012 - 06:36 PM #74  bakon Posted 18 October 2012 - 03:37 PM25 Still here and not one puff. To me that is the deal. Cant take one or its not a quit. Anyways marching on without any major problems. Is easier but every once in a while it creeps in. Nothing big, no running to store, have not bummed one, mostly dont like smell right now. Wished I had kept an ashtray so when I am in the garage I could lick it. Only real time I want one.Well going to gym. Been going for a while but took summer off with injury. Figure time to go back.Later #75  Bradley ParkerPosted 18 October 2012 - 11:48 PMbakon said25 Still here and not one puff.That's what we like to hear.  t#76  bakon Posted 20 October 2012 - 09:46 AM27- Waiting to hit that 1 month mark. Crazy dreams and sleeping. I wake up a few times a night, which is not unusual but dreams in every segment. Also seem to sleep better, not tired during day (unless I eat something big.) Just dont think I had so many dreams when I smoked. Blamed Chantix for these dreams a few years ago, quit taking it and started smoking again. Cold turkey this time, so maybe just readjusting to new blood and lack of chemicals. #77  christine1960 Congrats on One Month! Keep that great quit going! #78  marciem Posted 20 October 2012 - 08:22 PMHey there bakon, I'm saving you a seat here in the one-month-mobile!! It sure is nice here, lots of goodies and munchies and leather heated seats and all #79  bakonPosted 22 October 2012 - 11:13 AM29- counter says 29 today.waiting for the one month flip. Maybe tomorrow. We work a 28 day rotation, change shifts weekly. So four weeks, 28 days, is a month to me. Still NOPE. Not one. Watched Steelers at smokey bar again last night. Left at half time. Nose all stuffy today. Slight headache but I will blame Sam Adams Octoberfest on that.So I have made several beer nights without lighting up. Watched other smokers, looks kind of silly. Dont miss it. And that smell, its bad and they stink. I wish I never smelled like that to anyone.
more later- this is killing my pointer finger. frekin delete button to remove pictures and signatures
#81  Bradley Parker This is a smoke-free city where I live, and these Indian liquor store guys are often saying "We proudly allow smoking within our store." Who's gonna hate them for it#82  bakon Goofy laws. Some bars have smoking, some dont. Has something to do with nobody under 18 working there and amount of food service. No sure exactly, just some still have it and most dont. Of course private clubs are ok to smoke.30- still here. NOPE is a great saying.. Also still like the "puff away from a pack a day." #83  bakon Posted 24 October 2012 - 08:13 AM31- Got one month on the counter. Working OT today but soon as we finish I am pulling the bike out. Harley- 78 degrees in Pittsburgh today. Hopefully get an hour or two in before dark.Then I am getting a steak and beer for dinner, or margarettas (special on Thursdays) and some Mexican.Thanks for help everyone. Good day. No big problems. Wake up a few times a night, but getting enough sleep.NOPE.#84  BAH Congrats on your first smoke free month#85  bakon Posted 26 October 2012 - 04:07 PM33 hit the one month blah. No excitement and minor irritations. Working through, just adjusting. Rode yesterday 175 miles with a group. First big ride since quiting. One guy smoked. Didnt bother me to not smoke but the habit was right there. Used "NOPE". Need some more time especially with things I associated smoking with. #86  bakonPosted 27 October 2012 - 05:32 PM34. 'Moving along. Easy day. Smelled it on some people but no cravings, want, thoughts. Read about Skip and his posts. Pretty cool he quit and helped others. Some posters on this thread helped me make it to here. Support from group. Thanks all. #87  bakon Posted 28 October 2012 - 04:22 PM35. Counter will read 700 by days end. Cool beans. #88  bakon Posted 29 October 2012 - 06:41 PM36- Into six week. Cold turkey whole time. Hit gym today. I need to go more. Got a few extra pounds now but nothing to bad. Smoking- easy today. No problems, getting used to doing everything without them. Read some people on site and try not to say anything judgemental, just supportive. I hope they read as much as I did and get educated. Luck wont cut it. #89  BAH Posted 29 October 2012 - 09:43 PMOver seven hundred avoided, incredible isnt it?Luck is nice to say, like how are you.fine..but wont get you farYour doing fine baconator, eventually you wont even notice what you used to do with a smoke,promise #90  bakon Posted 29 October 2012 - 09:53 PMActually got bakon name in south florida. Key west during a bike week. Buddy sees some cop pulled on side of dinner earlier in week. Says "look they even got bacon on the side". Saw bike from PA with bacon on plate in Key West..so when the group sees the bacon plate they are all over me to try and get something similiar when we get home.Seems only others with similiar work actually get it. Or anyone old enough to like the movie Smokey and the Bandit.Next time i see him I'll mention to sandwich. #91  BAHPosted 30 October 2012 - 12:51 PMhttps://encrypted-tb...7VnV1WLOY9F1udaLOVE smokey!!! They closed the Burt Reynolds theatre in Jupiter now, did you ever go? As a kid I thought it was some kind of glamorous place Burt hung out at.We let our kids watch this recently and they thought it was awesome. Cracked us up that a movie from then could hold their attention now. They were especially fascinated with the CB radios  #92  bakon Never been there. Funny bacon, pig, smokey...dont hear them anymore.When my son was about 11 we told him about the movie. This was around 2002. He didnt believe me. No way dad. He was all into cars. Finally believes me half way and asks "did the car have a bird on the hood..cuz otherwise its a firebird not a trans am." Standing there like a know it all. Went out and bought the movie on vhs the next day. Probably the only tape i still own. #93  bakon38 days and still marching. No problem today. Mornings when I dont have to work move slower than old days. No jumping up to go get my fix. I can roll over and flip on the boob tube. Flat chested now with HD. Guess not many call it that anymore. Anyways no rush and actually getting used to it. 751 on counter. #94  youngster513 Good job Bakon! #95  pvprincessPosted 01 November 2012 - 03:12 AMBAH saidhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTHhIV5siYPizZc1AQM3B_IbtNS0H-gxH4A_7VnV1WLOY9F1udaLOVE smokey!!!

Thinking less about it. Everyday chores and such are not so strange. Adjusting to life without a smoking turd hanging from my lip. #97  dancer_I Posted 04 November 2012 - 04:20 AMbakon said42- Going smooth. Thinking less about it.

Know I am getting somewhere when I cant remember exact number of days. First couple I was hanging on to each like a gold piece. 1, 2,3...10, 11.Now I got to figure it out. Good sign.Still learning in here. Watching and reading. Bleeding gums- figured I brushed too hard. Didnt even relate it to smoking. Was one tooth for a couple days but didnt see that one.Mostly read here to see how some others are doing. Pay it foward some. I feel fine mostly and even when down or crabby I dont want to smoke. Did it longer than I ever thought I would. Probably didnt want to quit most of the time. But did some of it.Always a little envious of people who hiked or biked or walked, ran, whatever activity I knew would leave me sucking wind. Well a flight of stairs never got me, but 5 floors of stairs would. Run,I aint running anywhere when I got a car or motorcycle... you know the thinking. Now a flight of steps or walk is beneficial and enjoyable.NOPE- great little word. #99  dancer_I Good to see ya bakon. NOPE.  #100  candothisYou're doing so good!Fun to watch your success!
lots more - but holding off, finger is crying and don't want to P O anyone over there that might not want to be over here. maybe I need to pick just my stuff, but they were helpful people on my thread, everyone pushed me on and they were the hero's  i will bring more over if this flies straight, first month was hardest anyways and don't want to give you window lickers too much info to use against me. see what the feeling is anyways, probably only Nancy will like reading the ramblings....she likes everything i do  Two years and don't miss it. So to the newbies, keep posting. Make a year pledge to post at least every day. Just a hello. We need people in all stages of quit. Group is heavy on the old timers right now. We need 1 month, three, five , eight, year and half. All different levels.   As for me. Counter gone. Sgt tossed his much earlier in quit. I kept training wheels longer. As for me posting, ok right now, keeps my mind from other things, winter coming and still enjoy the selfies from all the eggs, belly dancers and bus riders. Hopefully I will know when its time, plenty of good help here. Stay close as long as your feeling it. and a little bit more for good measure.  Little longer, because like Boston says...you'll forget about me once I've been gone.
bakon, if you hit the 'blog this' button, then all of this great info will be forever immortalised in your blog ;)

#101bakonPea BrainPosted 08 November 2012 - 02:00 AM45- Had motorcycle club meetings the last two nights at bars. Couldnt drink, I am working the night shift this week. One bar is smoke free, had some people standing outside at door getting last one in before meeting. Getting cold out so they are huddled in the smoker circle or hunched single style getting the puffs in quick and quiet to return to the main crowd inside with their fresh crapbreath and ashtray perfume. (Sorry but still hate smell) This is the larger HOG chapter meeting with really the only requirement to join is owning a Harley. Ok group, some eating and drinking. Guy uses a microphone to run meeting so its only intimate with who you sit with. Had no thoughts of smoking. Usually puffed away with the other guys outside and couldnt wait to get meeting over to have another and talk bikes.Other club is smaller, meetings in private room. We can smoke and lay it all out without others around. Usually others in bar at same time and they can smoke in same room when not in use. Stunk. Convinced group to stay out in main area for as long as possible.We ate and bullshtted. Covered club business and before I knew it we were done without ever moving to the smoke room.Did miss having a beer with the guys, but that happens alot with the work routine.Glad I wasnt around smoke at both places, dont want it, or need it, dont desire it, dont even think about it, NOPE. #102  BAHPosted 08 November 2012 - 10:54 AMQuoteGlad I wasnt around smoke at both places, dont want it, or need it, dont desire it, dont even think about it, NOPE.AWESOME!  #103youngster513yo Bakon, how you doing?  #104  bakonPosted 14 November 2012 - 09:06 AM51-52 days Thanks for asking.Glad to see your still here too. I haven't posted every day because my quit is kind of boring. No problems and such.Doing fine. I watched Steeler game in smokey club the other night. Wanted one until the place got too smokey. Knew I would blow the whole quit with one puff. Not really tough though, just a thought, not an urge like I needed it, or skin crawling. I could taste it in the air some and the smell was awful so I knew it would lead to a s**t smear down my tongue and regret for the burn in my throat.Then watching smokers was a weird scene.. White stick hanging out of mouth, pack and lighter with their drinks, money and ashtray in front of them. Cell phone too. Like they need a desk to lay out all the supplies they need to watch the game. Sip of beer, toke the smoke, blow it out the side cuz dont want to blow it in anyones face, sit it down and let it burn in ashtray for a few seconds, smoke drifting right at group but they arent holding it so not their fault, sip beer, toke smoke, repeat....Then I was talking to someone who is usually pretty nice, she dont smoke but her husband is club manager and smokes. We quit a few years back around same time. Both made about 2-3 weeks on Chantix and both went back to smoking. Not blaming chantix. Dont think either of us really tried. I couldnt wait to get off it and used it for reason my quit didnt work.Anyways I tell her I quit and she says "Again" . It was like an insult with the tone. Like I was wasting the time and effort. Which is cool with me.My ex said to me one time "again" and I went two years without firing up just to prove to the b!tch she was wrong. Now I dont think she meant to be a bitch but....I will use this to help fortify my resolve.  #105  BAH Anyways I tell her I quit and she says "Again" . It was like an insult with the tone.

You are doing what they think about every day and yet they can not hear and are scared to take that leap.I LOVE boring! Means no BS in my worldNice to hear from you  #106  bakon Posted 16 November 2012 - 10:36 AM53- Going well. Posting some on other threads. Like I know what I am talking about.....Been hitting gym and walking dogs. Sore, every part of me. Been going to gym on and off whole life, go a year, skip a year or two, repeat,...kind of gave up on cardio stuff, mostly weights, dont get out of breath with them when I was smoking...so now I dont smoke and its weights plus treadmill or walk the dogs when I get home. Weather sets course, rain and the dogs stay in.Have not hit gym hard since April when I had a home improvement accident get me a handful of stiches and two weeks off work. Then vacations hit.... so now I got no yardwork, motorcycle tucked away for winter nap (once a month ride all year for me but riding season is over) home improvements done, no more trips planned.....out of excuses so into the gym. And a new gym, with new equipment, and heat. Old gym was awesome to me, large, dark, cold, like the original Rocky movie. One everyone avoids now a day. Best part equipment was so bad and broken the treadmill would just stop after 5 minutes. Stop dead..oh well guess I am done.Well it closed.New gym is bright, wife likes it better, has heat so people are showing off their butts and bicepts. Just trying to find a groove and the right equipment. They got machines for everything. Some free weights, but tight back in that corner, only room for a few. SO I am done for today, even fingers are sore. #107  monojoKeep it up, bakon- you're doing such a wonderful job! Isn't it great to realize how much better life is as a non smoker?   #108    frezlisPosted 17 November 2012 - 02:41 AMWay to go keep on keeping on. I hate working but do it daily I have a treadmill at home. I do that and yoga plus I have hand weights that I work with. You will get more energy now without smoking and working out.one cigarette away from smoking full time...how do you avoid that? Never smoke again that's how!!!!! #109   bakon 17 November 2012 - 09:56 AM54- Went for wings and beer last night at Buffalo Wild Wings. Taste was great- ate HOT, which only 2 levels above and maybe 10 below. Burn was nice but the payback burn out the rear today wasnt. Beer was good- 3 tall Sam Adams seasonal Winter Lager....didnt think of a smoke at all. Not once.Walked out to go home and there is a huddle of 7 smokers near door. Must have been all part of same group because it was an unusually tight huddle, like a football one (not that English soccer football, American football type huddle where they pick a play) Looked stupid. Realized I drank and ate, not one thought of a smoke, until I saw my old spot outside where I used to huddle against the cold.Laughed to myself and walked by. #110  bakonPosted 19 November 2012 - 04:06 PM8 weeks. 56 days and over 1100 avoided. Pretty cool. Marching on. youngster513Posted 19 November 2012 - 04:20 PMWay to go Bakon, this is great how you keep this diary of your journey. You will look back on this in the future as a great memory! KTQ bud!  #113  bakon Posted 22 November 2012 - 09:54 PM60 Today is Thanksgiving. Was easy and food tasted great.Yesterday was easy until I had a few beers...Then my friends were firing up. Hit me hard out of the blue. Normally I smell smoke when out and hate it. Not then, could taste it and I had to struggle a little to keep from bumming one. Told buddy that one puff would equal a pack to me. Then another pack today. Made it through but suprized the draw it had. No thoughts today and so glad that burning turd never touched my lips. Have to be careful around the beer and others who smoke, still not a cement fixture. #114 bakonPosted 25 November 2012 - 10:16 PM64- Couple of posts I made somewhere else ....Thoughts on relapse...I have lost year long quits. Two year quit once. Why, because i wanted to smoke and be part of all that went along with it. Didnt want to stay free of it. That simple.When you quit smoking there is a change in mind and body, which is more enjoyable the longer the quit. I left my quit behind because my crowd of friends looked like their smoking was better. So I joined them.Was it better.... your all from the nicotine train...you know what I was chasing. What things look like and what they really are is usually different once both feet have jumped in. It was not.Will you relaspe... only if you want to. That simple.Urges/Craves...Every urge you beat, you get stronger. The next urge is weaker. The mind grows to realize it cannot make you react to an urge. So again stronger for you, weaker for next urge. This continues until the urge is a thought.Thoughts are weaker still and the body makes no action. This goes until there is only occasional thoughts, then no thought.I am only at 2 months, and no thought of smoking unless I choose to think about it. Sure I smell it now and then, but it gives me nothing. No response. #115  Jude59 Posted 25 November 2012 - 10:21 PMYou're doing a fantastic job.  #116  bakon Posted 01 December 2012 - 01:49 AM70- no problems  #117  christine1960Bakon,I love your updates. I am so glad you are continuing to do well in your quit. #118  bakon Posted 03 December 2012 - 02:18 AM72- Not one thought today. Steelers beat Ravens too!Post made elsewhere:Seeing smokers and being bothered during early quit....Soon you will see smokers different. They are not getting to smoke. They have to or they feel bad. Soon they will look silly. Or perhaps you will feel sorry for them. Too bad there isnt a magic shot to get off the nicoteen. Whoever invents that will be a gazillionaire. Dont know anyone who would not quit if there was no pain.One shot, your done, no pain, no moods, no stink. I gotta go down in the garage and get to work on that.On getting nonsmoker husband involved with early quit...You need to share some thoughts with your husband. Most of us are pretty dumb with the feeling stuff, so guidence is needed. And usually while a man listens he is thinking "What do I say to help, how do I help,..." Men dont usually just listen and go "OK" we arent programmed that way. We are fixers, not listeners. So figure out how to say it. "Hey I'm not asking for help, but this smoking thing got me messed up,....or I know you dont smoke but this stuff is hard, my skin is crawling can we go...to help get my mind off it"Give us husbands a chance to screw up. But point out your just venting, not looking for answers.Its too easy for us to say "Just suck it up and dont smoke" because they dont know how to fix it and are frustrated. Dont frustrate an idiot, help them help you.  #119  TimidTulipPosted 03 December 2012 - 06:16 AMHI Bakon, great to see the latest update. Very happy for you that you are marching on with your quit!I noticed smokers outside a pub yesterday, they looked frozen. And pathetic. I had a little chuckle to myself as a walked on by into the dry and warm, happy and content that I never have to interrupt my evening to go and get rained on and frozen stiff, just to get nicotine.(I love that husbands try to fix everything, it's so sweet. If not always successful  )#120  youngster513Posted 04 December 2012 - 01:17 AMGood job Bakon!
#121  bakon Posted 06 December 2012 - 01:59 AM75- Went to motorcycle club meetings last two nights. Worried about these when I started quit. Didnt phase me one bit now. Kind of breezing though now. Got gainsey as the same quit date too, along with youngster. So more eyes watching I dont fail. Not that I want any smokes, but would hate to reset counter and admit it to anyone here. Never met anyone here, but wouldnt want to disappoint either. No worry of that right now. Christmas smells are popping up. Cant remember last time I smelled a holiday. #122  BAH Posted 06 December 2012 - 04:02 PMFunny how we build something to be so big in our minds and turns out to be nothing.I am watching you too  #123  bakonPosted 12 December 2012 - 10:18 AM80- four days off, no problems.Have to watch I dont become anti smoker, not just a non smoker. Had Christmas party at a Firehouse. Usually guys smoke in garage but tables were set up in there. Smokers were going outside until...they decided to hide in a corner of the garage. Started to smell it and went looking...well did say something to a pair of them about taking it outside. Didnt work but before I took it further I realized it really wasnt up to me. No rules or signs or anything. Plus leadership all smokes so only could rely on their sense of not smoking around the kids. My wife couldnt smell it so maybe I am overly sensitive to odor. Anyways I dont want to be the enforcer of not smoking. Just want to be a non-smoker. Never liked the guy who preached because he quit. #124  bakon Posted 14 December 2012 - 10:37 AM82 1600+ smokes. Ok today. Just a copy of a post with someone struggling after 20 days. I remember that time of good and bad days. When your not sure you want to stay quit due to not knowing how to live without the habit and the roller coaster of mind games...Sounds like your body readjusting to not having so many chemicals in it . Enjoy the pain, it's healing your feeling. Body and mind will take some time but it will end all the sudden. One day soon you won't think smoking is the cause of anything You will be past it. It's too easy to blame withdraw for everything. It's not withdraw, it's getting better. Years of smoking and everyone wants three days to be the only struggle. It takes more than that. #125  youngster513 Posted 14 December 2012 - 03:12 PMDoing great bakon! I'm doing good as well! #126  bakon Posted 15 December 2012 - 10:35 AMGainsey still around too. Saw him post the other day. Good job #127  bakon Posted 25 December 2012 - 11:13 AMThree Montrhs. Christmas Day. No urges in forever. No problems. Little weight gain but nothing to worry about.

No problem. Had to shower when I got home to get smell off of others smoking. The smell is not as repulsive as the first month but I do try to avoid it.Newbies: at 4 months I feel a gazillion times better. Smoking is just about never a thought. All activites seem normal without it. Dont miss it one bit.Seems longer than only 137 days. 4+ Months make it sound longer, but back at day 2 is easy to remember. The struggle of every minute, every hour, thoughts of how can I make it even a week. It was minute by minute at times and nothing like today. It is really easy now.Its nice to know NOPE..NOT ONE PUFF EVER works. I never took a puff and I made it. No relapse or fighting it again and again. and I havent had one puff since my first post and going for a sandwich reward after making it one hour without smoking. #133  sintahbean Posted 07 February 2013 - 08:08 AMHave loved reading this, thank you! Mary #134  youngster513 Posted 07 February 2013 - 10:28 PMLooking good Bakon!t#135  Cristobal Posted 07 February 2013 - 10:45 PMbakon saidNewbies: at 4 months I feel a gazillion times better.

There are many Newbies here from january, they need to know this.All of this is true, but when your quit is new it is impossible to see this.Cristóbal#136  bakonPosted 08 February 2013 - 01:15 AMYoungster and Gainesy quit same time. They know the same thing Cristobal is saying. It doesnt take long to feel normal. At the beginning it feels like Army basic training. Your never going to make it. It hell and cant picture it being complete or over. Like climbing a mountain. I used to post "keep marching". It's a reference to an uphill battle or all the marching and hiking they put you through. Comparing the struggle of marching and quiting the shiitsticks. Put your head down and look at your feet if you need to, but keep moving foward. "Carry on" was a saying. A battle hyme of survival. Just keep marching and footstep by footstep the end gets closer.What's the end? Never an end, just the end of struggling. Longer for some. The march never really ends, but you crest the mountain and its downhill from there. Feet fall in front of each other, just got to lift them off the ground and let gravity pull them forward. Then you get in shape and you can go further and further. Walking/no smoking gets easier. Everyday/ every step is lighter.Maybe, eventually, the day comes when you fart rainbows and sing in the rain. Who knows? Just dont get all wrapped up in how hard it is. Enjoy the struggle because when its all behind you... the war stories come out and basic training was some of the best days of your life, because you completed it and moved on to better places. You will say it was hard at the time but not that bad. It was that bad then, but it is so much better now the sting is gone.  Like This#138  RedSkirtPosted 08 February 2013 - 09:32 PMbakon said137 days (roughly) 4 months 11 days.

I remember when you first came on the board. My quit feels remarkably similar to yours. Around the 4 month mark, I really no longer even thought about cigs. I, too, adherred to the NOPE philosophy. I took the option off the table completely and it somehow worked for me without too much stress. I cannot imagine ever smoking--or wanting to smoke--agin. And I feel ah-mazing!!!!Attitude is everything. Keep up the great work you are doing in taking care of your health and yourself. You deserve to be very proud. #139  bakonPosted 24 February 2013 - 06:42 PM5 months over 3000 smokes avoided.No problems, no urges, occasionally think "I used to smoke doing this." But no desire to light a turd. Smell of them is not offensive as before. But I dont like it. Avoid it. Some places still allow it, and when I do go those situations call for a shower when I get home. Went and watched some racing on Thursday, never drink in afternoon but was off and group of guys were going. Felt like I was missing it for about 20 seconds. Then someone says "You quit for a while now. How do you stand the smell?" This guy was a smoker. I know he is ready to start the trip to where I now am.For the newbies and those struggling...its gets easier. 99 percent of the time I dont think about it. If I stayed away from group it would be less. The urges and wanting fades.It fades expodentially. Longer away, better I feel about it. Was big and long part of my life so still comes up here and there, just very easy to handle. NOPE carried me when the group wasnt pushing me foward. Never want to reset that counter.Keep marching through, it turns out to be nicer with each step. #140  EmmaBunny Posted 24 February 2013 - 10:47 PMThank you for that encouragement, bakon, and congratulations to you.
you will see our new DANCER in the previous post. Also Youngster hit 10 months the other day. Relapse is very real.
God bakon fair play to you, that would have taken you forever to do but soo worth it,This is exactly what quitters need to be reading, it  helps them to know it's totally normal to feel how they are feeling and to know that their is light at the end of the tunnel is like music to their ears, great to see by really the 4th month you had found your comfort,  is great motivation for the newbies in first few days and weeks when it's hard to see the wood from the trees.I wish I had wrote my feelings down at the start, I would totally recommend anyone starting a quit to do, perfect to see how far you have come and when cravings hit helps to remind you how hard the start was and reminds you that you aint going back to day one ever. This should be added to the newbie package to get them to start doing the same and to see that someone else felt and went through exactly what they are going through. This and getting them to write their own sos would be extremely beneficial. Seriously thank you bakon for doing that, that is some amount of work you have put in, that's what paying it forward is all about,Respect xxx
This is great Breakfast food! Thanks for transferring your journey so that newbies can see. 
only one computer I access lets me ....got more....just going to take time to get it here...

The temptations are all around but never think twice about it. Saw a half a burned one in a friends ashtray ther other day. Looked at it like "I remember you. I remember how many times you tasted good for the first puff only to let me down with the second. Crappy taste left on my tongue." Smiled and walked away. Friend tried quiting soon after I did. Said the gum dehydrated him and still left him smoking at night. Cant put all the knowledge of this board out there in one conversation. Sounds preachy. How do you tell someone cold turkey is the best asnd easiest route when it sounds the hardest? and is the hardest at first. I didnt even try to explain he didnt really quit and made it worse with what he tried. Just thought to myself "He just isnt ready yet." I could see when I told him I hit 7 months he wished he was me.There is a good signature on one of the people with more time than me...something like ...So many times we feel we wish we were still smoking, and when we were smoking we wished we were here. #153  jimmy009 Posted 25 April 2013 - 03:07 PMkeep on marching forword 7 months is super way to go  #154  bakonPosted 22 May 2013 - 11:12 AMAlmost 8 months and last week was harder than normal. Was a vacation on the motorcycle and smoked a lot more than usual for bike week events in the past. Riding at day and drinking at night plus crowd is more smokers than a regular crowd. Just associated the whole event including the place we stay with the habit. Now I didn't pick any up. Bum any. Buy or borrow. But I did think about it more often and so had to stay on guard. Back home now and have no thoughts of it. In fact the smell has changed to me again. Not a pleasant smell but not like s*** either. Like the smell when I was a kid and an adult fired up. Didn't like it. Harsh. But not that stale klingy crap ashtray odor.  #155  slocumPosted 22 May 2013 - 11:35 AMCongrats on 8 months.Just remember, any junkie thinking is a lie. Smoking never did do anything for you and never will.  #156  EmmaBunny Posted 22 May 2013 - 12:43 PMI bet it was really difficult in that environment, but you held tight and made it through successfully! Congratulations for that. And thank you for reminding all of us that we need to stay alert.  #157  bakon Posted 28 May 2013 - 01:35 AMWife and I have been pretty good with the gym for a few years but I never spent much time with the cardio stuff. Knew I should not smoke was more important than riding a stationary bike for my health. And why get out of breath walking in place on treadmill. Again I was a smoker and three flights of steps could make me piss and moan. Avoid the cardio much as I could, maybe 5-10 minutes and move on. So hit some weights, fake a few sit ups and feel like I was doing my part. Well 8 months quit and I am ready to work on the heart and lungs now. Do some walking a few days a week with the dogs, maybe a 1-1.5 miles in a 15-20 minute route, depending on weather.Lungs and such feeling fine, dont piss and moan walking anymore. Steps or hills are fine. Working at gym still so muscles are stronger than most my age and not overweight, so summer is here and we are doing some bike riding.  #158  anna173 Posted 28 May 2013 - 01:47 AMcongrats!! Hang in there!! you can do this!! Unlike #159  scampNEWLY_REGISTERED2 postsPosted 20 June 2013 - 04:55 AMHi Bakon,I'm more a reader than a poster - Just thought I would post and let you know, that you have helped massively, a 40 year old married guy (20+ year smoker) sitting in Sydney Australia on the other side of the world,I started the journey 95 days ago, and especially at that time, i was googling and reading every article and forum under the sun, anything to to distract myselfIt sure was tough back then. For some reason your posts really struck a chord with me, and i kept returning and reading your thread over and over again over the weeks and months.That NOPE approach sure does work, i credit that simple concept with getting me to 95 days, as well as your "starting out" thread.I know i'm not out of the woods yet, but i'm thinking about it less and less, and it is so much easier to brush off than just a month or two ago.Anyway trust you are staying strong, and thank you from some one you'll never meet, but whom's taken such inspiration from your words and progress, - i bet you never thought as you wrote these, that later you'd be helping someone in Australia in getting the strength to beat the evil sticks !!bestscamp #160  bakonPosted 20 June 2013 - 03:31 PMScamp,thanks buddy. I am closing in on 9 months. I have been watching the "old timers" of the group, people with three months or more when I joined, now get their year mark. I think the group helped me alot and along with a counter I could watch the progress. I would recommend posting some here to help the others, but also get yourself a counter on your signature line. That little thing kept adding days and weeks. I never wanted to reset it and explain to the group that after a few beers I had no control over myself and ended up ruining the quit.Where am I now- well in the background here. Lots of folks saying exactly what I would and dont want to be a smart ass on some posts so best to move on and leave it alone. Other times I feel I got to be Mr Obvious and say the simple thing Pap would say to me when I was young.Thank you for the complements. Those really were my first posts and the progress went pretty fast. I go back and read it myself at times, but you made my day writing what you did. I will have a beer later for you. I have lost quits longer than this before, but never had a place to come and talk about it either. We have some things in common. Over 20 years smoking, I am just a few years older and although we both speak english, I find the movies with you guys talking hillarious. Those guys from England (One of my quit buddies Gainesy) are funny, but I have to listen to what they sat twice sometimes because it is so fast and pronounced so different.Welcome to the group and hope to read some more of your posts.

My H quit 12 years ago and while he is very supportive, he gets a little testy if I talk too much about the process (and pain) of my quitting. I think he IS frustrated that he can't just fix it for me and at the same time worried that I might relapse.  I was reading his testiness as his thinking I should just suck it up and get on with it.K
Men and women are different animals, forced by God to live together as a test.  When you accept that fact it becomes easier to see through the others eyes. Took me three wives but I got the current mrs figured out and she got my number too. 
Ha! I'm his #3 and he is my #2 but we've been married 33 years, with a few hiccups, so I guess we figured it out :wub:
#161  bakon  Posted 24 June 2013 - 12:02 AM9 months- 270 days approximately. Doing fine, smell smoke a mile away. Avoid it as much as possible. Had a conversation with an older guy who never smoked last night. He felt smokers were selfish and knew the stink they made but didnt care they made it. I told him how the nose didnt work and they really didnt know how strong the smell was but he wasnt buying the explanation. Said "These smokers think its their right to stink it up." The guy next to us agrees. Never knew some of the true animosity felt. It was like two teams that were at odds.So today we motorcycle ride to a nice scenic water fall in Ohiopyle Pa. Probably 1000 people in the area right above the falls, kids in the water, people laying out, and one lone smoke standing by the waters edge. Looked out of place and had an area of about 25 yards around him all stinking up. Like a 25 yard circle of stench. Nice beautiful scenery and probably enjoying himself, but ruining it for others near him or walking by. Never knew that cloud of stink when I was smoking. And my thought... glad thats not me because we did some walking around the area. Remembering not wanting to hike down to the far end because " I seen it before." That was the excuse so I didnt have to walk and get out of breath. But even if I did walk it I would have had two or three smokes while doing it. One near the falls, one when we finsihed walking, one waiting for the group. You know the standing around looking cool smoke before jumping back on the motorcycle. Plus had to load up the nicoteen for the ride. Well relieved I didnt want it, wasnt tempted, was repulsed by it, ect... NOPE from the start. Not one cigarette. Ever.Now some advise to the newbies....In the beginning, the first week or two and even occasionally for the first couple of months, give yourself some small rewards. That 3 days and the nicoteen is gone is a great saying but I found the first week to be a butt kicker at times. Reward yourself for making each day. In the beginning it is important to give yourself some treat for the work and commitment this takes. A magazine, a milk shake, a book, a new pen, whatever small item helps you feel slightly better and you wouldnt normally buy. A treat because in reality you gave up something and it is hard.You earned it.Then put your head up and keep marching. #162  JTPhilly Great update Bakon - congrats on 9 months! #163   babs609  Excellent bakon!!

Well done. #170  bakon Posted 09 July 2013 - 09:04 AM9.5 months- All good.  New site. Thought I would post an update, but nothing big to report, no problem, no desire to smoke, so I thought I would copy and paste a post I did today to a newbie who quit with her spouse. And this can be switched to a husband or wife. I think the quit is hard and to have a partner the group needs to pressure them to stay quit together. Sure their quits are independant, but two should be stronger than one and we should push staying quit together.So this one is her first day and he smoked again a half day into the quit. Group is encouraging her to stay quit (all good) but forgot about him already. She asks if the smell will bother her. I say he can come back and still can quit with her, just grab NOPE and move on.   Its your quit but nothing says you cant get on his ass about his quit.  You will not find his smell pleasant and want to hug or kiss. Soon your nose will start to work and cigarettes will smell like a pile of crap. You also need to distance yourself from the smell. This is to help you want to stay quit. Show your husband this site,let him read this post, tell him I gave you the ok to be a bitch about it. Dont cave because he did. Quiting is hard. Tell him to grow a set and show he can do it to. Not ok anyomore  to have kids and smoke. This generation cant watch us and think "Dad's cool and he smokes." Time to be a man and a father and give the proper example. Wouldnt want one of thier teachers giving out smokes or saying its no big deal,so he shouldnt either. Never too late to be a role model. Have him join and get counters to show what you earned. Also give small treats or rewards each day the first week as a payoff for quiting. A magazine, a ice cream, a new air freshener for car. Anything you normally skip or wouldnt buy.  I am serious on how offensive the smell will be after a couple days and even brushing teeth wont remove the smell from his clothes or hair. Tell him less lovin and he might come back around. A quit buddy helps alot. This site does too. But sex is a true motivator on a primal level. #171   ChristaC  I love these success stories! Thanks for posting it, bakon! #172  bakon Posted 23 July 2013 - 11:58 PM10 months- Made it to mid summer and not one. NOPE. Hope my quit buddies are still marching. Havent heard from them or seen them here but life gets busy once you quit. Remember the boredom of first quiting...what am I going to do with myself after diner, while working... well dont know where I found the time to smoke.Was in the store today, wife standing next to me in a dog treat aisle, smell of something really foul comes over the area.I say "Man it smells bad here, like crap of something" I am thinking some dog did his business near the area since dogs are allowed in the store. What I didnt realize was a woman walked up and was looking at the same stuff and smelled of the worst burnt cigarette ever.Like an outside ashtray or a half burnt, stubbed out smoke in a pocket. Once I figure out its a smelly woman I have to cover my tracks so I say to the wife "If these treats smell like this, the dogs are never going to eat them. Lets get out of here." Woman didnt catch the remark was made for her but I know my wife did by her tone the way out of the store. So she's pissed I embarrassed her. Oh well no blood , no foul. #173  islandgirl Congratulations Bacon on your successful quit. I love hearing about your journey, very inspiring. Your right I do  deserve a treat...we all do!...I'm having fun thinking about what I can treat myself too tomorrow? I really love to take a shower, get clean clothes and hug all my friends and family, all day long, every day. Talk about freedom to love! Again thank you for stopping by, you put a big grin on my face, I thank you very much! #174  guy alex hey Bakon,thank you for putting a smile on my face this morning,i really enjoyed your story about the smelly woman.congratulations on the quit.#175  JTPhilly Congrats on 10 months Bakon!  #176  SallytheOwl Posted 24 July 2013 - 03:00 PMCongratulations on 10 months Bakon! I'm only at 2 and it feels like forever. You know how time flies when you're having a good time and basically comes to a grinding halt when you're not. Looking forward to making it to where you are. Thanks for the inspiration! #177  Gainesy71 Posted 24 July 2013 - 03:11 PMHi Bakon,good to know your doing fine.I like to check in and see how yourself and youngster are doing.Cant believe its only another 8 weeks to our 1 year anniversary,really proud of myself and very happy that your still about and flourishing.Take it easy my friend.Iain  #178  Cristobal Congratulations on 10 Months Bakon !!! I am stil trying to catch you, few weeks behind you in time, I hope I never catch you !!!  CristóbalDay 283#179  bakon Posted 26 August 2013 - 10:25 AM11 months-  two week trip on motorcycle and loved not having to pack two cartons of smokes and leave clothes behind. Hope youngster is doing fine, Gainsey was here last month so he should be checking in. Crysobal ansd freliz are stiff hanging.Time is flying now.  See some struggling on older members, but I think its just thoughts. Nobody really wants a puff. NOPE is still my motto but was thinking of "stress is for sissies" Don't think it would work though, people are too sensitive and would get insulted. Well off to lunch or bicycle ride later. Would never want to ride one a year ago, would have put me out of breath. Cant remember last time I was out of breath since I put the lighter down and threw the smokes out the window.  Keep marching it gets easier. #180  Gainesy71 Well done bakon.Pleased everything is going well.Take it easy my friend.
#181  SallytheOwl Thanks for the check-in bakon!  The next one will be your OP blowout party!  #182  Terri Congratulations on 11 months Bakon, thats fantastic.I can't wait to see myself where you are  #183  sintahbean I really appreciate you sharing, its inspirational for me..KTQ #184  bakon I still remember those first days. This board was great when someone posted a supportive message. Out of the blue a stranger helps with just a kind word, or saying what you feel is normal. Just a little shove knowing you are in the right direction. Then Crisobal made a year pledge post. I decided to Stick around for a year, pay it forward, help someone else but also myself by reminding where I came from and stay on the right path. I watch that Chantax commericial and see the fine print where they report a high percent of success "with support group". Thats what this place is. I took one pill that first day. Was expired by a year but the replies from the group on the second day are what got me through. Nothing fun in quiting, it was work, still is. But not hard after the first steps, gets easier with each one. Sometimes I relate it to the forced marches in the Army, put my head down and keep stepping, moving forward until it gets easy. Soon enough the momentum carries me forward, then it becomes down hill. Keep marching. #185  baffled Hey bakon, thank you for posting this thread and keeping it going.  I have read it through once already and now I go back to your posts that match up with where I am currently and it is helpful.  I especially like to read all about your rides and the keys.    By the way, I have my head down and I am marching!  #186  bakon Two weeks till the years mark. One amigo is missing for a few months but I think he will be back. Bunch of us will hit it within weeks of each other. Gainsey, Cristobal, Frezil, Mariem, Youngster, sure I'm missing a September/October quiter...Some already there who were new with me. Pretty exciting since I made the one year pledge to check in. Dont want to smoke and the smell keeps me away. Only think about it when I check in here or smell it in a distance. Up close it stinks. Again no desire and avoid it as much as possible. Got about 20 extra pounds in last year but didnt work very hard at keeping it off either. Summer is beer time and I enjoy summer. Fall got some good beer too so not worried about the extra me.Last night did an organized Harley/concert ride. 200 bikes going to ZZ Top and Kid Rock which had police escort and had premium parking, pre-ride party and [beeeep] grass seats. Good time, nice ride, saw many friends who rode and some who didnt ride but walked over to see group pull in. We had some beers. Only one guy in our group smoked but inside the concert- every other person was smoking. Got the headache from it. Music was great and weather too, my only complaint- smoke. Cigarette and dope. Guess I need to stay out of the cheap seats and stay in the seated area or other venues which dont have smoking (inside concerts have no smoking).Got to decide what my year treat will be...suggestions?  #187  SallytheOwl You will have racked up over $2000 in savings.  Anything in that price range jump to mind? #188  bakon Spent some of that at the $1000 mark. But maybe I can use the other $1000 on something good at Christmas. Not now, probably dinner and a motorcycle part in the $100 range, since everything Harley cost $100. I tell the newbies to treat themselves to something small all the time. Magazine, dinner, anything they would normally skip but would make them feel good as a reward for quiting. I think the early days of a quit are work, that most people dont appreciate, so those treats can keep the first week tollerable to the quiter. I bought a subway sandwich after my first hour. Going to do it again for lunch the day I hit a year for sure. Whole foot long too!You will have racked up over $2000 in savings.  Anything in that price range jump to mind?  #189  baffled Hey bakon.  I wanted to bump your thread because I like tracking my quit timeline with what you were going through at that time.  Plus I enjoy your posts.   This thread has been so helpful to my quit.  Thank you!!!! #190  Cristobal bakon, on 08 Sept 2013 - 4:16 PM, said: Two weeks till the years mark.

Gainsey, Cristobal, Frezil, Mariem, Youngster, sure I'm missing a September/October quiter... I know that Marcie, Frezlis, you, myself and my wife Miriam have kept our quits. I came to The Board at Day 36, but was watching in those early days the quits of other who had quit dates close to mine. Dancer unfortunately relapsed, I was hoping very much to celebrate my first year anniversary together with her, her quit date was 15 October, one day after mine. I have not seen Gainsey73 or Youngster for a long time...I really hope they come here and let us know they are OK. Both of them appeared to have strong, healthy quits the last time they posted comments. CristóbalDay 333 #191  bakon Gainsey added me as a friend recently so I know he's looking. About a week left till our year. I still post because of your idea on the year pledge. I do rarely think about smoking except when I check in here. I don't want one after posting, but it reminds me where I came from. Seeing the beginners struggle a little, I know that feeling. But I really come to pay it forward. The help I got from Babs or Breath, M, Hockeymom,  or Pilgrim, Kinkash, Katiem, there was so many I cant remember them all. Then meeting some quit buddies, youngster, you, freliz, jt philly, maciem, all the people starting at same place with close to same experience.then seeing some people with similar stories, or from close by to me Monojo, all nice times and cant be repaid to them. I try to pay it to the newer people. But like any story, this one got to end soon. In a week the story will be a year old and time for change. I really appreciate anyone who helped, and the board is moving forward with new batches of people that really push it on. Cristobal, Jimmy, Jenny, list can go on. But I have seen most members fade once they hit a year, and soon it must be me. Just a new phase in the quit. I know I missed a bunch of people here- but thanks to the whole group. I might have made it alone, but I know I did make it with your help. #192  kinkash Posted 13 September 2013 - 12:00 PMbakon, on 13 Sept 2013 - 09:43 AM, said:Gainsey added me as a friend recently so I know he's looking.

No advise to share that isnt out there being said by everyone else. Had a good weekend ride and overnighter with some Blue Knights. One smoker in group. She was embarrassed by it and walked away to keep the smell from us. We were even in a smoking bar at one time and she went outside to smoke. Partly so we didnt see I think. AND not cool to be a smoker anymore. Total 180 from when most of us started, so we would be cool. But noticed that ich on her. Every stop, first thing in morning outside, slave to the nicotine. Got to calm that urge. Smoking defiantely causes more stress than it removes. That calm is only temporary, once the level drops the stress starts going back up. Guess I'll comment on stress. I work a very stressful job and think I have very little stress in my life. Seriously can have 30 things happening at once in three locations with danger in all of it, and I feel like its not a problem 99 percent of time. As long as people do what they are supposed to do, thing roll along fine. But people cant do that, and thats where I have to get involved. I hear "stress caused..." so much that stress has very little value to me. Probably why it does work as an excuse for bad behavoir to me. I remember back to the Army and there is no acceptable excuse for not listening or following directions. Try to give one and more likely to get more pushups or running or duty, whatever the Sgt felt like dealing out. Easier to take your lumps and say "No excuse drill sgt."Smoking because of stress just sounds stupid. Smoking only builds it. I watch the ich on people now. On a call...someone will ask "Can I have a smoke and I will tell you what happened?" I make them wait a few more minutes, let that stress build more on them, more likely to tell the truth and get to the point when under pressure. Why let them fire up and relax? Let them formulate some reason or excuse or lie to get out of whatever stupid thing they did? Just another observation. Like a referee of life...I just call it like I see it.Lets have a good week as the ride is coming to an end soon. #195  sintahbean Here is to a good week Bakon, will miss the ride with you.Do drop in every now and then.  #196  bakon A new member, firefly, is a friend. Everyone jump in and give her a hand when she posts.  #197  HonorAmongstThieves Oh this is emotional, and I am not even involved. lol. I cannot wait to be where you are now.But I will trek on, one day at a time until I get there. Thank you for this late night motivation. #198  SickofCigs9813 Bakon, I am new, and you are marking your one year anniversary date. I have read every single one of your posts, from beginning to end, and now... your 1 yr date implies that you are leaving. I have gotten SO much out of your fascinating posts. Interesting to note, that where you live, that bars allow smoking in them STILL. It has been outlawed in Calif, for over 20 yrs. (or thereabouts) Also FYI, they outlawed smoking at public beaches here too. I guess they didn't want the sand to become 'one big ashtray..' lol bad joke. In bigger workplace bldgs and even some not so big, they have signs that say, no smoking within 20 ft, of bldg. As early on, as cali was for the crack down on cigs, I am surprised that it is allowed in other states to this day. I hope you don't 'move on' from this group and the one year mark and consider it done for you in here. Your journal is great, but perhaps u feel u have said all u need to say at this juncture. well, maybe not... addiction never leaves us, it is simply arrested. I ve lost count of the x's I've quit, over time, but feel I don't have another shot at recovering anymore, this is the last hurrah. I've managed to live this long, (in denial about it killing me), dispite the loss of an ex bf who died 5 yrs ago, this past sept 5th, and was too young. he smoked on his death bed, and never once tried to quit. Reading you, was worth staying up in the wee hrs for. I hope you do return to us again, soon. Thank you. #199  bakon Posted 22 September 2013 - 05:44 PMTwo more days by my count. But will wait to see what counter says tomorrow. Going for beers and Steeler game now. #200  kinkashI love this matchup

Going for a Subway sandwich in an hour. That's how the ride started. Been downhill for a while but even still the group pushed me there. Advise to anyone- stay close enough to board that someone in here remembers your name. Good feeling to post after a week or three and see a familiar face. Also NOPE. Cant say it enough. Recommend everyone repeat it whenever you THINK its ok to maybe touch something which gives a puff. Don't play with fire. First weeks of crawling turn into a walk, then a march. Keep marching. Put your head down and plow forward at times, but soon it turns down hill and the ride gets to be easy. It was quick to become easy for me. Just a month or two and I think it was downhill. But I am on my guard too. I got lucky and it quickly was a foul smell to me. But also not completely done, some thought about smoking here or there, out of the blue, which isn't completely gone and still work to stay away from. So fight on, your stronger with every crave conquered, the roller coaster is worth it. Thank you to all my friends here I made it. Keep Marching #203  Nancy.We will keep marching! #204   ChristaC  Thanks, Bakon!

Sticking around a little to see the last Amigo hit his year. Plus like teasing Scott and Jimmy and some of the girls. Baffled posted about the habit and changing seasons, adjusting to not smoking even after awhile and having a trigger pop out of the blue. Not that I want to smoke but I looked at a half a smoke laying near a door the other day and thought "I used to put them out and sit them on a wall to light when I came back out." Anyways- I walked out of work late the other night. Like 20 minutes late and in hurry to get home. Always had time for 1 smoke on ride home and usually not finsihed when I pulled in driveway. Let dogs out and finish last couple puffs. So I know I'm in hurry and instead of firing up in truck I guess my routine was to fire up on way to truck so I could ge the whole thing done.So a year after quiting I am walking through the lot at work going toward truck, patting my pockets, looking for a lighter I no longer carry, to fire up a smoke I dont have, so I can finish it before I hit the house and go inside.Got to truck and I am patting again, double checking to find it. Need to find it before I unlock the door, need to get it lit before I get in truck and I am carrying other items. So I am switching them around in my hands and patting with the other hand, then realized I still havent found it and had to laugh. I didnt want a smoke, but that habit was still in my pea sized brain somewhere. Also dreamed about running last night- needed to run because I got a physical training test coming up and I smoke, so got to practice running before test.....Been out of Army 25 years now. Dont know where that thought was hiding. Changing title to pea brain. Had village idiot but that got used against me by an angry woman in here.#209  kinkash You rock Bakon! JT Philly posted something similar a few weeks back. It's all good!  #210  baffled Needed to repost Bakon at his point in my quit.  His quit seems so similar to mine that I like to know what he was thinking and posting at the same stages.  Thought it might help others as well.  Thank you thank you Bakon. #211  billquit Bakon..you're a full fledged inspiration!

I sure appreciate you and I'm real proud of you!+10000 #213  bakon 13 months and quit is very enjoyable. As time goes by, the bad memories of old relationships fade and only the good remain. My quit is like that. I have to think of something to find the bad in the quit. Sure I had moments of crawling skin and flying off the handle. But the end results are so good, so worth it, and so far from the cage of just a year ago, I cant think that it was too hard. I hope everyone reaches this point. Lot of posters recently saying it's getting easier. I tell them that's the downhill side of the march. I also think that as smokers, the first couple hurdles in quiting seem so steep that we postpone quiting. Then we start and they knock us down, hard. Moods, hunger, chemicals making us fart, break out and not sleep. We got to face the hardest part first, no easing in to it. So the failure rate in first week is highest, second week that goes down, continuing to ease with each day/week/month. But not a steady down, more a square function. , like gravity accelleration, 9.82 m/s2. Time is squared for how far it eases up. Sometimes there's a post with someone still struggling a month in and not easing up, usually some NRT going on nobody knew was happening and the nicotine hasnt left the building yet. I dont care how long you havent puffed, its not going to ease up till you quit the nic.Also love the saying a puff away from a pack a day- that and NOPE are my favorites. As for me, most of my quit buddies are at the year now. I would recommend staying close that first year. Some recent people come back who would have months to a year now, only to start again. Group is good about that, but I feel like it was a waste to let it go. The best posts to me are when they come back and dont gloss over the relapse. They say how disappointing it was. How the smoke didnt help. Some sit here fantisizing for nothing. Relapsers are the proof. Just ask a smoker if he would trade places with you, you give them the hard work and your one week quit and they give you the pack...they will take it. They cant get over that first hurdle.  Someone started a Million Dollar to Smoke thread recently. I cant say I wouldnt for that, but I wouldnt for the sake of just "having one." Too big of a risk for no reward. The relapsers all say that first one was so disappointing. See someone come back, ask them to post their thoughts when they got that first one in. Failure and disappointment.Someone had a line like "When we smoked we wished we were here. Now here we sometimes want to be there" Remember we dont want to smoke. That life is gone. SO for me- Easy Cheesy.Keep Marching  #214  bakon  1y 1m 17 d-Dont bump it up much because I dont have much to add. I dont struggle but an occasional thought does pop up. Not an urge, just a thought. Saw a lighter on the dash of a car the other day. Pushed it in to see if it worked. Came out glowing like new. Thought "This is a good one, heated up fast." Then put it back. Remember burning them out in my truck. Worn out from too much use. Could smell smoke a mile away now. Still dont like it. Gym is easy now than a year ago. So much more lung capacity. Walk twice as far, twice as fast, sweat but dont loose my breath. Smell things I haven't since being a kid. Lemons, real ones, not cut but on display. Could never smell that as a smoker. Sure I could smell lemon cleaners, or a fresh cut one. But not one with the peel on sitting a distance away. Teeth- whiter and no problems. Smile is improved. Skin too. I can see the gray in a smoker. Still marching. Head up and moving forward.  #215  Cristobal I am so happy that you are doing well. I understand many things in your last 2 posts, because I am at the same time in my quit as you. Where are Gainsey and Youngster ??? Are the 3 Musketeers only 1.5 now (You are 1, I am one half.).  #216  bakon Youngster is missing but Gainesy checked in at a year and doing well. Three amigos is now you me and Gainesy. M and Freliz are right there with us too. Your way more than a half. #217  bakon 14 months- all is well. Cristobal's name is still hard to spell for me but is still here posting away too. I always start typing CHRist....then got to go look at it again. I think English is my second language on the keyboard. Saw BABS, Sgt, Kinkash, and a few others post in the last week from last fall. M and Breath, Greenlover, Mojo. Got some crazy new ones too- looks like board is moving on just with enough flavors of personality to keep interesting. The owl is 6 months in. NK, Christa, Bill, baffled Jimmy, Jenny all in the middle grounds, months around 6 but less than 12. Never much into the fart titles. I think of brand new, less than month, 2-4,5-8, those 9-12 are old timers, then the big year and more group. I get titles, just don't use them in my head. Some pretty faces on some too on the avatars!! Scott from PA hasn't been hassled in a while about his pic, so I'll throw him in with pretty people. If I missed your name it only because my pea brain cant hold that much.(Saw the angry swimmer too, she cant see me though, only person I know blocked me. Funny is when she posts about NRT and her struggles at the beginning. Kind of verifies what I was trying to tell her on why her anger wasn't fading, just laugh to myself. It would be worth a warning point to say "I told you so" with my hand up showing her the international symbol for friendship. ) Notice I only wrote about the group. No smoking thoughts, only thoughts of some friends on the quit smoking group and check in to see how they are. Bike season is over, go around block now and then, but got smarter as I got older and don't go out much this time of year. Big plans next year already forming up. Going to hit the south. Big circle ,with PA and Ohio, about 15 states, including some places from the recent picture thread places. We are going to stop in Redstone Arsenal-Huntsville Alabama. Old Army post I was at for about 2 years. Hope to see some marching going on so I can get a photo. I could seach google for one I suppose. I did hit the chat button twice in last month. Both times I didn't know what I was doing. But one time I was only one in room. When I looked back Soul was in there. She was the fouth person to ever post to my thread and one of the original people I remember. So I start to write that and she Kieser Sozied "Poof " Soul left the room." Couldn't tell her what help she was that first week. I didnt know I had to be fast. Sat there looking at the screen with all I typed and nobody to read it left. Just me in an empty room that doesn't really exist as a physical space. The other time someone yelled "BAKON" and they scared me out of the room. (Was at work really but those chat rooms are a little scary) Otherwise just a lurker mostly.Keep Marching.  #218  Guest_susana_* I hope that is not a farewell post....  ... You have been a great support to me on these last few months. During and after my relapse. I don´t want you to go without knowing how much I appreciate your input and your non-judgmental tone. 14 Months tomorrow.... SUPER-MEGA-GREAT!!!  #219  SallytheOwl I never get tired of hearing how people have no more thoughts of smoking anymore. Keep those inspirations coming, Bakon. Congrats on your solid and comfy quit. Love it. #220  Nancy. Bakon, you are the best!
Well done.  Very good to see such success.
thanks trouble
Great thread Bakon
I made blog- but think something wont be right...attached external link to blog or something like that...think it will disappear if they delete it over there, plus I believe it is linking me over to the other place, which is not what I want. Any comments go over there? definitely not what I want? HELP  ok think I exteral linked this thread now...but blog this don't work.   I am computer dangerous, not good, not bad, no facebook or Skype, just slow moving news groups and threads. so pictures sometimes even get me but lately got some photosomething account and posted through there. anyways someone with the control buttons want to fix this mess, please remove my blog, don't know how it works and figure I did something wrong because when I hit blog this, it still says I don't have one, probably something to do with external link.Then come delelte this plea. my finger hurtys and I cant type no more todasy. I don't think you ever created a blog and instead just hit "blog this" because your blog is external only.  I'll delete the blog and you can create a new one and then blog each entry so it's all in your blog.  Once that's done, you can add all your new entries to your blog instead of this thread.  :)
Done.  Now just create your blog and I can help you with the rest.  :) FYI, I deleted all the links.  :)
bakonPosted 10 December 2013 - 03:44 AM1y2m17d. Cold out. Nothing to report. Sgt has disappeared. Cristobal has taken over the numbers game. Freliz been seen here and there. Lots of people have replaced the pharters. Don't like old pharters for a name but that's what we are called here. Told the thread we are the Pharos yesterday. Misspelled intentionally. We hit a year and we now rule.No smoking thoughts. Was at a stinking smoking bar last week for way too many beers. Paid the price next day. I blame the smoking and stench one time years ago while stationed in West Germany I drank way too much rum. That captain has been beating me up for years. But back to the point. I had a hang over so bad it hurt to blink. I blamed cigarettes and quit for a year. Both cigarettes and rum. Then 13 years ago I was back on rum kick. Captain beat me up again so no more rum. Fun on the beer so I stick to that. Rum and I turn Indian with muscles. Vodka I can't see less than two of everyone. Whiskey and I can't hold it down. One shot and everything comes back up. Strictly a beer hound. Have tried just about everyone but only have a few a month. Usually all at same time but last week I had two months worth. So it wasn't beers fault. It was the smoke and stink. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.Point of story. I have quit this long before. Don't like sticky quit but will say permanent one. No desires. Really dislike the smell. Can't see myself chained to that ball again. Especially in this cold , huddled around to get the fix to feel better. Such a bad habit. I like seeing the newbies at a day. Three days. A week. You can feel the excitement in some posts. Then read three months, relaxing some. Six. Well on way to permanent. Anything longer and they are Pharos to me. They rule the boardKeep marching. Lots of celebrations happening. #222   JTPhilly  Great post Bakon. Funny I used to live smoky bars thought the smoke assed to the atmosphere! I'm with you on the rum and vodka lol bit I like my whiskey.  #223   juanrmartino Posted 10 December 2013 - 06:26 AMBakon your post is priceless! Now better than yesterday, and how you describe things full of energy and optimistic, you inspire... im happy for you!  #224   Nancy. Posted 10 December 2013 - 09:26 AMnomorerumever Just channeling the Sarge!  I love your posts, Bakon! #225   Daisyjane2013 Posted 10 December 2013 - 11:59 AMBakon, I just read all the posts in this thread dating back to the beginning. It was really inspirational to read. Thanks for taking us along on your journey! P.S. I can't do whiskey either, Makes me crazy. Every night that started with a shot of whiskey has ended badly or in a bizarre way. Rum is fun when you're in the Caribbean, otherwise, I have to stay away. Tequila brings back some embarrassing memories from Spring Break 2001. lol! Don't ask. Beer & wine only for me too  #226   bakon "A man got to know his limitations"  Dirty Harry #227   mattjones36Posted 10 December 2013 - 03:58 PMbakon, on 10 Dec 2013 - 03:44 AM, said:It's funny you say that.

Maybe I cant get more redneck? (Not county redneck, not grown up redneck)Thinking about "reading from beginning" like Daisy did. So I started and got too tired to finish. I can give one update...MY SON MOVED OUT. Its sooo nice. See him weekly but glad he grew wings.   #230   baffled bakon, on 10 Dec 2013 - 1:12 PM, said: "A man got to know his limitations"  Dirty Harry With you on this one!  I don't drink very often, maybe 2 or 3 times a month when out with friends.  Husband doesn't touch the stuff.   Since I quit smoking though, I cannot drink as much and I get hang overs now.  I am blaming not smoking cigarettes.  Hopefully its not a function of age .... BUT I love rum.  Mmmmmm.  #231   bakon Posted 12 December 2013 - 03:47 AMI love rum too. Just that captain fights me every time and I lose every time. Beer never gets mad at me and makes everybody more interesting and better looking. Especially the non smokers. Smokers look funny to me when drinking. Got to light up more cuz the alcohol removes the nicotine from blood faster actually feel pity for them because they can't help themselves. At least hang overs now don't have that sore throat and yuk mouth from over smoking.  #232   baffled Posted 13 December 2013 - 07:20 AMI don't know what was worse before, the hangover or the sore throat and yuk mouth --- and sore chest from smoking so many extras while drinking.  Ughh.  Beer goggles, huh?  Too funny.    #233   bakon 1y 3m 1d- Christmas. Nice to not smoke on my second Christmas. Food taste better. No need to go outside in cold or sit in garage. 9150 plus smokes missed. That's a whole lot of bad breath missed, so definitely more smooching going on this Christmas. Placed a chair under mistletoe to eat cookies and kiss. Anyone want to stop by I am home. $2500 saved. Not really. Been rewarding myself. Got a Harley automatic winding watch and a large toolbox/workbench for myself for being so good this year. Santa doesn't pay enough attention to really know how good,... so I treated myself. All quiters need to do that. Reward yourself.  Keep marching.

Got some things to finish first before I get to take naps after lunch. #239   bakon Posted 03 January 2014 - 09:40 AM1y3m10d Bump cause I cant copy and paste it. Rolling through New Years just fine. Smelled it yesterday. Actually tasted it as I walked into somebody's cloud. Glad I don't have that taste stuck to my tongue anymore. Coating my teeth with yellow. I watch people who say they cook, then see them outside smoking. I know they cant taste what I do. Remember the temperature being very important. If it wasn't hot then it didn't matter what the taste. Probably cause all the taste buds were coated with tar and crap. New years Resolution- No biggie, just slow down and enjoy what I already got. Enjoy the small stuff I guess. And add new colors to my crayon box.Attached Thumbnails Keep Marching. #240   Gainesy71 Posted 05 January 2014 - 05:51 AMGainesy is still alive!!,still quit with no intensions of quitting the quit.Have been in and out of hospital for the last 4 months after an accident so have not really been lurking.Glad you are all doing well.

Julie and Bt in here (Wiley) when he was a fish, evolution I guess bakon Holy crapfish batman. We are back to three with Gainsey.  Tell us more about the accident. Glad your back for sure. Need three to be Amigos, (and we got a real Mexican too.)  #242   Gainesy71Holy crapfish batman. We are back to three with Gainsey.  Tell us more about the accident. Glad your back for sure. Need three to be Amigos, (and we got a real Mexican too.) Hi Bakon,glad your still around and prospering.I got knocked off my bicycle back in October and broke a leg,fractured pelvis,broken arm and a few other minor injuries.The chap who knocked me off was an old fella in his early nineties who panicked when he saw me and just couldn't control his car.Nice old boy who has my utmost admiration as he was a spitfire pilot during Battle of Britain so I hold no ill feeling towards him.....it was an accident after all.He has retired from driving!! And comes to see me regularly and I'm doing ok and should make a full recovery.Whatever happened to youngster....any ideas?.....although it's cool having an authentic amigo in the pack!!. #243   CristobalPosted 07 January 2014 - 11:32 AMI am so happy to finally have news about you Gainsey !!! I am sorry to see that you had the accident I hope you have complete recovery from this, let us know how you are doing and also big congratulations to ypu that you are now a Olde Pharte !!! #244   Gainesy71you cris,very kind. #245   bakon Glad your back too. My hope is youngster is just busy. Never heard otherwise so giving him the benefit here. Far as accident, I knew you were not smoking. Saw you check in once, but anyways you got some story there. I wish I had an old vet to feed me a couple stories. Great attitude you kept. Hope your back on feet soon. And keep posting, not too many old timers (I dont use farts) helping out here. Got to pay it forward a little bit longer, then ride off to Mexico where its always sunshine and rainbow farts. #246   bakon Posted 24 January 2014 - 10:38 AM1y4m1h  16 monthsLiked when I logged on today and saw the extra 1 hour. Like my first post. Made it one hour and got a sandwich. Belly is not so big after this long. About 12 pounds more than start and I dont mind. Always say curves are good for the girls, why not the guys too? What I will comment on is missing smoking. When I quit I knew what I was in for. I had done it before when younger. Thought that made me a good smoker because I had quit a few times for over a year. Why was that good? Because in the circle of smoke, I was tough enough to say I could do it, I just didnt want to. Liked it to much to quit but I could and I got my past quits to prove it. So why didnt I quit? I thought I would miss it. How could sitting in the garage, putzing with my tools or motorcycle be any fun without lightin up and having a smoke hanging from my lip? I love smoking and putzing. Riding, drinking, chores anything with smoking. Where is fun if no smoke? I was one who could close one eye because the smoke was going in it, while leaned in, reaching around the back of an engine with both hands to tighten something. Still puffing, cause thats how you do it. Well it takes some time to relearn everything without the smoke. I kept at the putzing and earned my degree as a Doctorate of Putzers. I wash and wax anything. Tighten any bolt and adjust thingerabobs in my sleep. I cut the grass, drive to work, drive at work, drive home from work, putz and drink beer all without thinking about smoking at all. Not missing it one bit. Not sure when I started to enjoy all this again without smoking. I know I enjoy not smoking and I enjoy putzing, just not sure when I started enjoying them together.It happens though. You reach a point where its all back to normal, just no smoke.(pictures removed)  #247    Soberjulie  Posted 24 January 2014 - 10:44 AMI just read through all of this thread.Amazing. Simply amazing Bakon, thankyou for keeping a kind of QSMB journal. Watching the days click by for you is inspiring to read about  #248   ArmedNAruba Posted 24 January 2014 - 11:23 AMKiller accordion concert dude!!!  #249   bakon Octoberfest at Penn Brewery in Northside. I did spend three years in Germany with the ARMY. Was even there when the wall came down.  Accordians-Cant say I love it, but it does make me smile after a few beers. Beer, love it all the time. #250   ArmedNAruba Posted 24 January 2014 - 11:58 AMGotta love the country's traditions!! #251   bakon Posted 27 January 2014 - 09:18 AM9800 missed...  #252   Guest_WileyD_* Thanks Bacon. I enjoyed that. Very helpful. I was in Germany 85 to 89 in the Air Force near K-Town. #253   bakonPosted 27 January 2014 - 10:02 AMI was on Bitburg airbase for meals and mail. Lived on housing for about a year too. Its a civilian air strip now. I googled it. Spangdollem was 1 air miles away and 10 km by road. We drove by occasionally on way to a sight. Was at K-town about every couple months to shop at bigger BX/PX or to go to our battalion hq for something. Had a Burger King and was a treat. Was there from 12/86 to 1/90.  #254   Guest_WileyD_* I was at Sembach AB. I miss the Brew & the Food. I loved it there. #255   bakon Posted 27 January 2014 - 10:44 AMDont think I ever stepped on that one. What planes mostly? was that the A-10 base? There was one of those down there. Bitburg had F-15 and Spang had F-16 with F-4 (I think). I was in Missiles, defending the air bases hiding in woods. We were to shoot down enemy planes attacking the bases. I guess when the air force was sleeping, we had to watch over...just kidding. But when we ran PT on base we couldnt sing cadence songs, we were waking up the air force to early. No kidding, the base commander said we wouldnt be allowed to PT in their gym first (cold and wet outside all year in germany) with push ups, sit ups and all the crazy army jump and whatevers. Then we would go run as group, but no singing until flight line because we woke the AF up. We loved that. Also had SGT Major who hated all those officers in blue that were pilots, so when we saluted we were to say "HAWK (our missile) If it flies, it dies" We didnt, cause most pilots couldnt give a s*** if we saluted or not. They were on a different level, like playboys of the military. Envied those guys.  #256    Soberjulie  Posted 27 January 2014 - 11:28 AMBakon, you were there when the wall came down? How cool.I had a patient who was there when the wall went up! She was just a kid.She was suffering from mild dementia when she was my patient and talked about the wall all the time.One day I found some pictures and told her the wall wasn't there anymore.....they took it down.She was so shocked. When she finally believed me she cried like a baby. She said "maybe now there can be real neighbor-li-ness"#257   Kennedy Yes this really does help!!! He gets it!!! Or he did...

Thanks for sharing this I used to go back to this thread at various times in the early stages of my quit because it was so helpful.  I wish there were more journals kept like this.  You may want to start one now.  That way, in a year when someone new comes along, they can look to your thread and say the same thing about you.  It really is weird though that you think all these people with time had an easy quit and that is the only reason they are fine today.  Not true.  We were all where you are now.  You will get to where we are before you know it.  One day at a time.   #259   bakon Posted 27 January 2014 - 02:34 PMOnly one guy really chanted easy peazy. A few seemed to get the right mind set early but most everyone goes through same thing. A couple people were big cheerleaders, posting for everyone and very helpful. I notice most of the old timers for me arent around. A few are still here, but most were less than a year ahead of me and moved on. Soon the newbies become the old timers. It really is quick.  Start a journal is good idea. When this began, people posted "day 1 ... day 2... day 5 ... day whatever". If couldnt judge how it was going unless I had seeen and remembered what they said. We are all here to learn, get support, or pay forward what we took from others. Along the way you meet some nice people. I got to pay it forward with this. One guy said he read this several times but only posted 1 time to this board, ever. Told me thanks. That was a great day.  Started this for me, but glad I got to share it.  #260   bakon Posted 06 February 2014 - 04:20 PM10,000 smokes missed. About 37 full days of smoking.  Don't miss it. I can smell the stale smoke on a smoker's clothes about 20 feet away without one burning. I can see the gray in their skin. Not much else to add. Advise I would give today....- NOPE.  it works.  Note 3-11-15   2 years, 5 months, 2 weeks, 2 days, 11 hours, 34 minutes, 24 seconds. That translates into 17,969 cigarettes NOT smoked, for a savings of $5,390.89! At 5 minutes per cigarette I have increased my life expectancy by 2 months, 6 days, 9 hours, 28 minutes, 13 seconds.
Nothing new except I don't know where I even had time to puff. Stick with NOPE and you can't fail  Peace. Out
Just a bump up
This journey has been a fantastic read Bakon....very inspirational for a Newbie. Best part of all is you did it! You won! Nope works. 
Thanks....just some pushes and shoves from people here and NOPE....all it takes...not really, its a relearn of basic habits and ways but once each is done it gets easier. Each holiday or season, chore or hobby....don't know how I did have time for it. Probably 20 lbs heavier, good 15 anyways, but its all good weight. Was too thin for height because I didn't eat good. Now I work out regular, watch what I eat and biggest health improvement is lungs, I can walk, run or climb stairs, ride bikes hike or whatever...activities I would pass on before because I would be short of breath before others, not weaker, just looked weaker when you cant breath after five times running up and down basketball court...So I still preach CURVES ARE GOOD.  Don't let weight gain bother you. As for gym, just go and move, don't matter what you do, just move.
You are right Bakon. I would rather have the CURVES  than the stink. I would rather be able to move & breathe. I would rather accomplish what you have. That will take time but I'm going to do it. I'm very stubborn.  And I WILL move 
Three more months. Pretty boring quit now. Hit three years soon and feel the fade. The train seems to have the elite quiters, most old timers that check in have gotten so busy with life. Time to roll. Like to see all the progress people made here. The group as a whole is pretty exceptional. People quit here and change their whole life. Kids, houses remodeled, jobs, bike riding, marathons, and the friends come and go. Met one in person and if I really wanted to, close enough to visit a couple others. Thing is, outside of here, we all have a bunch of stuff going on and don't know when we had time to smoke. And after discussing some of the characters in here and laughing we would move on and miss the person even more. So its good the summer picnic never happened. Good because we can all think of how great it will be when it does happen. SO smile and move on. As for quiting advise. I post threads with hints and tricks, ideas and suggestions. But only one thing remains common to all quits.... NOPE.    and that's all I got to say about that.....Forest Gump and Bakon

this thread really clicked with my rollercoaster life. though i have never done drugs, which most associate with addiction...smoking is exactly the same thing. if not worse. strength is hard to find sometimes.weakness is harder to admit. the first step is making an honest change...with yourself.i dont feel so weird about posting all my shit on here. happy anniversary, bakon!
Couple more months. Easy peasy

Little more time in Easy peasyLemon something Please don't feel all aloneThe Train is a Place to callHome Is it not amazing how the event of quitting smoking just disappears from your life ??? All the changes, dealing with the triggers, the adjustments a person experiences at the beginning of a quit eventually disappear completely from impacting your life. And then once the addiction is put to sleep, you find yourself alone with just *YOU* - not you *AND* the addiction. The feeling of freedom is just incredible, and it stays with you and grows as long as you do not smoke.  Cristóbal
Four years......its easy now. Someone posted lately "when were you confident in your quit?" I posted "Tomorrow". I believe I was sure a long time ago, but to be sure I will say Tomorrow I will know for sure. When you ask tomorrow I will say the same thing. I don't want to jinx it. Someday that answer might be "soon", but I wont give a date to be sure. What have I learned- nothing. I am still the village idiot and enjoy the position. Want advise- keep looking, plenty of folks to tell you right way in details. I am much better with the one liners and quick pokes. Say something dumb, I will see it and tell you. As for the group, good bunch of people, even let a couple of you in on Buddybook. Some of you would be a blast to have a beer with, some of you are stalker crazy and that's what makes it fun. Goal for the next year- meet a few more in person Regret- Biggest is not crashing the wedding and second biggest is falling for Sonic's trick of inviting me every few months to meet somewhere and he leaves me standing looking for a dance partner. Burritto would probably do the same if on the island but I think the Mexican would really show up. (Nancy too) Advise for others- slow down and enjoy the quit. Don't rush to be done, cause its never done, it just fades to the background at times.
Four more months. Back in the gym. No struggle breathing.  Still smell it a mile away. Wish o could think of a catchy phase like NOPE but for the smell. For women it would be Don't smoke.Smell like a girl. You get the idea.

One more month and some days
Long time-----My thoughts on be accountable to YOUR own self and quit  Actions determine outcome and outcomes inform actions. Be accountable. Taking complete ownership of your outcomes by holding no one but yourself responsible for them is most powerful thing you can do to drive your success. Accountable people absorb setbacks and keep going. Accountable people persevere and keep pushing forward. They are results oriented and never defend actions, skills, models or relationships that don't get job done. When life happens you can be the author of your life or the victim of it. Those are your only two choices- accountable or unaccountable  Most successful quits are done by those with this in mind. We can all help push but your feet have to want to move. 
Great post..and so true...x

I still post just to pay it forward but have to admit I also like teasing the shit out of people
Worth a read for any newbies or lurkers out there!
Thanks.
5 years. Don't know how many I didn't smoke by now but was a pack a day so I will call it a bunch. Money, didn't save a dime. Spent it on beer and one woman. Changes- health feels better. Better shape and no worry about what's in the future. Used to think at times I might have problems later, not Now. And if I do it's dumb luck, not something I could avoid. Nice worry to throw away.As for smoking....I don't want to, don't need to and certainly don't plan to, BUT after a few beers last night thought out loud with a few other previously smokers "I would have one if...." Our ideas of if were stupidly delusional but we all said we missed it if just a little...So danger present even if only .001% probable at this point. Don't ever let your guard down.Now to the celebration part...no Subway, five years means the wife will be naked at some point, beer and beef.  And finally the thank you part...thank you everyone who ever posted, to all the eggs a special treat to be delivered in person.  To the window lickers I send my laughs. And to anyone who ever just read my mindless ramblings THANKS. And as Porky says at the end...that that that's all folks

    Thanks for bumping that great post, Bakon.  I was on a plane when you posted that and totally missed it!  Comforting to see what there is to look forward to by just keeping the NOPE and putting one foot in front of the other.  Oh yeah, that's what you always say: "Keep marching."  Good advice.  It's working for me so far. 
Couple more months. Swear I coughed  today and tasted smoke. Not really but was in a smoking bar last week and bothered me at first.     But I could see without education how quits get fudged up in a bar.  Thanks to you animals, I am safe.  Don't reply to smoking threads, out of the loop on some newbies and fear insulting someone who don't get my humor.  So retired to socialize stuff, which is fun but taking a break from checking in five times a day. I will hit up for anniversary dates.Good luck to all in the year to come, may sunshine up your rear and make you warm and fuzzy. If you need to reach me anytime ask Nancy she can point you to me on buddybook.Keep Marching.Edited January 6, 2018 by bakon
    Hope you show up at times Bakon! I laughed at your Window Licker comments & valued your advice. You will be missed. But....enjoy your naked woman & beer...now that you’re a non smoker there’s more to life than The Quit ? We’ll all look forward to your Social Check In’s!!! ?

    It won't be the same without you.
    Take care my friend.    You may decide to come home and visit more often than you think depending on where life takes you. In any case, you've done your job both for yourself as well as passing on your knowledge and experience to others so go annoy the rest of the world now 
    Thank you Bakon....you have been a big influence getting this old horney toad up  to that Lido Deck,and stay there...   I will look forward to the times you drop by... Enjoy your fabulous non smoking life...I will miss those criptic posts if yours...Ta Ta for now ..xx
    Someone seriously got offended by your posts and humor? Newbies do not always know much of what is going on, do not let that keep you from stopping in here. I mean if the admins and mods are not on your case, nothing to worry about.
    I'm sorry but did I miss something? 
I don't think so. No drama anyway.       Edited January 7, 2018 by reciprocity

    I just want to say something..  Bakon has always been the  one to keep this place upbeat ,and keep the moral of the camp high...    I've read support letters he has wrote ,that have literally brought me to tears.... He's not the village idiot..he would like you to think....he,s actually a great guy,who will fight your corner....  I am going to miss him heaps... You have my respect Sir...  Doorbell !!!!!
    Bakon, you’ve been a source of inspiration, laughs, confusion and admiration- sincere thanks for all of it.  I hope this doesn’t mean you won’t be here at all but maybe just not as frequently as you take the time to enjoy the rest of your life more.   Xxi PT

    Hell to the no. Bakon needs to keep on sizzlin’ here on the train.  I actually got to meet this gem in person and he is awesome! 
    And just a quick addition to my protest of Bakon taking a break for fear of being misconstrued. No one here posts anything out of malice, so if you are hurt or offended by a post, reach out and ASK what was meant rather than thinking the worst. This board more than ANY other board is a safe space, not one poster here is malicious. 
  Idiot!
No problems.  No complaints on anything said. Just a slow down. Thank you all for the comments.  I quit 5 years ago and have many friends here, and many friends who have left...hate to be last guy dancing.....plus there are many here now who got the same style humor to keep it rolling....maybe after a lay off....but not quiting the group...laying back.  PS. Not one new friend request on buddybook.....

    June- still rolling. See some awful faces still here. Going to hook up with Saz next week for cocktails in New Orleans. Booger leaving town as I pass through, knew he was afraid of my shadow.

    Little closer to six years. Month away. Got called in for overtime over night. Tired and fuzzy but made it in. On the drive I am searching my pockets to see I got everything. Money-check, lighter....lighter...can't find lighter....wtf do I need a lighter for???? Laughed at myself and realized only need the money clip and to pull head out of ass.
    Boy I hope you hang around for my quit.  Right now I need some humor.  Right now I am just crabby, crabby, crabby!  Last night, while watching tv with my husband, he was crunching on stale cheetos.  With every crunch, I thought I could get up off the couch and strangle him.  Come on, who eats stale cheetos when their wife is trying to quit smoking!
    Some idiot is out walking a cat, on a leash, in the rain. Coffee in one hand, slippers and the dumbest part- smoking.  My job is like living in Wally World.
    Well bakon, might not have been much you could do since stupidity isn't a crime.        But for the scene, if you are an artist, you could design and patent that cartoon and maybe make a little $$$
    Six years....   Nope still working.  Amazing only need one word to quit.    No big deal. If I can quit...Anyone can.
My Mexican friend made his six.  Still pokes his head in too.       Couple of eggs still hanging also.      Sticks rocking the game.        some names have changed but place still kicking out free advice and good stuff too.         Son getting married in two weeks. Nothing else new.         NOPE. Still works fine. Edited November 14, 2018 by bakon
    Bump for.New years
The New Year will bring in my 5th month.  This has been a feat I never thought possible.  I love my smoke free life.  I am so grateful for every encouraging word that guided me through this amazing transformation!
June 2019....had to check in. Forgot exact quit date...couldn't remember how many years....had a smoking dream month ago....wasn't smoking but in my dream I couldn't run up a hill and was blaming smoking....keep marching

Little over 7 years. No interest in smoking. I see people and feel sad for them. Its a shame we ever did this but a guess it had its time. So glad I got some friends on buddy book from here and got to squeeze a few chicks in person. The eggs are a good group.     We are a weird group and when I check in there is always another weirdo who joined. Bunch of window lickers who common thread is ending something stupid we all did. Thank goodness there isn't groups for my other habits. There probably is but I'm not looking       Keep marching, head forward and take one step at a time. Don't look too far ahead and enjoy the process. Embrace the suk.
It is so good to see that Bakon has a 7 years quit.     We quit at aproximately the same time. My feelings about smoking at 7 years quit are the same as his: "No interest in smoking, and I feel sorry for people who continue to smoke".      If you are still smoking and reading this thread, remember the title of Bakon´s thread: "Starting now....."     It is never impossible to quit smoking, and you can start RIGHT NOW.            Cristóbal
    Congratulations Cristobal.  Inspirational......you were a massive part of my own quit ..
my 7 year quit buddies.
    Babbles was one of my first responders. And the Mexican is mi amigo 
    Good going bakon

    Here is an excellent vid about nicotine addiction    
    Remember, every crave you beat re-claims another receptor in your brain from nicotine.   
    Thanks for adding this great video, to this fantastic post.     Keep bumping it !!!         Cristóbal

Craving nicotine after work today. Ate great salad instead. Still craving. Remembered you'd bumped this.    Came here to watch the first video at this website. A good reminder of why I've quit.   Thanks again, Sazerac.
Nicotine will be gone from your body in roughly 3 days - not from your mind though. Remember why you quit and stay strong to that commitment. You can do it. We all have gone through the same thing so it is possible

You can do it. We all have gone through the same thing so it is possible      Right now, 9:30 pm on Pacific Standard Time, my last ounce of reserve I am using to force myself to go to bed for the night. Staying awake is giving too much time to experience cravings. I don't crave in my sleep.   I appreciate the 3 day reminder. It'd slipped my mind. I think this is the first nic-free day, but it might have been yesterday. I'll consider today day 1, tomorrow day 2, and then the last day to get the rest of the nicotine out of my system. Of course, the nicotine receptors will still be there, but the winnowing process will be under way. ok, going to sleep off the cravings.

And a big thanks from a middleagedbie!      I stopped reading and watching all things informative about smoking a few months ago, because I was doing so well. The last 1,5 month life decided to overthrow me with a sh×tload of life-events-crap  and tadaaa, the remaining receptors are having a blast. What a RELIEF to once again realise this is what its all about: receptors.      Nothing personal or failure or 'why me ahhh' related.. just receptors.  The one thing personal about it is healing and heading towards 12 months.
    Wow no wonder I was so crabby the first few days. Not feeling that way today thank goodness 
    With education about nicotine addiction you will begin to understand about the process the body/brain experiences.  It helped me immeasurably to know it wasn't just me being wacko, there were organic changes going on.       Every crave/trigger you beat deserves reward.   This assists your brain to deliver endorphins etc at appropriate times. You reclaim your brain. Sorry, if I repeat myself here but, it is really important.The Significance of Rewards
    Don’t be sorry I need all the help I can get! I keep telling myself I don’t need to smoke it’s just the habit now. But the habit is as hard to break.
Diane, Smoking/administering nicotine is not simply "a habit".You must address your nicotine addiction!     Chantix may make the withdrawal a bit smoother  but, it doesn't make addiction go away. You have to do the work to put your addiction to sleep  AND put to rest triggers/craves/body memories.  Chantix will not do this for you.   YOU need to do the work as @Nancy, with a successful Chantix quit told you.     Our friend, Joel Spitzer, helped me admit to my addiction and recover from it.  Go through this list of Joel Spitzer Videos they have helped so many.            Edited July 14 by Sazerac

    I’m  aware of the addictions of nicotine. Thanks for posting the videos. And I’ve watch those videos too. But the habit is what’s getting be now. I’m not getting anything out of smoking. The Chantix is doing it’s job. The don’t do anything for me when I lite one. I take that back I get a headache now when I lite one. That’s it. But I’ve smoked a very long time. It’s such a habit to go outside and have one. I’m working on that part of my smoking habit. I know from the last time I quit this was a hard part of quitting for me. 
It took me, and many people, a full year to go through all the seasonal triggers/craves and to change many habits.  I smoked everywhere all the time for 40 plus years. You may find this helpful

Please share, others might be inspired!        I took long walks, or went for a bike ride whenever I felt overwhelmed by the need to follow my former patterns. I told myself all the time: I am rewiring my brain. It helped big time to reach beyond the habit part.. which really isnt a thing actually... The habit follows the addiction... adress the addiction and the habit will vanish soon enough!

    The last time I quit if I went out it was alway somewhere I couldn’t smoke and it was a big pain to get to a spot where I could. I did this  especially if I was going to have cocktails. I changed the place I had my morning coffee. I took my car and had it detailed. I treated myself to little gifts for not smoking. Writing this is making me remember a lot of the thing I did that helped that I had forgotten about. Thanks for the video sazerac. And thanks to everyone for all your support.

I know from the last time I quit this was a hard part of quitting for me.           That's also what takes the longest to change ..... our habitual responses to any number of situations that crop up in our daily lives - including emotions. Happy, sad, bored, lonely, excited they all create an automatic response and that is to light up.       That's what the 1 Year Pledge is for. It's located on the Quit Smoking Discussion Page - pinned near the top of that page. It's an important reminder that it takes most of us a full year to completely recover - face and beat all our smoking triggers at least once (seasonal triggers included). That's why the 1 Year Lido Deck celebration is such a big deal. Once you get to that 1 year mark, you have truly arrived! Sure you may still have thoughts about smoking but you have proven to yourself that you CAN beat your addiction at it's own deadly game.        Yes this is an insidious addiction but there are also habitual responses involved because most of us have smoked for decades. Same response to triggers over dozens of years. All those need to be addressed when we quit. It can be overwhelming at times but it IS doable. That's why support here is important cuz we DO get it! You're not alone. You're one of us

Someone mentioned HALT and I dragged this up from my blog.  Babs had a great thread about HALT for which I am still looking.    Ahhh !  HERE is Babs thread on HALT and I will bump it, too.        I have read about the acronym, H A L T, in recovery paraphernalia   and have used it to a great degree of success   in changing my patterns from a nicotine addict to a Free person.    Having a Crave ?    H. A. L. T. Are you Hungry - Thirsty - need a deep breath of Oxygen ?   Angry - Happy - Emotional ? Lonesome - Bored ?  Tired ? In many, many instances, when I would reach for a smoke,    my poor body was actually trying to alert me that it needed attention in some way.  My addiction silenced these natural signals.    I still catch myself these days...no, it is no longer a crave,  it is my body hollering for water or food   or something it really needs !  Now, groovin' in my new freedom,    when these signals come up, my first thought may still be,  'Oh cigarette, dammit'  However, it is followed immediately by, 'No, not smokes...you're Hungry, baby !'    or, you're thirsty  or, you need to go sit outside and take a big gulp of oxygen and figure out what your body or spirit requires.  The piracy that nicotine practiced is still mind-boggling to me.    Allowing nicotine to take over my basic human needs of sustenance and comfort was a grave error on my part. I am grateful my body is so forgiving . I am grateful to be free.   Free and learning how to read my body's signals and remembering how to take good care of it.    So, next time you have what you assume to be a Nic fit, have a think...what is your body really telling you ?   It won't be hard to figure out. For me it has been obvious and I have to wonder,    how could I have neglected my body for so long ?    It is a miracle it survived.            Here is our friend, Joel Spitzers,"Do You Want A Cigarette....H.A.L.T"               Edited October 10 by Sazerac

Hello darling smoke free creatures, You know, even after over 4 years quit, I  can still catch myself thinking...' oh, time for a smoke'.   It doesn't trouble me anymore because now I am able to identify what I really need.     It is not, never was and never will be 'a smoke'.   It is most often a glass of water, a break, a deep clean breath.    The concept of H.A.L.T.     (Hungry, Angry, Lonesome, Tired)    is still tremendously helpful and keeps me current and present with myself.     I hope it may be helpful to you, too.   S
    Sazerac, thanks for finding this and bumping it.  I find not only helpful but spot on for me at the moment.  
This happened to me last night! I was hungry because I missed breakfast & lunch. About 7:00 PM I really felt like I should be going for a smoke. That's because I used to suppress my appetite by smoking. Was immediately solved when I ate something
    This is very true, the cigg was my friend! Lyric from the white stripes "Back and forth through my mind Behind a cigarette".. Great thread, thanks for sharing
    bump.   Make sure your read Bab's link in the original post too.    Identifying what your body is actually asking for is incredibly enlightening.

Bump for @Juanrmartino2 and all of us.  Pay attention to what your body requires !
Hello Everyone- I was on this board a little over 3 years ago and I'm happy to say that my 3 year anniversary is coming up in November.     I used to read and post here everyday and then all of a sudden one day, the board was gone. I'm not sure why I didn't get any notification. I think I may have stopped logging in and was just reading so maybe that's why I missed it, I'm not sure. Well - as it turns out I had a user name here after all and I was able to retrieve it and log on today. I'm here to say "thank you" to all the veterans here and to pay it forward to all the new quitters too.       I'm doing really well but I will occasionally google "quit smoking..." and today I stumbled across this site, I seem to remember it was "Quit Smoking Message Board". I do recognize some of the names and I'd like to say that I'm so grateful for everyone's help on my journey. Without you and everyone else on this board at that time, I don't think I would have been successful.        For all you new quitters out there, the difference in this quit from all the others (after 40+ years of smoking and trying to quit several times) is that for the first time I followed the instructions here. I read every day, sometimes ALL day and when I needed help, I asked for it. I listened to the advice. When I wanted to smoke, I posted and waited it out. Each and every time someone helped me and I got through it. Little by little the days added up, the craves became less and less. Several weeks later I experienced my first morning where i woke up and realized that 30 seconds had elapsed and I hadn't thought about smoking! That's when I knew I could make it LOL        I didn't even WANT to quit, you don't have to want to - you just have to do it.  But I was so fed up with myself, I hated that I was smoking. I'd lay in bed at night and promise myself i wouldn't smoke the next day - but you all know the end to that story - tomorrow, tomorrow adds up to years. I was determined to stop but I wasn't happy about it. I was angry about it. But I knew I was slowly poisoning myself.         I can't imagine myself as a smoker again. Of course I have thoughts now and then and I know I "can" smoke if I want to but I don't want to smoke! I used to envy smokers but now when I look at them, I feel........nothing. Indifference, no desire at all. I hope that some day they obtain this same freedom that I know they want.     I come from a family of smokers. My father quit a 35 year - 3 pack a day addiction (unfiltered camels) a long time ago but my mother and 3 siblings smoked until recently. Unfortunately, my 2 sons took up the addiction too. My husband quit many many years ago. Sadly, 1 brother is now being treated for throat cancer and my 83 year old mother was recently diagnosed with lung cancer. They each have quit, but my 3 other siblings continue to smoke. Its very difficult not to say anything to them, but I don't. They know what they're doing, they are making their own choices.        There is a silver lining to this awful news, as soon as my sons learned of these diagnoses, they each quit smoking. That makes me so happy!     Three years of freedom and it feels wonderful. I know everyone says this, but its so true - if *I* can do this, you can do this!
So glad that you were able to find the site again.  Thanks for posting your story so that others might learn, you have a strong message here.  Also almost 3 years quit, that is a strong one you have going.  And yes this site is so helpful in so many ways!!!!!
    Hi Hyacinth, congratulations on that great quit you have! I think you may be confusing the two boards. This site has always been quittrain  I'm really sorry about your mom and brother. My father and his brother both died from smoking related cancer, it's awful  But it's awesome that your sons have quit, that must be such a relief for you!I hope you stick around to offer your knowledge to others following behind as I remember how special I thought it was when a long time quitter took the time to support me  
    Congratulations on your quit, Hyacinth !    We will have bells on for your Third Year of Freedom in November.   S    
    Congratulations on your amazing quit, Hyacinth!
    Anyone else live in a house of smokers?     I get them for Mrs boosh and am often with her when she's smoking merrily away. It doesn't make the quit harder because I took the view that I will find myself in lots of smoky situations and it's simply not feasible to avoid them all, I'd be running forever. No, I want to laugh in the face of a ciggy box with no temptation to have one. I'm winning.  
    I have so much respect for you quitters who still have smokers in your house. It must be truly hard but not for you mightyboosh, well done  
    Mighty One,     YES ! You ARE winning.  Your quit is ALL about YOU and your nicotine addiction. Everybody else is secondary, every THING else is secondary. You Quit Smoking !  You are a FREE person.      Our friend, Joel, has a good video about living with smokersHow Can I Quit If I Live With A Smoker
    High Five .!!!!!..... respect my friend ....It's not easy in the early days ...
    One Thousand Pounds of Respect my friend!!!!!   You're absolutely correct, you can not avoid all of them smokers and sooner or later you are gonna have to deal with that!! I'm proud of you my friend!!! Keep up the Quit!!!
Definite respect mightyboosh -- must be trying on you but you are doing well.  And no when I quit I was the only smoker in the house (grandchildren were thrilled)!!!Edited October 1 by Martian5
    I guess it's all in your head but mine would have exploded if I lived with a smoker early on.  That's what makes you the Mighty Boosh!   
    Sort of..... My hubby smokes at work, he never smokes in the house or outside our home. I don't know how he does it, but he can go without fine,  evenings and weekends when at home, or if we are away for a week! so why cant he stop all the time ....grrrrrrrrrrr    
    I live with two smokers. I have never asked them to change their habits as I know if they had ever asked me I would have said no. 
    My in-laws live above us, and they both smoke. My mother-in-law and I were smoking buddies, so I had to avoid her like the plague when I first quit. The hardest thing for me has been seeing their packs of smokes laying around. (I used to smoke the same brand and would bum one from them occasionally.) I feel a tiny twinge every time I see an open pack on the table. It's getting easier to resist over time, though. And I absolutely refuse to buy for them. It would be way too tempting for me. But I don't give them crap about continuing to smoke. (I let my husband do that!) I know when I was smoking that if anyone gave me a hard time about it, it just made me want to smoke more. I keep hoping my in-laws will quit, but at this point I don't think it's ever gonna happen.
    We all know the health benefits.    We all know the financial benefits.     We all know the smelling good benefits. Food tastes better. Breath is fresher. Skin is more radiant.    We all love our freedom. Right?     Another element of freedom that can easily be overlooked: freedom to get a new job.     I have accepted a new job.  Not only do I get tested for illegal drugs- I get tested for nicotine.  The assays used will detect ANY nicotine from cigs, patches, gums, etc.   If prospective employees use NRT, it must be disclosed prior to testing & they will continue to be monitored for nic use.         I’m in healthcare so I’m not sure if this is a common practice elsewhere.       I’m thankful and proud I no longer smoke.  Now perhaps more than ever- except maybe at Disney-being a smoker at Disney is a real drag!!          
    Congratulations on your new job, Lusty one !    The benefits of quitting smoking and putting nicotine addiction to sleep continue to manifest.
    Congratulations on your new job Lust!
    Congratulations on your new job.  I am surprised they can test for nicotine and deny you a job because you smoke.  
    Congratulations on the new job lust. That's so surprising that they test for nicotine, sounds like something California would do
    Me too @Linda Thomas   Applying for and then starting  a new job is stressful enough.  I can’t imagine adding another layer on top.         I’m curious why they started testing for nic.   Smoke breaks? Insurance cost & usage? 
    Maybe all of that lust!
    From our friend, Joel,Smokers Need Not Apply
    Congratulations on the new job!     I remember when I was working as a teacher. Every time I snuck out for a smoke break, I felt guilty. I was always terrified one of my students would see me. I wanted to be a good role model for them in every way. But I was still a slave to my addiction.       Smoking affects everything, including our work lives.
    thank you brothers and sisters
    Congratulations, Juan !  You are doing great.
    Yaaaa.....look at you go Juan ....well done .....
Nice one Juan. Keep going, 1 day at a time
    Two weeks + One Day...Good job Juan.        You've got momentum now.
    Hell week and heck week done, don't let your guard down now Juan. WTF week is the next hurdle on your way to freedom  
    OK NOPE dont let my guard down
    Great job, Juan!
Great job! You are past the first 2 weeks. You should be incredibly proud of yourself! I'm proud of you!
    I focus on my freedom
Where is our @Juanrmartino2  ?
Im here 21 days Done
    Please make you read all the above posts ...they are green pinned....   And watch all Joel's video,s....    They are full of great information to help you along ...    Don't forget ...what you are achieving is life changing ....you can do it !!!!
Yes, and if you want even more inspiration consider putting a ticker in your signature. I loved watching all the time, money and cigs not smoked add up.    Also the 2019 quitters call themselves the Ash kickers, here's the logo if you want it for your signature as well
    Quitting smoking and dealing with Nicotine Addiction is not complicated.    You must educate yourself, which will strengthen your resolve and commitment  to Not One Puff Ever (minute by minute if needed).        The rewards will manifest quite quickly, your health, self-respect, self-confidence. Blood supply to your limbs etc. Extra dosh in your pocket.     Take the opportunity to save yourself from a slow, gruesome suicide and save your love ones from having to watch the possible horror show.                       
DAY 16..... This is not a Sos…. but having a hard time
You're doing great Juan. You're now in WTF week and it's called that for a reason. But just power through like you have the last 16 days, you CAN do it
    Juan, if you give into the crave you are right back where you started.  You are past hell week.  Now is the time you redirect those thoughts.  You can do this!
Juan 2 plus weeks without cigarette is a big achievement .      Cigarette causes a lot of dangerous diseases , so please try to stay away .     These hard times will pass      The best way not to smoke is not to smoke       It is important to stay fresh
    Hey bother Juan,    You don't smoke anymore, bebe.  Soon, the thoughts of nicotine will be gone gone gone, forever !    Stay focused on your fabulous Freedom, I know you know how. This nicotine crazy stuff won't last long, believe us.  Breathe deep beautiful breaths of beloved oxygen and reward yourself.   You quit smoking !  S
    Fight for your freedom Juan ...keep busy... Come and play some games ...do a jigsaw ...stay strong .....look how far you have come ..   Turn negatives thoughts in to positive ones ...your beating that monster ...
    Hard times are temporary.       The freedom gained is permanent.        Your focus is in the right place Juan.

Real. Hard. Time.    This?   This is nothing.    NOTHING.    EZPZ
    amen brother
    Focus on your freedom and fight through this, Juan.  The early struggles are worth the longtime reward of living a smoke-free life.
    i will fight
    Start dancing on the good foot, Juan.   Accentuate all the positives    because the negatives are temporary and not worth your precious time.    
    Your doing great Juan....onwards ...
    How you doing today Juan ??
So there is a push at the moment to make the Melbourne CBD smoke free and as of tomorrow morning the Bourke Street Mall goes smoke free.     https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/councillors-push-for-melbourne-cbd-smoking-ban/news-story/5a19306d333bc561a63b4b0edf3d6538        So in Australia if an area is designated non-smoking that includes vaping. Other states joke the Victoria has become over regulated and is the nanny state but I'm not sure it's so bad.
Australia leads the way ..I.remember my last trip ,maybe 11 years ago ..    Even outside smokers had to be a good distance...away from people eating .. On a Trip to Paris last year ...the folks eating outside ...me included were surrounded my smokers ..   If was awful...I was choking....
    Victoria is a lot like Cali. All our smoking laws also apply to vaping too. 
Posted 12 April 2014 - 09:56 PM It's no big deal to be an Old Pharte. Sure, it's nice to achieve that milestone and receive all the accolades, but it's not hard anymore to not smoke. By one year, you are far into your new life as a nonsmoker and you don't have to struggle to stay that way. By one year, the benefits of your quit have improved your life and your lifestyle. You are reminded every single day how great it is to be a nonsmoker. Your bank account is bigger and your health is better. And for many of us, there is a whole new way of life outside of just getting rid of the cigarettes. We have discovered new activities we love, we eat better, we have a new found confidence, we're proud of ourselves. What's so hard about all this? You know who are MY heroes? That person who has been lurking here and has finally made the choice to quit. And those who just got past that magic 72 hour mark, or hit their one month milestone. My heroes are the people who have blind faith and believe us when we tell them it will get better. It's those who get up every morning and log onto the QSMB to make the daily pledge because they know that's the only thing that will keep them from smoking that day. It's the person who is out the door to buy cigarettes but instead turns around and posts that SOS. Newbies, you are why this board is here. You are the ones that are the big deal here! So, cheers to all those brave souls who one day will join us on the lido deck. You're in the trenches now, but keep on climbing and if you need help reach out and we'll grab your hand. Because you are why we do what we do. Edited October 8, 2018 by jillar

    This is a beautiful and inspiring post. Thank you !
Imagine how surprised I was to see that my post from over 4 years ago lives on, even though the site that I credit my quit to sadly no longer does. Thanks jillar for reposting it, and although I do believe it was done with the best intentions, I must take exception to the editing done without my knowledge,. "My heroes" did not wake up every morning and log onto quittrain, they logged onto the QSMB (quit smoking message board), The fact that this site is no more does not diminish the importance it played for so many people over the course of so many years. QSMB is what somehow got me through endless nights when I thought I could not make it another minute without smoking. It connected me with with people from all over the world,  It was the home of crazy online fights the likes of which I had never seen, and deep friendships formed that will never be forgotten. It was my lifeline for months. It is what has gotten me to this point in my life where I don't ever think of smoking much less wish I could, where I can hardly imagine the life I lived as a smoker for 45 years. Loss teaches us we must accept change and move forward.

From a newbie on day 1 of her quit being welcomed, from my first SOS post and receiving those messages of guarding my quit, to the regular banter of CoS and the ever important NOPE pledge, I'm absolutely glad I found this forum for the sheer level of support I get.   Thank you for the post, and yes I love reading new quit stories, people sticking up for their quit because somewhere, something someone wrote clicked with them.        So glad to be a part of the QT family.
    Welcome Aboard Kathleen....x
    My post from last night sounds a little harsh and overreactive in the light of morning, so I'd like to just add a few words and then bow out. Firstly, my apologies to Jillar. I know that you meant no harm in reposting or in the slight edit you made. You were always one of the most supportive members at QSMB and I'm sure you are on this site as well. But, to further explain, there is a history between the two boards and it is not a happy one. Any founding member of Quittrain who remembers when it was started will also remember why. It was a very emotional and divisive time for those of us involved.  I, like several other long term members of QSMB, chose to remain there and  kind of "went down with the ship" . My sincere best wishes to all those just beginning this journey, and to those of you helping them along their way. In the end, all that matters is that you quit smoking. 
@kathleen0515, I hope you don't bow out. You have so much to offer and it would be a shame to let something that happened so long ago be your reason why. Quittrain has been so nice to all of us that came over from qsmb. They have welcomed us with open arms and with no animosity over anything that happened in the past.
    Bumping for our awesome newbies  I loved this post when I was a newbie and I hope you do too.   You're all doing great! 
    This nights that should be welcomed,  for me are a really tough thing.  I'm not chasing fires to put out    I'm not chasing some circuit that is not functioning    I not hammering or pounding or even watching one of my guys hammering or pounding   I am sucking on my hard candy, getting paperwork done early or going for a walk about   in any direction away from the smoking area.    Headaches have started, tension in the neck and some trembling. I turn off the lights in my office and lean back way BACK close my eyes and day dream about my Grandson and I out shooting up something Or my wife and I ????? ok my Grandson and I wrenching on something that needs fixing.   OK just kidding about the wife, we spend some super nice days at the beach, the water   has gotten so clear you can see the baby sharks swimming around your feet.  But then I have to open my eyes turn on the lights and start all over again.    Going to start bringing some Alieve to work with me for the headaches.  And awe yes I will be writing your eyes off.    DEEP BREATH OK I good now    
    You're doing great opah, you're almost done with hell week so just keep your eye on the prize, better breathing to go hunting with your grandson  
All better for now, had an oiler shoot its wad, no that's not it,  dumped its load? no that's not it either,  drained its tank all over the mezzanine floor and is now dripping down on the heads of some of our clerks.  A little excitement !   That's no Hair gel you got there !Edited October 2 by Opah
    Your doing great ..keep your eye on that prize ...Freedom !!!
    HI  Try upping your fluid intake it may help the headaches.
    Much better today, got some extra sleep before work, ate well and packed a good lunch.  Have some to dos to do if slow times present them self's. got my sights set.     
    Glad you have a game plan opah 
I was just looking at my 2019 Ashkickers logo, and I realized something--2019 is winding down! What the heck? Where did the year go?        This time last year I was deep in the smoking habit, still trying to hide it from my family, feeling an almost constant sense of urgency and desperation for that next smoke.. Now I'm almost 9 months smoke free, and cravings have dwindled down to only the very occasional nagging thought, easily pushed aside in favor of a smoke-free existence..        If you are early in your quit and struggling with the daily grind, don't despair! It gets better. Before you know it, you'll be wondering where the heck the time went, and you'll be so happy you kept your resolve in those early days.       Freedom is fantastic!
    Good to hear from you again abbynormal.  Glad to see you going strong.  Yes the time flies and things get better, soon you will be on the Lido Deck so spread your wings!!!
    Thank you, Martian! It's good to be back.Gonna try to spend a little more time here from now on!
    Beautiful, inspiring post, Abby !       I am so happy you built yourself a solid and sturdy quit.   The benefits will continue to manifest in your life as  self esteem and self confidence reign.  You can trust yourself and really enjoy this freedom you have worked so hard for.       Stay focused, don't expect but, don't be surprised if a trigger/crave pops in out of nowhere.   These would be the last dying embers of a once active addiction and have no power, no power at all. You own your power, now, just watch it grow.

I found a lighter in the pocket of a coat I hadn't worn since last winter. I was immediately triggered and had to battle some nagging thoughts for the next 24 hours. But they were just that--nagging thoughts. Not hardcore cravings. Much easier to resist. But still annoying as heck!
    Great post Abby, I'm really happy for you and the awesome quit you have 
    Thank you, Jill!!!!!

Protecting Your FOREVER Quit     Nearing my six year anniversary, I am examining how I protect my quit.This quit is as precious today as it was during it's infancy.  I know that.I continue my vigilance.  I am not in full battle Riot gear anymore but, I still NOPE, if only to myself, every morning.  In the evening I am grateful for the day, grateful for my quit.My commitment stands firm.This ritual of NOPE is a part of me now, it takes no extra thought but, I haven't forgotten what it means.Perhaps, hanging out on QTrain keeps my eyes open and helps me to absorb the facts of addiction in a deep and daily way.For this I am v. thankful. I will do everything to stay free.     So, to newbies....this isn't a struggle anymore, hasn't been a struggle since the v. early days.It is now a conscious reminder that nicotine addiction doesn't magically disappear OR stay asleep if provoked.Addiction must be acknowledged and our commitment, our fidelity to NOPE ~ Not One Puff Ever Never Forever WILL protect our quits...forever.   Here is a fresh off the press video from our friend, Joel Spitzer.He is the one who helped me (and many, many others)understand my nicotine addiction.  I am so appreciative of his continuing teachings.                   Video describes resource pages set up to help people who have already successfully stopped smoking to maintain their quits over the long-term.      Resource pages discussed in this video:     Resources/Videos Related To The Implications Of A Puff Once You Have Quit   Relapse Prevention  Can You Spare About An Hour And A Half To Help Save Your Life ?     Joel Spitzer's Daily Quit Smoking Lessons                               Edited September 25 by Sazerac

You may remember in my introductory post that I said I gave up for seven years in 1997 so, an addict is an addict is an addict until we're pushing up the daisies.  My late mother in law had quit for more than thirty years and detested the smell etc. of cigarettes. She never wanted one but once said that if she did have one, she'd be back on 60 a day immediately. She had never read up on addiction but she knew instinctively what it meant.
    Yeah - nicotine addiction is a bitch for sure but once you are able to put it to sleep, it's easy to maintain providing you just don't do anything stupid. I think part of the reason I stick around here is to remind myself of that initial struggle to get to a place of little effort by following the early days of other quitters. We try to pass on thoughts and ideas that resonated with us when we quit. Not sure if any of that helps much or not because in the end, it's what we choose to do or not do individually. I can't save your quit and you can't save mine. This is one thing in life where each individual alone is responsible for their own ultimate success. Smoking or quitting ..... each is a choice!

    Good stuff - thanks Sazerac
    I am stumped! I don't know how to reward myself for getting over cravings, getting thru certain situations, etc.    What are some of the things y'all do or used to do?     I just bought a new-to-me car yesterday so that's off the table. lol (pics SURELY to come once it's light outside)   
    Truth be told, I never did anything special for my self really. For me it was the pride in knowing I had put another notch in my quit belt that was most rewarding. I guess if you have a special interest or hobby, spend a little $$ in that direction for something that makes you happy. Or something as insignificant as having a special meal you wouldn't normally have, go to a movie you've wanted to see .... anything that brings you a little joy. A temporary, happy escape from your daily grind. 
I love the feeling of being proud of myself, it's something I have never felt before.   I just need to quit eating every time I don't smoke - it's adding up.   Last time I quit I gained 20 lbs in 3.5 weeks! That is/was outrageous.  I still have that weight.   I don't need anymore.  sigh.
    Rewards .....they can be anything ...from a magazine to a new hair do....   As long as you get that pat on the back feeling ...what you are achieving is kinda wonderful....    I can remember being in my early quit ...and some guy asked me for a light ...i can still the sense of pride j got saying ..I don't smoke ...I high five,d myself in the air ..
    There are some rewards listed by quitters in the comments of The Significance OF Rewards thread.    I will look for more reward threads for you.        I ate Satsumas as a reward. Often my reward and one that stimulated endorphins was a few concentrated breaths and looking at something of beauty.   (that light on that leaf or the color of the sky, the shape of that cloud etc.) Baths, with smellies if you like.   A perfect nap in clean crisp sheets.    Listening, concentrated listening with headphones, to a favorite piece of music.    Taking a walk in the moonlight or to look at the stars.     I kept the dosh for a pack a day in a big Mason jar and watched it grow...and quickly !          
Rewards Are Very Important  from our @Doreensfree
    and from our friend, Joel    
    I didn't splurge on anything huge, I did like reciprocity did and gave myself a pat on the back most the time but I would go get a beer at the local post to celebrate.

You can treat yourself to anything that may make you feel good as well as proud.  A small special treat with dinner (food or drink), a quick walk at sunset to reflect all that you have done for yourself during the quit.  A hot soak during the evening.  Special time with a special person (or pet or just yourself).  Anything that makes you feel fuzzy and warm on the inside and you can take a few minutes to relax -- just keep it simple!!!!        Save for the extravagant celebrations for the 1st month, the 3rd month, the 6th month and most definitely that 1 year mark -- or you can go all out on any celebration if you desire, any reward for quitting you deserve!!!!!
    Today I bought some baby's breath to put in my Halloween (yes, already! lol) vases. I normally wouldn't decorate because my bipolar makes me lazy and blah, but the past couple of days have put a pep in my step . . .     And I have been actually lighting my candles instead of hoarding them. Today I am burning Pumpkin Peanut Brittle.   I am most positive my nose appreciates nice smells more now.    So I suppose these are rewards for myself, it sure feels like it anyway! Plus, when I reached in my wallet to pay for the baby's breath, there was extra $$ in there from not buying smokes! 
Those vases were actually at my wedding in October 2014 in Sevierville, TN. Sorry, couldn't help myself! Y'all know I love to post a pic, lol

    You are going through Epic Times, mrsG. Be Kind to yourself.    You quit smoking !
    One of my favorite rewards is a new Kindle book. I'm on a tight budget, so I try not to spend too much on extras, but I never feel guilty for splurging on new reading material. It keeps my brain and hands busy, and it is a great escape from the stress of everyday life.
    thank you brothers and sisters.
    Keep up the great work, Juan.  You are doing awesome.
    Yay Juan !!! You quit smoking !
    Juan ...I'm so proud of you ..your hours away from a fortnight smoke free ...!!!!
    it has been very very dificult
    Yes, the first month always is but look at all those cigarettes you've avoided! Well done  
    Congratulations, Juan.  You never have to go through this again !   and it will get easier, trust us.   Stay focused, you don't smoke anymore, Juan.    Focus on your freedom.  S
    i focus on my freedom
    Great work Juan. You are really doing this. Don't let anything slow you down

Deep in the archives, I found another gem from, our friend, Cristóbal       Cristóbal's Quit Days %         Some people are amazed that even though they may have several weeks or months quit,     that they still do not feel completely "normal", and continue to miss smoking.      When this happens, figure your "Quit Days %" and then you will see why.     The way to calculate this is:           Number of Years Smoked x 365 = Smoke Days.  Number of Days Not Smoked = Quit Days.          Then, Quit Days ÷ Smoke Days = "Quit Days %".       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     I will go first, to be the first example.       I smoked for about 30 years.        30 years x 365 = 10,950 Smoke Days.         As of today, I have not smoked for 5 years, 2 months, 7 days.   This period of times = 1904 Quit Days.          Then, 1904 Quit Days ÷ 10,950 Smoke Days = 17.388%. This is my "Quit Days %".           In other words, even at more than 5 years since my last cigarette,  as of today I have been quit for only 17.388% of the total time I smoked.       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         Now, let us take as the second example,     a smoker who smoked for 30 years, and has been quit for just 4 months.  These 4 months might seem like a very long time to the ex-smoker,   but it is nothing when compared to 30 years.        This smoker who smoked for 30 years, has 30 years x 365 = 10,950 Smoke Days.        Quit time of 4 months = 120 Quit Days.      120 Quit Days ÷ 10,950 Smoke Days = Quit Days % of just 1.096%, of the total time the smoker smoked.            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Smoking had a deep impact on us physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.     A lot of the physical damage can be repaired in a time period of about 10 years,    but some of it can never be repaired - the damage is done !!!       The mental, emotional, and spiritual damage can be repaired much quicker,   since all of us at one time were never smokers. None of us started life with a cigarette in the mouth !!!   We all know how to live life as non-smokers, we just need to remember how to do it again.   And time is what is needed for that to happen.      It is my experience working with others,    that how quickly one becomes very comfortable in these 3 areas  depends on the person and also their understanding of nicotine addiction.   The more a person understands the process of separation from the active addiction,  it seems to me the quicker the good comfort levels of being a non-smoker return.        What is important to understand,    is that the first year as a non-smoker will be spent confronting triggers,  many of them that are seasonal.     Once you arrive at your first year anniversary,     most people can say that they are making very good progress adjusting to life as a non-smoker.          Cristóbal               Edited December 31, 2017 by Cristóbal    1
I still can't believe how long I smoked: 35 years as best as I can reckon since I had some unsuccessful but long quits. Started smoking at age 14.5 and quit at age 52, so 52-14.5=37.5 ...  I've been quit for 984 days which is 2.7 years, rounded. So 2.7/35 is about 8%.        Yeah. It seems like an eternity... I can't believe I let that addiction rule most of my adult life.
Good quit on the mark 2.7 years.        I started at 13 but i didnt think i really 'properly' smoked till i was about 15. But im going to take from age 13 as i was smoking and the damage began from then. So thats 20 years smoking, crikey thats disgusting. So quit 139 days which is approx 0.4 of a year. So 0.4/20 = im at 2%.   Must admit i feel very comfortable and do not miss smoking. Long may it continue.
    That is an interesting way to look at it, and something that I hadn't ever considered before. Food for thought. Thanks Sazerak (thanks Cristobal).
You should also count the years before you started smoking as non-smoking years, not just the quit years.  To give you a more accurate percentage of not-smoking years.     Going by those numbers, I have 32% non-smoking and 68% smoking      If you just go by years smoked and just quit I have 5%, there would never be a chance to break even.Edited March 24, 2018 by Wayne045
I like that way of thinking wayne, as its now saying 67% and i sure feel 67% better not 2%. I may have done the math wrong but oh wow that feels much better thanks.

Ive had a few drinks lol is my math wrong   13.4/20 is 67 im confused

If counting time before I started to smoke i have 20 years smoke free and 15 years smoking.  If NOT counting time before i started smoking I have 2 years quit 15 years smoking 13.33%

OH I likey.... but I prefer Christobal's formula of not including the days before your smoked.... for the simple reason you were not an addict now... so those years don't count because you didn't have nicotine receptors...... Its a quit percentage, not a not smoking percentage... so the period of time before you started smoking... there was nothing to quit...       So... doing the maths (and deducting the ears in between when I didn't smoke with my first quit and pregnancy/feeding)... I have a quit percentage of 5.39% ... srill a ways to go but I will reverse that figure.

This is your Quit Days %.       Always remember to compare: how long you have quit ÷ how long you smoked.       You will need to have a quit for 20 years, for your "Quit Days %" = 100%.           Cristóbal

How many cigs have you not smoked since you quit?   My ticker says 653 at the moment.   I will add up all the replies after a couple of days. It will be illuminating I'm sure.
ALL of them.    The Sarge has NOT SMOKED every last cigarette manufactured, world wide,  since he quit.     Each and every one.     Everywhere.     ALL of them.    EZPZEdited September 25 by sgt.barney

    Not sure what my ticker says until I post lol - gosh I am nerdy! Sorry Mightyboosh!     But whatever that count is, I am very proud of it  you should be too! 
    My ticker's broken and hasn't worked for months now when I did have it. I'll make another one later to see what my count is. I  m sure it's a few!
@mrsguest   145 for you.        I think I'll do a running total instead.        44,598 so far.

I'm no math-a-magician, but I can do a bit of figuring.  At 3 years, 6 months, and 15 days quit and considering that I smoked a minimum of 25 cigarettes per day that gives me a number of 32,375 cigarettes not smoked.        However, that's not the whole story.  I was still a drinker when I quit.  When I was drinking, I mean really drinking, it wasn't unusual for me to smoke more than two packs in a day.  So, adjusting my number for alcohol induced inflation brings my total estimated current count to...38,255

Never used the ticker but I would estimate around 14,500 over the last 3 years. Thank God I finally quit. For me, it`s hard to believe now that I waited so long to finally do it.

FILLING THE PAGES by Eric   A common topic a quitter might talk about since they quit smoking, is the fact that there seems to be void in their life now. Now that they're not smoking it feels as if the days have grown longer and they are unsure of how to fill this time. Sometimes this can actually put stress the new quitter, because this is so unfamiliar to them.   Cigarettes have been so deeply intertwined in their life for so long, that the new quitter is constantly being reminded that they no longer smoke just from everyday activities.    They may ask how do they unwind after work now that they don't smoke? How do they deal with stress, now that they don't smoke? How do they punctuate finishing a task now that they don't smoke?    For the smoker, that cigarette after finishing a task was like putting the period at the end of sentence. Now that they don't smoke, daily tasks can just feel like a long running sentence with no punctuation.    The cigarette was also like the smoker's pause button. If they needed to concentrate on doing something or were under a stressful situation. They would step back, smoke a cigarette and think about how to resolve the problem. Now that they don't smoke, there doesn't seem to be a pause button for the quitter. That magic button that says" Whoa give me a minute" is now gone. Now they are just left with the situation and a very unfamiliar way that they now have to deal with it without the cigarette. One thing that should be pointed out though, is that we have lived our lives and dealt with stress DESPITE smoking, NOT because of it.  There was a fellow quitter that was talking about this and it was really stressing her out. She was having a hard time dealing with stress and everyday scenarios without smoking. She was getting discouraged about this and felt that her life just felt kind of empty since she quit. She felt that there was now a void in her life.    One thing she said though, that I thought was an interesting way to look at it, was that she said that since she quit smoking, was that she felt she now had to rewrite her life.   When I read this, for some reason it reminded me of someone writing a screenplay about the day in the life of a smoker. This is what it might say.  -----------------------------------------------------------------   THE DAY IN THE LIFE OF A SMOKER.    Dear (anonymous)    I'm just making this up, but let's just say this is how your typical day when you smoked would look like.   You wake up. Smoke a cigarette. You get ready for work. Smoke a cigarette. You have breakfast. Smoke a cigarette. You get in your car and drive to work. Smoke a cigarette. You get to work. Smoke a cigarette before going inside. You go to coffee break at work. Smoke a cigarette. You go to lunch. Smoke a cigarette. You go to second break. Smoke a cigarette. Maybe something stressful happens at work. Sneak out and smoke a cigarette. After work, as you drive home, you smoke a cigarette. You get home and unwind. Smoke a cigarette. You cook dinner. Smoke a cigarette. After eating dinner. Smoke a cigarette. Have a glass of wine or beer and of course smoke a cigarette. Watch TV. Smoke a cigarette. Get ready for bed. Smoke a cigarette. Before going to bed. Smoke a cigarette.    Let's say that it took 5 pages to write the screenplay "In the daily life of (anonymous)."  Now that you don't smoke, you're not so much rewriting your daily life, but more of editing out a lot of useless dialog in your screenplay that isn't needed to tell the story. The problem is that now after all that editing, what use to take 5 pages to tell the story, now only takes 3 pages. Now you still have 2 blank pages that you're carrying around with you and you don't know what to do with them. This can cause anxiety. You have been so used to writing your daily life with 5 pages that writing it with only having to use 3 pages feels like there is a void in the story.   Really take a look at the dialog that you edited though and put that down on the 2 remaining pages. Here's what it would say: Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. etc, etc.   You can see how useless this dialog is. It doesn't even help tell your story and on it's own it makes no sense. It's just repeated blabber. You have two choices now. You can either take these pages and just throw them away, because you no longer need them anymore. Or you can take these two remaining pages and add something to your story. Something that maybe you've wanted to add for sometime now, but just have never done it, because this addiction was taking up those two pages. These two pages are no longer being wasted on telling the story of your addiction. They are now yours to tell any story that you wish to tell.   It isn't so much that since you quit smoking, that there is a void in your life. It is more that smoking created that void, because it took away from you. That was YOUR time being wasted, it was NOT being filled. Now that you have freed yourself from cigarettes, don't think of it as leaving a hole in your life. Think of it as giving back the endless possibilities of living life as YOU again.  Also don't think that you need a cigarette to deal with life's stress.  It isn't that you were able to deal with stress better when you smoked. It's just that you've done it for so long that way, that you are having to relearn how to do it without cigarettes. It's new and unfamiliar. Smoking under stress was a combination of relieving withdrawal, but it also gave you a minute or two to reflect on what was causing the initial stress.    If you're under stress and where the times you would smoke a cigarette, what I would do is stop. Step back and give yourself a moment just like you would do when you smoked, but now breathe deeply, calm yourself and focus on what you need to do to alleviate what is causing the stress.   Don't feel that if you're under stress that you have to attack it head on because cigarettes are no longer there to buffer what it happening. You can very easily do this without smoking. You can step back and give yourself a moment to collect yourself and you can do it without cigarettes. They are a useless middleman and you know that cigarettes don't relieve stress. They only relieve withdrawal. They don't deserve that kind of credit. You should be proud of yourself, because you have taken your pages back.    The pages are yours now. Fill them any way you choose   Eric
    When I was about to quit, I thought, "So what to do instead of smoke during brief pauses? Like times you would stop and do nothing else except smoke a cig.     It does take some getting used to, trying to get through those pauses without a cigarette.  It never was as bad as I had imagined. I guess anticipation is usually worse (or better) than the actual event. One gets used to it pretty quick though. I know these days when it comes time that I would stop specifically for a cigarette, I do not often even think of smoking.
    For newbies 
    Another great read. Before I quit I did have thoughts of what will I do now. That was me...everything revolved around that cigarette. Now I am relearning how to do things without one and it is difficult at times but I am slowly learning how to fill those last two pages. Thanks for the bump n
Yes - this is what takes the longest time is learning how to live life as nonsmokers. It's only when we quit that we realize just how much of our time was consumed be smoking activities! It's quite shocking actually.Edited March 21 by reciprocity

Now that they don't smoke, daily tasks can just feel like a long running sentence with no punctuation.                That's a great way to phrase it and true.
    Here is more information about 'doing nothing'   
    and this about taking breaks            Video explains how most smokers productivity and level of personal comfort are negatively impacted  by the chronic need to having to smoke to alleviate the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.        Smoking breaks      It is amazing what the logic of a smoker is in regarding these little breaks.   It starts with a smoker popping into drug withdrawal, breaking his or her train of thought or physical stride,  and then saying or thinking to himself or herself, "Oh, I think I need a break, I better go get a cigarette."       What you will soon realize after quitting is that you will all of a sudden start projects   and then follow them through to completion without taking these breaks. You will generally get them done significantly faster and more accurately for you won't have those constant breaks distracting you from the projects.   Soon you will realize the truth of what smoking was doing to you time wise all those years.     It was never that you were needing a break and thus going for cigarettes.   It was that you were NEEDING cigarettes and then having to take breaks. The week you quit your efficiency may suffer, but you will make up for that lost time in a matter of days,  and soon you will find yourself a more efficient person for the rest of your life.  To keep this newfound efficiency, as well as all of the other benefits of no longer being controlled by cigarettes  is as simple as always remembering now to never take another puff!  Joel
    It's Stoptober soon here in the UK. Is there a similar thing elsewhere in the World?    Anyhoo, it will be the first time that I don't have to avoid and hang my head in shame at the public info ads on the TV. I've allowed myself to feel a little smug about it, just a little.  
Here in the states we have the Great American smokeout. This year it's November 21. And yes, I felt the same as you did on that day......
    Go ahead and feel as smug as you like. You've earned it!
    I always would say I was going to quit for the Great American Smoke Out.    Well, that day always came and went.
I don't think there's any special stop smoking day or month here in Canada. At least not that I'm aware of. Mind you, my wife tells me all the time that I don't pay attention to things, or something like that?Edited September 26 by reciprocity
This can't be a complete list, I am sure.  There's a good chance you weren't aware of at least one of the diseases.  I would have never connected blindness to smoking.   
Blimey.
You can add feet to ths list....I was at risk of losing mine.....
You can add feet to ths list....I was at risk of losing mine.....I remember Doreen, was it your circulation causing your problem?  
It was the blood was not flowing properly....My ankles had thick black bruises.....they were sore ...After a few weeks of quiting ,I felt the difference......I still have some deep bruises,but getting better all the time.....
I am 6 years down the line from Cervical Cancer, I now get tested every year, my results came through last week "All Clear", my friends mum has problems with her feet and has been told if she doesn't stop smoking she will lose her legs, can't believe I still smoked for that 6 years afterwards!!  The Nicotine Addict can tightly hold you in its grip, so relieve I am now finally free,
Good post Colleen.  So many things are related to smoking.Just to add more: sleep disorders, cataracts, sense of smell and taste buds to name a few.  And if you have inherited medical conditions like diabetes and smoke it causes many more significant complications. It was the blood was not flowing properly....My ankles had thick black bruises.....they were sore ...After a few weeks of quiting ,I felt the difference......I still have some deep bruises,but getting better all the time..... I am so happy that your feet are improving Doreen.
Love this post Colleen!  It's is important for us to remember where we came from.   I had several of those conditions and they have either improved significantly or are gone all together.
macular degeneration is linked to smokers smoking causes more that just lung cancer. I am glad you posted this because when people think smoking they think breathing/lung they dont realize the other ways it harms your body. 
Oy vey. 
Colleen, awesome post!  It never hurts to be reminded what smoking can cause... you never know who is reading this that will finally choose to become a non-smoker because something clicked in their head. I have very minor COPD (no drugs, no inhalers), I'm lucky that I quit smoking when I did... I wasn't even diagnosed with it until 2 years after I'd quit, even though I figured I had it because of the shortness of breath if I did a lot of stuff. Jackie, it's wonderful that you are now 6 years free, I'm really happy to read this! :)
Almost 2 years clear of cervical cancer here too, thankfully I was checked every 6 months after loads of weird cells over the years, sliced and diced in the end. Weird though, no one ever linked it to smoking, then I checked (after I quit) and they are linked, strange no doc ever told me they were? Don't think it would have made a difference (!!) but still....
I love this post, and images often make a bigger impact on me. Ive saved that pic on my phone :)
My grandfather died of pancreatic cancer 15 years ago, he was a heavy smoker.  Before then, I had associated smoking with lung cancer or smoker's cough.  Around the same time my mom, was found to have an aortic aneurysm, a heavy smoker herself.  My grandmother was diagnosed with COPD a few years ago, even though she hadn't smoked for many years.  I was diagnosed with COPD at 37, it is no longer an elderly person's disease.  I am willing to bet that there are a lot more diseases and conditions out there caused by smoking.

Bump ..
It's unreal how it just affects everything. My Mom passed away from cervical cancer just over 8 years ago. She was young - in her 50's. She smoked right up until the end. It was just heartbreaking. Yet, it didn't stop any of the rest of the family, myself included, from smoking. It's just so awful to think about all the damage and destruction cigarettes do, in so many ways.
I'm bumping this because tomorrow we find out if my mom's feet can be saved. She's smoked all 55 years of my life. I'm not sure when she started because she gets mad if you ask her anything about her smoking.    In June my sister noticed my mom's toes were scabby and pus filled. My sis took her to a walk in clinic who directed her to the hospital. After x rays and a night in the hospital it was determined she had an infection in them and sent home with antibiotics.   They didn't work. Now after an MRI it's been determined that her circulation is so bad in her legs that if this last ditch procedure they're going to try doesn't work gangrene will set in and she will lose her legs within a couple of months.   She will not even think about quitting smoking but for those of you who are still on the fence, now is a great day to quit.....
    Geez Jillar - that's terrible! I am praying that there is some way you mom's feet/legs can be saved. I can't even imagine your frustration over the fact that your mother still won't quit.         Stark reminder that the devastating effects of years of smoking can have on one's body. Pleeeeeze QUIT! Even worse is the reminder of just how powerful a hold nicotine addiction has over us. Put your addiction to sleep people - QUIT!
    Wow, @jillar what gruesome news and a reality check.    There is nothing good about tobacco and nicotine addiction. Nothing.        I hope your Mom listens to somebody and stops.  I am so relieved that you built a sturdy quit, Jillar.      This is frightening and so damn sad.
I post this in hope it will help somebody lurking here with vascular problems   and also to make sure we all understand the vicious implications of nicotine addiction.         here is the text        “I’m mad that I can’t smoke anymore! It is so unfair.”  This statement was angrily expressed by a clinic participant while introducing himself to the group at the third session of his smoking clinic. He had been totally off smoking for two full days, and was absolutely disgusted about it.   I asked him why he was giving up cigarettes if he was so miserable about the prospect of quitting.      His reply was quite incredible. In front of more than 20 people he said,    “I have peripheral vascular disease. I have had gangrene on one foot three times and already have lost a couple of toes.    I am going to lose that leg in the near future. To tell you the truth, I hope they take it off soon. It hurts so much all of the time.  I hope they just take it off and give me an artificial limb that won’t hurt anymore.    My other leg is also affected, as well as both of my arms.  Do you know why I have to quit? My family begged and pleaded for me to stop when I was first diagnosed, but they finally gave up.   They now say, ‘Keep on smoking, Dad, but be forewarned–once you lose your arms, we are not going to buy or light your cigarettes for you.   You can lie and cheat now, but you won’t have a chance of sneaking then.’       I couldn’t believe they were telling me that. I immediately enrolled in the clinic. It is so unfair, but what choice do I have? I hate that I have to quit.”        “Do you realize what you are saying?”, I replied. You are mad that you can’t smoke. But what is it that really is making you mad? The fact that you are going to lose a leg from smoking?       No, you have accepted that quite well. In fact, you are looking forward to getting rid of the one quickly because it hurts so much. You are not even upset about losing the other leg, even though it would mean you would probably never walk again.   Are you mad that you will lose your arms? No, that is okay with you, too.   Sure, with no legs or arms you would be totally dependent on others, a complete cripple.    But that still is not the basis of your anger.  What are you mad about?     You are mad at how unfair your children are because they are not going to let you smoke once you lose limbs.”   Without hesitation he replied, “Yeah, how could they do that to me?”        Some of the clinic participants looked on in disbelief at the exchange that just occurred.  Some of them thought he was crazy.  Others exhibited a sense of shame, for, even though their own conditions may not have been so graphic,  they recognized his attitude in their own thinking and they were not very proud of that realization.        Two days later, the participant with peripheral vascular disease    who had been so traumatized by the thought of quitting smoking was expressing great relief in being free from cigarettes.       Once he beat the initial grip of addiction, he recognized just how irrational he was and the true destructive nature of his cigarettes. He was already feeling some physical improvements in circulation,   and, in fact, had starting forming a thin layer of skin underneath a scab that he thought would never improve.      He was still exhibiting anxiety about not smoking, but now from a totally different perspective.        He feared smoking and prayed that he would never again get caught in the grip of nicotine dependence.   A dependence that he now recognized once controlled his thoughts and behavior   to the point of his being willing to give up his limbs, independence, physical abilities, and even his dignity.     He was completely justified in maintaining these fears. If given the opportunity, cigarettes would once again regain such control.  But now, all he needed to do to insure that cigarettes would never again exert such a grip was to NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!                   Edited September 26 by Sazerac

My feet were saved ..but I still have some battle scars left ...to remind me ...never take another puff..   I'm sending positive thoughts to your mum ...and the strength to quit ...
    I can't believe this is what the cig ads were like.                            
    They were brutal ads for sure, in  terms of what we now know. At the time though, the truth was just beginning to be discovered.    Have you watched these yet mighty? If not be sure you do. Pretty unbelievable stuff          
    When I watched these documenteries...it was as if  I switched on the light bulb...  I got it !!!.....what I kept blinkered all my smoking years ...erupted before my eyes.. If was a turning point for me ...   Please if any newbies has not watched these ..they are a must ...    
Yesterday I was browsing around on amazon video and stumbled across a nostalgia video made up entirely of old time commercials from the 50s, 60s, and I believe the early 70s.  There were several smoking ads included.  I got to admit that the animated marching Lucky Strikes was entertaining.   There were quite a few for Newport’s (which must have been new at the time, I even vaguely remember seeing those as a child)      if if you want to see brazen, hard sell ads for cigarettes look no further than those old American TV commercials
    I don't remember ciggie ads on the telly but I do remember billboards and magazine ads. The one day cricket series used to be called the Benson and hedges but it got renamed and racing cars used to be sponsored by tobacco companies but not down here since I was a kid.
I googled this and didn't realise it was so recent that it was allowed on F1 cars. Just think of how much lobbying and kicking and screaming the tobacco companies did as they saw their ads being banned all over the place. I remember the snooker World Championships being sponsored by Benson and Hedges and the players lighting up during broadcasts.        "The advertising of cigarettes on Formula 1 cars has been banned since 2008. The 2008 Bahrain Grand Prix was the last time the Marlboro logo was seen on a Ferrari F1 car."
A lot of those old cigarette ads are mind-blowing.  I have seen numerous variations of ads where doctors were endorsing Camels.  Unbelievable by today's standards.     I started smoking around 1993 and 1994 and wasn't exposed to cigarette ads on television.  I was pretty sickened to recently see an old cigarette ad featuring The Flintstones, a cartoon I used to love when I was a kid.  Really sickening.
    Not content simply selling poison to children, the folks at Marlboro decided it was a good idea to use babies to sell poison to adults.

Talk about advertising your cigarette brand to kids - WOW!! So Johnny. Did you end up smoking Winston's?                    Just curious if this stuff had an effect on you personally?

G’day       This is one of the adds when I first started smoking.   Recognise the bloke in the add? It’s Paul Hogen ....a long time before crocodile Dundee he was the face for Winfield cigerettes. Hard to believe they were 40c a pack. This was the world I lived in in the mid seventies, hard to imagine these days.  Chris

I tried quitting with the patch December 27 last year. It worked great! No issues at all.   This year, I got a new script, same exact patch - and I am having a hard time keeping it sticking to my skin!   It's also itching/scratching me a lot.  Has anyone ever experienced this? Any tips? I switch up the location of my patch each time I change it, etc. I don't know what else to try.

Being nicotine free is excellent and only takes a few days. The rest is adjusting yourself to your new life.    That is the exciting part.      But, if you want patches, I am sure somebody will be along to help with your concerns.      All quits are good quits !  and congratulations on yours, mrsguest.
    I think I would talk to the pharmacist.  Maybe they are a bad batch.  I did try them years ago but ended up quitting cold turkey.
    The strangest thing just happened!  I took off my patch and threw it away to give cold turkey a whirl, and my dog got super excited, he started jumping around and acting weird, licking my face - just out of the blue!    Maybe it's a sign?

    I had issues getting a "store-brand" patch to stick; no rash though. I gave them away and went cold turkey after the second day of my quit. It wasn't easy but it certainly was doable and I'm happy it went that way because then I didn't have to deal with getting the nicotine out of my system later on. It was all done at the beginning. 
    Why not stick a regular plaster on ...sometimes it mind of matter ...   Going cold turkey ...is the quickest way to quit ...    Don't over think things ...you can do it ..
    That was definitely a sign mrsguest      The next week or so may be a bit of a struggle while your body is ridding itself of nicotine but you can do it. Give a shout out if you need us, we'll be here  
    I feel GREAT since I threw that patch away!     I know it might be a temporary high but it feels so good right now 
    Your a beautiful non smoker ...you should be happy and proud ..
    Yes - focus on the positives. That's a huge help in those early days. Not only are you seeing some benefits already but there are so many yet to come and the best part is they stay for good! Those ticker stats also keep adding up too!

Sunshine - I have been thinking about the gum, but I took this patch off like 4 hours ago and I seriously feel zero difference.     I am wondering if the patch wasn't even working on me because it wasn't sticking correctly or something.

Mrsguest, the sooner we get the nicotine out of our bodies the sooner we can go through and be done with the misery. You're doing great
Each person needs to do what they are comfortable with in terms of how they quit but here' a fact about nicotine in your bloodstream. It takes 3 days, 72 hours, to rid nicotine from your body no matter how many cigs you smoked per day. That's the relatively easy part of quitting. It's reshaping your daily life so you can function comfortably without cigs that takes a long time and a steadfast commitment over that time. Whatever you do, once you suspect nicotine is out of your body DO NOT reintroduce it under any circumstances. That's a step backwards!

It would explain the mood swings and awful cravings I would get.
    I used the patch. Just be careful as if it was working you still have nicotine in your system which might be why you haven't noticed anything yet. Not trying to pee on your parade. 
    I totally understand, thank you Lilly! I have an extra in my purse in case I start freaking out.

PLEASE, stop it !   All quits are good quits but for you to be promoting gum    when people are ready to go Cold Turkey     is just WRONG WRONG WRONG.  STOP IT.        Cold turkey does NOT take a special environment.    Quite the contrary, it is simply about CHOICE.  You have everything you need to go CTurkey. It is all about natural YOU and choice.

Bitchy as hell in those early days. Not very nice to be around and cravings that seemed to have no perceivable start or end to them. Hey, I got through it by sheer will power at times in those early days. I WAS NOT giving up no matter what. And you know what ..... it worked  Time seemed to stand still in the first couple of weeks or so but eventually started moving again (thank god)    It does sound like maybe you weren't getting a nicotine feed off those patches so maybe just stay the course without any other quit aid. You can come here to rant and rave when you need to. We get it
    The longer you go without nicotine, the better you will feel.   Sure, you may have some gruesome moments, some bitchy moments but, pfffttt...   the discomfort is replaced with some euphoria and a renewed trust and confidence in yourself.

Guys, if you need yet another reason to quit, here is a big one: cigarettes are erection killers.  Smoking is a major contributing factor in both high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.  Throw in the fact that nicotine is a vasoconstrictor and we are talking severely diminished blood flow.  Cigarettes also diminish the amount of nitric oxide in the body.  Summation: if you value the ability to attain and maintain an erection...STOP SMOKING! Put some hope in your rope, just say NOPE.
It is beneficial for Women, too.Blood circulation ! essential for arousal in Lady Parts. :)
    While women are not as gifted as Hyenas,    the benefits of quitting smoking are abundant.

    I hate to admit this but sometimes i would smoke WHILE having sex or "alone". Kind of a brave thing when smoking RYO because if you ever tried one, you know the cherry isn't always real stable.   But yeah I once had this partner and we would adjust our positions so we could safely smoke while in "action". Maybe have to stop oral action to take a puff off the nicotine stick, but never during orgasm.       To this day I have NO clue how i gave up smoking and stayed quit. Crapola hell I was hooked.

    Good to hear Juan !!

    I'm talking about e cigs. I love the look of and like to handle anything that's well engineered especially small, heavy and chunky items. E cigs fit that criteria perfectly and I'm sure I'm not alone in appreciating nicely made objects. Even the boxes they come in are a cut above a run-of-the-mill box. They've also become very tactile and the colours can be very attractive. In all honesty, they're a nice piece of kit but that's part of the problem now. Apart from delivering nicotine, they're a very attractive fashion item.    Cigarette manufacturers have always tried to make their product appealing but they just had a box to work on whereas e cig design has endless possibilities. That must be stacking up to be a big problem as technology advances irrevocably. The liquids also smell good enough to drink - cookies and cream, pear drops, McDonald's apple pie etc etc. you name it, they have it. Even the dedicated e cig shops look trendy, upmarket and inviting.  Now that the dangers of vaping are being realised, I wonder if the e cig makers will at some point be forced to make their product drab with graphic warning images on them, as cigarette makers were latterly obliged to do with their packaging.  At the moment the whole package just looks too good.
    Don't fall for it Phil, it's garbage and is causing a lot of illnesses from using them! The Trump administration is moving to ban flavors just for that reason
I don't see the allure of them myself but I get your point. Younger peeps want something slick, substantial and easy to use and carry. Something that when they put it to their lips, it's very different from a cigarette. You may be right on future regulations surrounding e-cigs. I'm imagining an e-cig. in the shape of a skull & cross bones perhaps or at least a label with such attached to the packaging     And what about taxation on not only vape devices but the juice pods or whatever they're called? Cigarettes are heavily taxed in most countries. As far as I know, there is no such "health tax" on e-cigs or the juice pods they sell. I heard and advert today on local radio for a "starter kit" at $12.95. Includes a vape pen & juice pod. And, oh yeah .... when will the public advertising stop as well. I haven't heard an ad for cigarettes since I can remember!

    As we all know ...the cigarette packets looked good too....all that lovely gold wrapping ...with all those lovely tokens inside ...and the beautiful gold lighters you could buy ...

Stoptober   What is Stoptober?  Stoptober is a 28 day long event run each October during which participants are encouraged to stop smoking. Public Health England created the annual campaign and continues to fund it. The idea is that participants pledge themselves to not smoke during the 28 day period, with a mind to giving up altogether. Over 250000 smokers took part last year and even more are expected to sign up for 2015 and beyond.  When Did Stoptober Start    The first Stoptober campaign launched in 2012 and was an outstanding success with the power of social media very much being involved in the popularity for the event. There has been a massive amount of buzz for the Stoptober events with celebs joining in and the nation standing together to encourage each other to quit smoking and enjoy the benefits of doing so.  Why Does it Work?   The idea behind the event is based on evidence that shows that after twenty eight days without a cigarette smokers are as much as five times more likely to give up smoking for good.   It is widely recognised that giving up tobacco smoking is an extremely difficult task for some however with the wealth of support available through the scheme itself, friends, family, the NHS and other participants, as well as resources, an app, social media channels and more it is clear to see why Stoptober is successful.    Benefits    Smoking tobacco cigarettes is harmful to your health and the health around you, not to mention the environment and your bank balance. None of these are facts that are disputed however many do still find themselves smoking regardless as they haven't been motivated enough or felt that they had the right level of will-power to quit. Stoptober offers a wealth of support to help you achieve your goal of giving up your tobacco habit and enjoy the many health, wellbeing and financial benefits of quitting smoking. How to Get Involved Getting involved couldn't be easier, simply sign up and await your free information and support pack to arrive (Stoptober packs will be dispatched nearer the time although you may get help giving up smoking throughout the year).        Are you wanting to quit  ?????  What a perfect time to ditch the cancer sticks for good ... Jump on the train for motivation and support , to get you free ...  We have arranged for another carriage ..so plenty of room ...   Looking forward to meeting you ..
    thanks brothers
    The Sisters are here for you too, Juan      Congratulations on EIGHT days of Freedom.   I am so proud of you.  Stay vigilant and reward yourself for every crave/trigger conquered. You are doing great.
    Congratulations Juan on getting past the hardest week of them all. Hopefully now you feel confident enough to fill out your quit date and maybe even get a ticker.   
    Great work Juan ...onwards !!!
Congrats Juan   Remember all the headaches cigarettes will cause    It is a good reason to stay away from cigarettes .      Deal with the rest of the headaches that life gives you .    Edited September 22 by Sunshine59
    thank you brothers and sisters lol
    Keep up the great work, Juan!
    You have a lot of people cheering you on Juan! Keep building that quit  
    Good work Juan.  You've put "hell week" behind you.     Stay relentless and keep moving forward.
    Congratulations! 
My ticker says 30 days at the moment and that reminded me that I quit a few years ago for 30 days. It was a weird quit in that I said to myself at the time that I WOULD start again if I did a month! This was to prove to myself that I could quit whenever I wanted to. This is the smoker's odd reasoning which we're all aware of, truly ridiculous thinking. It didn't work of course, I was back where I started, in the grip of a monster again.    That's the warning. I read on here that Nicodemon does this to some people, a sort of complacency thing and a con trick to make us think we're in control. We're only in control if we NOPE with 100% conviction and don't test ourselves with such nonsense.   The demon is very wily, full of tricks so watch out!
    Great post M... We are addicts ...no such thing as  !!! Just one  !!!!.....

    Great reminder Phil, thank you 
    I'd like to know the site consensus as to what constitutes a quit. Is it giving up setting fire to tobacco or is it a total absence of nicotine however it's delivered.      
    Although I quit cold turkey, I find nothing wrong with using NRT's to keep you from setting fire to tobacco. There's no one way fits all method in stopping imo so if it's with help from NRT's I'm all for it.     The benefit for me in quitting cold turkey was that I didn't have to kick nicotine withdrawal down the road which is what happens with most NRT's.
    I would say that once you put that last cigarette out for good, you can say that you have quit.     The ultimate goal is to be completely nicotine free but if a NRT can help you get to that point, that is great.     I quit cold turkey but it took me a number of attempts.  If a NRT helps you out in the beginning, that is cool...as long as you work towards becoming completely nicotine free in the end.
In my, not so, humble opinion,  the minute you stop delivering Nicotine to your system is what constitutes a quit.      I understand there are many paths to the center but, the real issue here is nicotine addiction. Nicotine Addiction is all that matters in the conversation.     Sure, if NRT's get you to the place where you no longer deliver an addictive substance to your body then, I am all for it.  The point is dealing with Nicotine Addiction.   The rest is inconsequential.        I have seen over the years here,    addictions to NRT's, flagrant abuse of NRT's    and  also initially 'earnest' quitters that will not deal with Nicotine Addiction.  I cannot help them.     My focus is helping people that understand or are willing to understand Nicotine Addiction.     It is all about the NOPE.        Edited September 20 by Sazerac
    I'm not as hard line on this as Sazerac, although I understand her stance and respect it.   In my mind there's the nicotine addiction issue and to get past that clearly you have to stop putting nicotine into your body but, weening completely off nicotine can wait for those who feel they can not quit cold turkey (I was a cold turkey quitter, by the way).     The biggest hurdle to me in quitting is your day to day life habitual smoking routine. Whether you smoke cigs or vape, it's the "garb a smoke" reaction to so many daily life events that is the hardest thing to get past and takes the longest period of time to reconstruct your life. I get the fact that some may want to soften the early quit challenges by continuing to feed nicotine via a properly controlled NRT program. It has clearly worked for some, as has prescription medication such as Zyban and whatever else that's called. I do believe that stopping the flow of nicotine ASAP is also a requirement but just not at the very start of one's quit. What concerns me more than the patch programs are these gums, sprays and lozenges. Those items seems like candy to me. Therefore, more difficult for people to control the dosage plus the temptation to combine any number of NRT's without appropriate medical consultation. Too many want to believe there's a magic bullet out there somewhere that will eliminate the hard work aspect of quitting and that's just not the case.      No question, there are potential issues with NRT's but they have done a lot of quitters a service and continue to do so if used appropriately.       
I'm an NRT quitter coming up on 2 years smoke free and I think I used NRT for 9-12 weeks. I used gum but it was only ever going to be a short term thing, the NRT.  Previously I had a long term quit I threw away that was cold turkey. The thing is I can tell you the time, the date, the day if the week I had my last smoke but I am not sure when my last NRT gum was....I know it was after I joined here...I know it was after another member commented that they were NRT free and I went...oh, I should do that.      Now here's my spin.... Cold turkey is best BUT everyone is different and it's not the best for me ....so for me, right from the get go I was like "I'm a junky, my drug of choice is nicotine...I am addicted, but I am also addicted to the ritual and routine of my smoking, and I am addicted to the psychological aspect (which is the lies you nicotine addiction tells you to get a hit)...knowing myself I knew the first thing I had to deal with was the habit/routine and the psychological...the physical bit would be easy...retraining my self to function as a non smoker not so easy. So I went into the NRT gum thing as... The box says I should be having 1-2 4mg per ever hour...so I'd have 1 and see how long I could go between them...I'm a bit competitive, even with myself...so if I didn't have my first nrt gum until 9:30am then that was my new start time...no NRT before then....i wasn't clock watching for my next hit, I was clock watching to beat my last pb. I would alternate a normal Chewie for an NRT so even now if I feel a bit like I need a smoke and I chew any old NOT NRT gum the crave goes. After the first week I was on the 2mg gums and my whole quit I bought 1 pack of 30 and one pack of 250 and I still had more than half left when I stopped using them.        NRT is fine if you need it...it does prolong the whole crave phase but the two golden rules any NRT user needs to have....go in admitting you are an addict and go in with an exit plan.        Honestly I needed NRT and if I could go back I wouldn't change how I quit.Edited September 21 by notsmokinjo
My opinion ...  I have tried to quit hundreds of times ...if not thousands ...some quits .lasting 30 minutes ...    I've used every thing possible ...every NRT.... hypnosis.... acupuncture....you name it I've done it .. The only way thing that has worked for me is cold turkey and Allen Carr.....    Having said that...I say get yourself to Rome( Freedom)....any way you can ...as long as you stick to the recommended dose ...and use NRT properly ..then go for it ...it's better than dying from Emphysema... What I have discovered..You have to want to quit ..otherwise nothing will work ,it has to be a 100/0 commitment...
I don't know if anyone is into it or even heard of it - but diamond painting is taking tiny stones and sticking them to a canvas to make a picture out of the thousands of tiny stones, it keeps your hands SUPER busy!     I love doing it to keep me distracted from smoking, just a suggestion if you're into that sort of thing     Just Google it if you'd like more info or I would be happy to point you toward my favorite site!    I've done at least 5 and that's before I even quit smoking! I never smoked while doing them.
What a great idea to keep your hands and mind busy. Love it, we want to see pics of your work please Edited September 21 by jillar

    It is like bedazzling but smaller!  I will post some pics tomorrow. They're in the room & hubby is asleep I don't want to wake him

    Welcome to Quit Train Mrsguest! That is a great idea to help distract you from the urge to smoke. Keeping your mind distracted and your hands busy is important! Use every tool in the box when quitting

Hi everyone. I was quit for over 2 years and relapsed 6 months ago :( but I’ve since been quit again for two weeks today but my symptoms are bad. I never got over my chronic SOB which makes me so mad at myself for starting again. I have horrible anxiety and depression, my legs ache badly, I’m tired and can’t seem to shake it. I have no cravings, I just want this all to go away  any suggestions?
Glad to have you aboard Sos77 and sad about your relapse.  However, you do have 2 weeks into this quit and that is a very good thing.  As to your symptoms you have to fight those and understand they will pass.  What you can do in the meantime is go thru the various educational materials on this site.  I had many of the same problems what helped me most was sleep when I was tired and I drank plenty of cold fluids ( water and also various juices which will help with your blood sugar.  You can use Jillars's Air Cigarette ( a piece of drinking straw cut down to cigarette size), it helps fool the mind and does a pretty decent job.  Walking or some form of exercise helps also.  If you feel some of these symptoms are not manageable you can speak to your doctor but they do pass in time, the first 3-4 weeks can be tough in this way but it is doable.  Again there are many resources on this site that can help.  Others will be along also to give advice!!!
    Welcome SOS, sorry about the relapse. As you may remember that first month is the hardest. Hang in there and I agree with martian to see your Dr if any symptoms are to troublesome, they can maybe put you on a temporary med for your anxiety if it's really bad. I was extremely tired for months but it does get better. Our chemicals in our bodies get all messed up for a while but usually level out in time.   Congratulations on two weeks quit 
    Hello and welcome ...   Sorry you smoked ,when you had a brilliant quit ....    Read all you can here...    Watch all the video,s ....  Stay close .... Well done for taking your seat in the train ..   
Welcome to QuitTrain, SOS.      I'm sorry to hear about your relapse.  2 weeks is a great start back, though.  Smoking really brings nothing positive at all to your life, just negative.  You will be so much better off putting that behind you for good.     Stick close to this site.  Read as much as you can and reach out whenever you need help.  Education and support is what helped me quit for good and you can get both here.
Welcome Sos77. Sorry to hear about your relapse but keep that lesson learned top of mind once you secure this new quit      You should probably speak to a Dr. about the anxiety/depression issue. Are you on any meds for this before your quit? They might need to be altered. Same thing with the aching legs. Unless it's because you have been tensing up those leg muscles since you quit, you mat want to seek a medical opinion on that too. The tiredness is a pretty common early quit issue. Have you had your blood-sugar levels checked since quitting? Sometimes those can dip a bit when you first quit. Drinking fruit juice or sucking on a few hard candies might help. Listen to you body. There a lot of changes going on when you first quit. If you're tired, sleep more etc. Those things won't last all that long.      Make yourself familiar with this site and read all you can. There's some "pinned" threads on the main Quit Smoking Discussion page and some also on the Introductions page. We have a daily NOPE page too where some pledge their Not One Puff Ever each day to set themselves up for that smoke free day - one day at a time.  There's a Joel Spitzer video page as well which covers all topics related to nicotine addiction and quitting - very useful stuff.       Lots to keep you busy and knowledge IS power so .... go fill yer boots with knowledge about nicotine addiction

My suggestion is to stop smoking,   deal with your nicotine addiction   and learn how to love yourself.     In that order.  We are here with all the support you need, well....online anyway.       Quit smoking, the rest will follow.     Love,   Sazerac
When you choose to quit smoking,    I recommend taking a look at these resources.    Will This Get Better    When You May Really Need    Resources Regarding Mental Health Issues       In my Not So Humble Opinion,    the most important thing about quitting smoking is coming to terms with the addiction.  Once I coped to being an addict, the rest was logical.      Addiction doesn't go away.  It has changed our DNA. This is why NOPE and NTAP  are essential in the maintenance of a successful quit.       Do not doubt yourself, you are capable of maintaining a quit, you deserve a free life, don't you ?                   Edited September 14 by Sazeracfixed links
    Welcome SOS.  I am glad you have decided to quit again. I do get discouraged when I see a quitter that has relapsed.  I look at quitting as a gift of life.     I hope you truly find success this time and look forward to a smoke free life and never look back.  I have depression and anxiety and found it was heightened during my quit.  I discussed it with my physician and she upped my prescription.  I can tell you my anxiety is much better since I quit.  Hang tough and beat those craves.  You can do this again.    
Hey @Sos77! Sorry to hear you relapsed but the main thing is you've quit again! So congratulations on that. I found a lot of help in reading about addictions and how they work, psychologically especially, I had already quit until I started reading about it, properly. I found it really did something great to my brain, I was already ready to quit but it gave me an extra insight into what I was dealing with. Reading about addictions just reinforced that I will never smoke again under any circumstances. There's a lot of material on this site so hope you'll find it helpful. Edited September 14 by greenlight
     

    How are you doing S?    We're thinking of you.
    Hi Sazerac... the depression part has seemed to take hold and I’m trying to stay positive. I’ve started on the medication and although I don’t want to depend on it, I need the help right now. Still no cravings! I never want to have one again. Never. I just want to get back to my self without the sadness. Thank you for checking on me. You have been such a huge support to me. 
    Thanks everyone who responded with all this overwhelming encouragement. I re-read your messages often and it gives me strength to get through this storm. I’m committing to NOPE. Never again. 
People who have stayed away from cigarettes for this long will surely know how to fight it .    I think its mostly the beginner quitters who struggle the most .        I am doing alright after 6 days of no smoking . That is because this is my 7th attempt after many gaps and relapses .       Its not even that hard especially when you know the health related issues and headaches  it causes

We understand the challenges of quitting and to have depression/anxiety in the mix is not a cake walk into town.    Quitting itself can bring on the blues, have a look at  "Quitting Smoking Blues".       Your body is going through quantum changes, S.  Please treat yourself very kindly.  Reward yourself for everything !  This will jump start some endorphins for you. NOPE your way through, breathe intently and purposefully.  Oxygen is the perfect drug.  You are doing GREAT !  You quit smoking !  It will get easier and easier you must believe us.       S
You should be very proud of yourself for powering through and not giving in no matter what is thrown at you.  It's almost 3 weeks now, so some of the toughest days should be behind you.  Just keep moving forward and gain strength from each successful day.   And when things are tough (or not) you can always come here and yell at us, share a laugh, find an empathetic ear, or just distract yourself for a moment or two.
Still loving  my badges! Well I made it though the first 30 days! There have been some cravings. But all in all not to bad. I have the habit I think the most at this point. But I’m finding I like not having cigarettes running the show! I don’t have to worry did I remember my cigarettes and lighter, when am I going to get to a smoking area etc. I feel free when this happens now! And the times I think about smoking are becoming less and less. And thanks again to everyone who has supported me in my quest to become a non smoker! This forum has been  invaluable to me and my success! I may not always post but I’m here everyday reading.
1 month -- great job.  You are seeing many of the benefits now and the great thing is that you will see many more benefits.  Keep strong and celebrate this fist month of being smoke free!!!!!

Coming here and reading everyone’s stories,  pledging nope every day which I know makes me accountable. Lord knows I need it. And let’s face it,  if you never smoked you just don’t understand. 
Hi everyone sorry I’ve been missing in action. Though the storm didn’t hit south Florida it did a real number on our friends and neighbors in The Bahamas. I have been quite busy helping with the  relief efforts to Grand Bahama. It’s only 60 miles from me. We spend a lot of time their in the summer. Please everyone pray for them and the lost souls. There are going to be thousands that  parish in the storm. I’m still keeping my quit. No smoking even with all the stress of a hurricane. God bless you all. I will be back on when things slow down a little so many things to do at the moment.
Good for you on 2 fronts ..... keeping your quit while stressful life issues happened and for helping out to those poor people on Grand Bahama Island!  We will look forward to hearing more from you when you have more time. Godspeed in the relief efforts you are involved with and yes, we are praying for all those injured and lost to this horrible event.
Good to hear from you Diane, glad your house is safe but I'm sorry about your friends in the Bahamas. That's awesome that you can keep your quit and be there for them. Proof again, that if you want your quit bad enough you will succeed, xoxoEdited September 10 by jillar
    Glad to hear your quit is strong, Diane, and that you were safe during the hurricane.  I feel for all impacted by the storm and I pray for your friends and family impacted by this.        I look forward to hearing more from you when things get settled.  Great job on keeping the quit.
    Congrats Diane 
How are you doing @Sos77?
@reciprocity hi. Thanks for the check in. I’m in a deeper depression today. I called in to work. I’ve already contacted my doctor and started on antidepressants a couple of days ago so I’m hoping that will help. I just want to feel myself again. Hope all is well. Thanks again. 
Sorry to hear that @Sos77, hopefully your Dr will get you feeling better. These first few months can be really hard for those who suffer from depression and anxiety but those people do find that their depression and anxiety actually get better the longer you stay quit. Hopefully you'll find that too.
    Thank you @jillar  waiting for that day!
@reciprocity  commented on taste buds being re-born in another thread of mine so I thought I would start a dedicated one on the subject.        I bought a packet of dried cous cous, rice, lentil etc. concoction from Aldi and have just tried it. Now this just wasn't me, previously, to eat this sort of stuff but I must admit it was very tasty.     I'll always love the bacon and egg side of cuisine but I'm exploring different stuff especially things that will help control weight gain after my quit. It's opening up a new area of interest due to flavours being allowed to express themselves now.    I'm not an extremist about anything in life so I will treat myself to naughty things on occasion but I think I've enough willpower left over to have healthy eating as part of my quit package. Any thoughts, suggestions?
I know of two people, one here, who after quitting discovered hummus.   Easy to make and homemade = easy,better.    You might enjoy Good olive oil,  a fresh herb, a tomato and an excellent loaf of bread.         Go explore your taste buds !        I am so glad you quit.Edited September 16 by Sazerac
    Great stuff Mighty!! I can't give you much in the way of any suggestions of what to try. I haven't made the switch to even trying healthy eating yet. Maybe one day?

The girlfriend and I have switched to a vegan diet and -while it takes a lot of planning to eat properly- we're creating dishes and experiencing things we wouldn't otherwise. I've always had a super sniffer/taster anyway (even when I smoked) and it's even better now, so we're really enjoying our meals, rather than just eating the same old crap (literally).      Our change to vegan is mainly for health reason. I'm no meat nazi by any means. It's just what works for us. I feel better now than I have in years!         Edited September 16 by JimHannoonen
    My husband loves tabouli.   I just picked the florets off of a huge batch of parsley.  It only took me an hour and a half.  He hates the store bought kind because of all the stems.  It is such a light refreshing salad.  I used to think it was not worth the work until my granddaughter fell in love with it also.  Now Grandma loves making it!   My husband is Lebanese.  Many of the Mediterranean dishes are very healthy. 
I love hummuse .    I have been hit by a bit of high blood sugar and i changed my diet 3 days ago . No non-veg diet .       nowadays i am mostly eating wheat , fibrous food and vegetables .

Marmite is way inferior to Vegemite, it tastes different and gross....only 4-6month old babies and foreigners should ever spread it thin....in our house we eat it from the jar!        Have you not heard of an Aussie Burger? Both Macca's and Hungry Jack's (burger king) have versions on their menus down here...      ^issues with the above...pineapple should be grilled too....onion should be fried...piss orf the bbq sauce and use tomato sauce (ketchups much nicer Aussie cousin).

Hello QTrain, What helped you through  your First Week without Nicotine?   For me, it was:   Watching The Clock and seeing 'craves'  lasting a shorter and shorter time.                     Breathing purposefully. Satsumas. Water Saving the daily money for a pack of smokes.  I kept it aside and watched it pile up. Sticks of Cinnamon. Jumping Jacks or Dancing Wildly. House Cleaning. Determination and Desire for Freedom. I 'discovered' Joel Spitzer's  videos. http://www.quittrain.com/topic/2096-joel-spitzers-quit-smoking-video-library/   I had a suspicious (show me) attitude but, was quickly chastened and ultimately enlightened.It was during my First Nicotine Free Week, watching Joel,that I started to educate myself about Addiction.Denial was no longer my modus operandi.I started to face reality.
I just posted this elsewhere, actually seeing smokers really helped my quit like this:When you have to, really watch them smoke. Mentally note how there's a "catch" in their throat and then a cough. Remember, they are inhaling poisons and chemicals (70 of them proven as cancer causing!) with that cig. Also note they do not look blissfully relaxed, they are not smoking cause they are lovin it - they are smoking because they are a nicotine addict and after 20 minutes from putting out the last cigarette, the craves are beginning and get bigger until you remedy it with yet another fix of nicotine, complete with chemicals and poisons.  Ice cold waterA list of all the reasons I didn't want to smokeclicking my fingersPosting all over the boardNOPE shuffle - switched from foot to foot shouting loud or in my head NopeA mantra - "For milly and I"Hard boiled cough sweets (I just like them lol)DancingNobbys chilli peanuts! SOOOOO good, averaged 3 packs a day and then had to wean off them hahaCleaning, specifically mopping was my big crave fixer.Crystals, dalmation jasper necklace and a tumblestone that I would touch if I craved. I needed a lot of distraction :)  So worth it though for what I have today. One other thing, I found I couldn't talk on the phone...every call I would spark up, I just stayed away from the phone like others avoided alcohol. Most triggers I decided to face head on, which worked for me. x
Eating everything and anything, mints, sleeping/really early to bed, singing, treats at the end of each day, It's mad but I can hardly remember,  I wish I had done a journal!!
Sleep... Lots and lots if sleep!  (OK I was sick, but because I was asleep 90% of the time I didn't have much time to crave)... After about a week I downloaded an app which told me how my health would improve, how much money I was saving etc...  Sorry this is much help to most, but starting a quit when you are sick can really work!
Wow I feel great to be able to contribute in this post LOL  :D Water, water, water...in amazing amountsNapsPosting here, reading posts, all about the boardReading and watching youtube videos about nicotine addictionDrawingDeep breathing, baths and relaxations techniquesThe ticker that tells me how well I´m doing One on one conversations
Reading the literature and watching the joel videos.
 :)
    Staying close to the board every chance I got....reading everything I could.....and then some....   Listening to what was being said to me....believing it....  Allen Carr....easy way.....it made me see the addiction,what what it is.....    My punching pillow ..my I pod ..    I have never considered my self as a drug addict...he made me reolize I was.... Serious health issues.....my fate was much more scarier than quitting....
 :)
Accountability

    Another good read for new riders!!      The first week chocolate and positive self talk.    Also, I read everything I could about my addiction and found out WHY things were happening.

In your first week, especially if you quit cold turkey, eat small meals so that your blood sugar levels do not go low.          When you were a smoker, every time you smoked a cigarette the nicotine caused your liver to release sugar into your blood.      When you stop smoking, your body has to learn how to adjust your blood sugar levels by itself, without nicotine. It takes some time for this to happen.     Because of this, low blood sugar in your first few weeks of your quit can become a physical and mental trigger and create craves.       Avoid these triggers by eating these small meals.           If you do have a strong crave, it is very useful to eat something very sweet immediately like cookies or candy. After 5-10 minutes, your blood sugar levels will go up, and this higher blood sugar level plus just the passing of some time, will help your greatly to manage your crave.      This advice is also very, very useful when a member posts a SOS message on this forum. That is always my first recommendation.              Cristóbal                    Edited October 31, 2018 by Cristóbal

    Setting a stopwatch when the craving started. It'd usually pass and I'd forget I'd set the stopwatch.   Eating something, sometimes healthy, sometimes sweets.  Posting an SOS or a pre-SOS and writing out my analysis of what I was experiencing and thinking about.  Took my dog for a walk. Started a blog and used that for a private SOS--i.e., not something other QTers would necessarily respond to.   When craving was (is) at it's worst, it was usually at the end of the day. I'd go to bed early to fight the impulse to end the quit.    More than half of the time, I was able to be online at QT during a craving. Without this connection, I would have given up and started smoking again.   Thank you, all.
Icewater. Yelling in pillow. Allowing myself to go through the crave, feel it and then after few minutes push myself to detach from it. Writing and reading everything, in hopes vital information was stored. I think it was  Walking walking walking. Around the house, during lunchbreaks, powerwalks as well as long, tiring km's. For a period of one month I put myself on tomato/cucumber/egg/nuts snacks. To prevent myself from treading one addiction for another. It worked.      Vital for me was (and still is!!) 1. examination of my junkie thinking and 2. finding out what's underneath: something in me is crying for attention. What is it and can I provide it? If not, how do I handle this without smoking <- because that should be your ultimate goal here.  Oh and one of the angels here kept reminding me about forcing myself to look for beauty. Even if the whole world felt like there wouldnt be any beauty, like EVER, and everything was a big pile of stinky messy sadness. Thanks for that.
    Wait. This topic is about the first week. I just described my first months.     Slept all the way through first week. Don't remember much

The first week I quit was all due to my having a stroke and being in hospital (I was yelling for the NRT patch!!) awaiting a carotid artery stenting procedure...slept when I could, played solitaire when I couldn't, drank water and did a lot of deep breathing! I didn't have any online support at all until about 3 months after I first quit....

    bump for @Christine and other newbies.  Congratulations on your quit !!!
I've shared mine on this forum before but for those who haven't seen it I quit on an impulse in the middle of the day in June 2012. Something just flipped in my head that day, I hadn't decided I'd quit or thought about it but I was increasingly annoyed at it. I went to the shop, walked out of there, lit up a cigarette as usual and realised it was the last of the pack and I'd have to go buy some more. At this point something just went in my head, I decided there and then I actually hate this and I'm never doing this again. This was 7+ years ago and I've never touched a cigarette again. I remember being really p*ssed off at the cigarettes, but even more so at myself for smoking again/still.       My method of quitting is sudden and extreme, it may not fit everyone. Keen to hear how everyone else has quit. I think the method is irrelevant, people differ on this. It's the fact you quit and stay quit that matters. Edited September 2 by greenlight
I knew I needed to quit so I prepared by quitting smoking in the spots I normally smoked so that when I did quit I wouldn't associate those places with smoking. Mainly my garage. Then on Memorial day weekend 2016 I just decided not to buy anymore cigarettes. I didn't tell anyone until about day three when I told my husband.   Him being a never smoker helped by going with me if I had to go out because I didn't trust myself not to buy cigarettes.Edited September 1 by jillar

    Cold Turkey on a whim.  The whim quickly turned into a personal challenge to myself.    I thought, 'I'll try this for a year and see what the year brings'      Educating myself about nicotine addiction was the seminal component to my quit. After a few days, I knew I was never going to smoke again.   
        Just now, Sazerac said:             Educating myself about nicotine addiction was the seminal component to my quit.                                 This, this, this! I also quit on a whim and then spent significant time educating myself about addictions. I realised I'm never going to be free from it, I Ill always be an addict. Hence I will never smoke again. 
I had made multiple attempts to quit before and once again failed during the summer of 2014.        I was upset over that and I was going to turn 39 that October.  It occurred to me that 40 was right around the corner.  I had said that I was going to quit when....I graduated college, I turned 25, I turned 30, etc....and here I was still a smoker in my late 30's and I knew I had to quit soon.  If I hadn't already done irreversible damage to my body, it wasn't going to be long.  (I already had a horrible smokers cough, was always tired, depressed, etc.)       Instead of jumping into another quit attempt, I decided to educate myself by looking for resources on the internet.  I stumbled across QSMB (another quit site that no longer exists but many of us are from there), joined, and the support and knowledge I got there helped me quit and stay quit for good.       I think support and knowledge is what helped a lot of us which is why many long term quitters are still here.       So, I quit cold turkey with the help of online support and knowledge (not to mention Allen Carr's book which I would recommend to anyone trying to quit).

I've always thought you seemed familiar from that time.        I actually second Allen Carr's book even though I didn't quit based on that now. I did once quit based on reading his book for nearly a year though (until I got cocky and thought I am no longer addicted)
    I've just put a post up on my Facebook if anyone would like my Allen Carr book, if none of my friends need it I'm sure I'll find someone  
Mentally, I quit on a Sat. about 10:30 AM when I was loading groceries into my car on a cold, damp January day. I was coughing hard and what did I do .... I pulled my cigarette pack out of my coat and lit one up. That initiated another bout of harsh coughing. Probably not the first time that had happened but for some reason, it clicked in my brain ; "You gotta quit this bullsh*t"! Next morning I had my last smoke on waking up at about 8:30 AM. I was convinced I would fail so did not tell anyone I had quit. I kept the mostly full pack of cigs I had - just in case! I have no idea how I made it through those early days. It was pretty overwhelming so I basically just became a nico-zombie! Not knowing what to do or what to think but I did know I just couldn't smoke even one or my battle would be for nothing and it was too disruptive to my entire being to have to ever go back to the place I was on that Saturday. There were a few pinnacles in those first few months where I had to really focus on what I wanted my future life to look like. I guess it was maybe 6 or 7 months in when through whatever circumstance I was in then, I just suddenly knew .... I would never smoke again. Since then, It's been pretty smooth sailing. I still think about smoking at times even though I can't imagine myself as a smoker yet I have enough respect for myself and for the fact I am a nicotine addict for life to ever consider lighting up another smoke for any reason what-so-ever! I know I have to live the rest of my life by the same principal I have done for the past couple of years - NOPE! And, that doesn't bother me in the least

    My daughter was visiting from Australia..I told her about this pain in my ankles and they looked bruised..  Of course I was forced to the doctor's .... Basically told Quit smoking ..like ...now ....or face the consequences......possibly amputation ... There's nothing like pure Fear .to bring on a sticky quit ...   We got home ....my daughter begged me to quit with tears rolling down her cheeks ...    I've never had a cigarette since that morning   I made a promise ...and i kept it ...   Kept my feet too ...    I found a forum ,met the most wonderful lady ,who took me under her wing .... read Allen Card too...    And a promise ...            
Randomly tossed the rest of the pack out the window on the commute home from work ( go ahead - arrest Sarge ... he littered ... ) and haven't looked back since.    Unplanned. Unforseen randomness.    Sarge admits to thinking about it for months prior (due to a bad Doc Visit (High blood pressure, high cholesterol, pre-diabetic - ( all the metabolic and health/lifestyle bullshit we're free to change but rarely do)), but it just sorta ... happened ... completely at random one otherwise un-noteworthy day on the ride home from work.   It's been 8 years.  It'll be a lifetime to go ...   EZPZ
I had known for sometime that I had needed to quit.  Then a long talk with my doctor and then another long talk with her nurse over the phone (all based on test's and symptoms) that I had really needed to quit.  I thought long and hard and realized that the doctor and nurse were being really concerned not just preaching from the normal medical standpoint that smoking is bad for you but really concerned about my health and well being.  I told the nurse I would  think about it and discuss on my appointment in the next couple of weeks.  Well about a week from that appointment I woke up in the morning had a cigarette and saw I only had a couple left --- instead of going to the store I though about the doctor/nurse talks and did not go to the store -- have not smoked since.  Needless to say when the doctor asked a week later about what I needed to quit I told her that I was a week into my quit (ever since that day my doctor and I have  had  a much better relationship and is always on the look out for  medical problems more so now).  That was also the day I found this sight and stuck to it to educate myself on all things to do with quitting and feel that it was a true life saver.  Anyway kind of long statement but it is what it is and I am proud to say  I am a non-smoker -- something I thought I would never be able to say!!!!!Edited September 3 by Martian5
    I think it's the same way for all of us Martian! Different circumstances perhaps but always the same pride of accomplishing something we never thought we could or would. Great feeling eh?
I had my last cig on 2/10/17 while standing outside a friend's truck waiting for him to open door for me....we had just left Urgent Care office and I was told I was in the throes of a stroke, my friend was taking me to hospital. I smoked it halfway and then flung the butt into a snowbank and said "that's it, no more smoking for me!"      Since then I found out that damage had been done to my arteries - the following year I had a triple bypass open heart surgery. I thank god that I quit when I did!!
I quit cold turkey in August 2012. I was standing outside, coughing after every drag because I had yet another cold. I asked myself, "Is this really worth it?" I just started a new job and was in training for 3 weeks, so I decided to focus on that instead of smoking. It certainly wasn't easy, but it has been so rewarding.

My quit is only a couple of weeks old so some will remember my introductory post but here is a reminder.    I've suffered from poor circulation in my right leg for a few years knowing full well that it was due to smoking. However, my latest test showed a move from 80% efficiently down to 70%. The particular nurse who did the test didn't beat about the bush and said I could eventually lose my leg if I didn't quit. Other medics have told me of the dangers before but she had a manner and piercing gaze that finally made me see sense. I wasn't too keen on her at the time because she was quite brusque and not like the previous ones but I must thank her though as I really needed that kind of approach. A big kick up the ass it was and much appreciated.
    Hey Mighty ...i nearly lost my two feet ...due to the same ...  So glad we both found it here and get to keep our limbs ....we have alot in common .....    Way to .go ...!!!!!

I'm not complacent though and never will be because of my first quit in 1997.  There is a walk I do sometimes as part of my work and that is getting easier now. My leg still hurts because it's early days still but I did it today and didn't stop. The last time I did it, I had to stop four times.    I also took my BP at work and it was 116 over 69. I am on pills for it but before I quit, it was still too high even with the medication.   I'm wondering if I will be able to come off them as I improve in fitness. That would be something to tell about on here.

I smoked for a 5 years and searched for a way to stop smoking.  i recommend the video guide i made to stop smoking. type in youtube"a healthy way to stop smoking"  or here the link        Its a short guide around 8 min and if you follow it  for a month it would be easier for you to stop smoking entirely . getting over your psychologies habits and  substitute physical   smoke craving is important to succeed stopping smoking. Even if you broke up and smoked a cigaret?! don't stop trying give up smoking. The longer you don't stop smoke, the easier it becomes  after a month or two you already feel difference.

We are here to help you succeed in quitting.  We all have been smokers.  Stay close to the forum as you start your journey to quit and take the NOPE pledge (NOT ONE PUFF EVER) every day.  I found that really helped solidify my quit.  There are many games to help keep you mind busy while you learn to fight those craves.

    Welcome @Travis Trapani, glad to have another quitter on board our train  I found that having a group of people really helped in knowing I wasn't alone in my battle to conquer this addiction. No one knows better what we go through than us Drink lots of water or juice, have sweets on hand, I craved soft peppermint puffs for the whole first year of my quit so you may find you have a craving for sweets. Listen to your body. It knows what it needs to get you to freedom

    I was looking at my ticker with some pride at how many I haven't smoked as well as the cash saved. It got me wondering about how big the totals of all the members on here would be.    It would be a boost to everyone and would give a huge group feel to the wonderful thing we have done together.  Is there a way of doing this without having to count each one?
Posted 17 December 2013 - 07:44 PM  When my son was young he would walk to the end of the drive to wait for the school bus. I would stand at the bay window off the side nook of our home where I could look down the drive and watch until he safely got on board.  Sounding like a good father this may be. But in actuality I found I enjoyed the heat off the glass and watching the life outdoors from the birds to the ever changing leaves of the seasons. Here I would smoke my morning cigarette. It wasn’t long I had moved a small bench near the window so I could sit and be a bit more comfortable And take in a bit more of my surroundings. I bought a nice brass ashtry on a stand to place next to my bench and would bring in my newspaper into the nook ., By the following year I came to realize  It wasn’t much of a bench or that comfortable, So I decided to have some work done to the room and to the window I had a much better built in bench placed into the wall almost making me like a cat sitting on a lagre comfy ledge over looking the world , searching for his pray, like that fat robin I watch in the mornings searching out a nice fat worm.     On day while peering down the drive , watching , waiting for my son to board the bus, I noticed a shadowy figure standing off to his side. I would not say it a ghost or man, just an odd shadowy figure,, quite perplex this left me , almost to the point of quizzy, what was this figure ,, what was it doing out there ?        For the next few mornings to weeks perhaps months I would watch with an unsettling intent ,, always wondering , what was this figure,  a shadow from a limb or tree ?   In the afternoons if I were to walk to the end of the drive never was there any evidence of such a figure, questioning my son , was always the same “ your crazy” he would  Say. But No I was not crazy ,, I saw what I saw and what I saw was a real as you and me.        As the years past , I began to come to terms with the  figure at the end of the drive , I knew well whatever it was meant my son no harm. But still each day I found myself looking out the window.. Years would pass , no longer did my son need a protective eye to watch him get on to the bus. But still each morning I went to the window for my morning coffee , cigarette and newspaper. Always peering down the drive slowly it was becoming obvious the figure had turned its sights to me,, no longer was I the watcher , but now the watchy. And with this the hair on the back of my neck stood up,     Schools years would come and go, Jason would be moving in the fall to attend collage  and I found my self remolding more and more I had moved my study down into nook , moved a side wall expanding the nook itself allowing me more room, I worked from home and really found with these accommodations I was just fine, plus saving me time from going up and down the stairs so much.     At once this shadowy figure a bit of amusement now each day an every growingly obsession, a looming haunt always in the back of my mind. Never was it different from one day to the next , but over the years it was easy to see this was a man in grim black suit complete with over coat and hat.    For years I asked visitors that would stop by , “what they thought of the man at the end of my drive ?” always to be givng the same response “ Still on that kick” so in time I stoped asking , I came to except it was only myself that could see him. But as a say , what I saw , I saw , and he was real. As real as you or I.           By the second year Jason had moved out , my work had slowed down. To save some money on heating and other bills I pretty much moved myself completely into the nook , which now was more like a tiny apt. I had a small bed and fridge a microwave, my coffee pot . Sure I would still make it threw the maze the rest of the down stairs had become to make it into the kitchen if need be. But for the most part I was fine in my cubby.      With less work these days I found myself spending  more on my bench smoking my cigarettes watching my mystery man in black. With the difference being now slowly I could see he was approaching the house. Not each day could I notice, but slowly, ever so slowly he was making his way down the drive.        Until the morning I woke to look out the window and there he stood straight across the drive. I knew then , right then.. Who had come calling ! His eyes were hallow as if none were there at all. His face a slunken gray like dead skin draped across a skelton . No longer was his black suit of fine linen now a grab  more like canvas with a hood from the top of his head dragging past his feet. No more then I peered into his sullun face, he turned abruptly proceeding down the drive. I knew with out a doubt . His next stop was the front door.      Dizzzy, breathless, my knees week ,, I stammered back, the back of my knees hit a recliner I had set up. Into which I fell. Sitting there now lost reality was gone ,, where was I ? what was going on ? what had I done ? I reached for a cigarette to comfort me , to guide me, to give me answers.       And there I sat and smoked . Looking down on to my cracked and dried skin, stained yellow from years of tar and nicotine. I saw all the answers I was looking for.      With my own two hands I molded my own death , from once only a shadowy figure at the end of my drive to a creature from the underworld. I forged my own end, one cigarette at a time. One day after another ,one year after another, all the while knowing death was monitoring my every move. Why did I not stop? I could have quit ,millions do it every day. Why did I not run from this house? was I blind, a fool ? Or  an addict appeasing  myself,  to avoid the discomforts of nicotine withdrawal…     *rasp*rasp*rasp*        The cold steal of his scythe rattles the front glass…    Edited May 19, 2018 by jillar

    I never got to "meet" the man who wrote this, he died from cancer.......
    There have been a few, both on QSMB and here on the Q.T., that have influenced others markedly yet passed away from smoking related diseases. Very sad yet inspiring at the same time.      R.I.P. jwg & Queen Greenlover!

Posted 20 June 2014 - 03:14 AM  No I'm not trying to hypnotise you or play Jedi mind tricks.  I'm talking about relapsers or quitters who continue to have smoking thoughts and desires.        Nobody WANTS to go back to smoking. They quit because they want to quit (for whatever reason). What they want from time to time is to smoke. And what that means is something else. It means all of the things that people "like" about smoking:        A break in the day  Stress relief   Bonding time with buddies   Anxiety relief  Thinking time   Reward for finishing a job      etc     And it also means not having to THINK about not smoking all the time. Gawd I remember that. I remember thinking - "When will it ever end?...I just want to stop thinking about not smoking!" I see people saying it here all the time "I don't want to fight with myself any more! When will it end?!"      But it's not that you want to be a smoker again.        I reckon most smokers don't want to be smokers! If you gave someone a choice between being a smoker (with all the expense and smell and health fears and social shaming etc that goes with it) and being a happy non-smoker - of course they would choose the latter. But most smokers simply don't believe they can be happy without smoking. They believe they LOVE and need their cigarettes too much to live without them.      And when we quit it (generally) takes a lot of retraining for the brain to dismiss all of that addiction thinking and learn that we can actually get all of those good things in other ways without all the bad stuff you get with smoking. Some people are lucky and once they make the decision to quit, they are solid in it. Easy peasy. But lots of people struggle. And that's OK. The struggle is part of the process. Embrace it as part of the process. Look at it as the price of freedom. That's basically how I did it. I wanted freedom most of all. Freedom from smoking addiction and everything that went with it. The price became easier to pay over time. It took less. Every now and then I have a "want" to smoke but it's fleeting and easy to dismiss. Because I KNOW I do not want to be a smoker. No way.      Make a commitment to yourself. A promise. Promise yourself that you will never be a smoker again. And don't worry if you want to smoke from time to time. That's fine, because you know that it's really about something else and you definitely don't want to be a smoker again. No way. Ewgh.
    Thank you @jillar this sums its up for me in the here and now, it's great to see this post.  
    Glad it helped @Sslip  
    Awww, great post.  Thanks for sharing it.  Poprini was very insightful about the quit.  A great resource.  Would love to "chat" with her again.
    Great post...   There is no..one size fits all...   Some take the quick motorway road to Freedom ( ROME )....some take the slower scenic roiute...that's OK...as long as you get there..
    Great post. Sums up my thoughts exactly.
    Thanks. I really dont want to be a smoker. 
    Yep that’s so good to be reminded of. 
    Another great post, this one compliments of poprini 
    Hope everybody gets to bathe in Full Moon light tonight and celebrate your quits.                
    I've just noticed that my tongue is pink again. It looks healthy now.
    I bet your taste buds are thanking you too! No more smokey film build up covering them any longer. Have you noticed any difference in how certain foods taste to you now? It's not unusual to start developing a taste for foods you may previously had overlooked or even stop eating things you used to like as a smoker.

Yaaaaa....Brilliant ...that's one of the first thing I noticed too...all that gunk had cleared from my tongue.. You know that thick film we had as smokers... yuk....I remember feeling quite proud of that ... Your taste buds should spring into action now ...and your sense of smell...
    The Blood Flow helps the body in many areas,  clean tongue, rosy cheeks.... check this outSex, Health, Money & Time
    One of the first things I noticed too Phil but only because my tongue was so sore for the first three or four weeks. Guess it was from shedding that thick film and emerging new again. Reciprocity is right too about the food, 
    Saw the same thing myself.   You will be amazed at what happens over the next few weeks and months as you recover from all that nicotine and other junk that you inhaled.  Great job!!!

The increased sense of taste is outstanding. Even lettuce, cucumber etc. that I would previously have thought quite tasteless, now has a flavour.
    Just wait till you dump a big chunk of that stinky cheese in your mouth 
    I'm not sure if I ever noticed the colour of my tongue after quitting, but I do remember coughing up crap from my lungs for a while afterwards. Kind of gross, but so gratifying at the same time. It is amazing the transformation our bodies go through.   
Some conditions led to the relapse , My 3 year old Kid had a light accident , she fell from the chair and had to put stitch in the back of her head .   I had to smoke after coming from the hospital .     It was one of the worse days of my life .       I want to restart again .
    Sorry about your little one. Hope she is on the mend.       There are no valid reasons or excuses to smoke, you know that, don't you ?  Your quit must come first.  As Cristóbal says,  'You---->Your Quit---->Your Life        Please do more reading.  A lot more reading.    The facts about nicotine addiction must become as familiar as your name.        Once you have a deep understanding about addiction you will know that NOPE is the only way.     NOPE gives you super powers.        When is day one ?  Why wait another minute ?    You need to be there for your child !       We are here when you need.   
Glad to here your little one is ok ...  After smoking 52 years ...I used every reason to smoke ..   You'll be surprised how you cope with life so much better as a non smoker ..    Glad your back ...just jump on ,the best time to quit is now !!
Thanks a lot for the reply .    Yes , Thank god , She is alright now .      I have set my new quit date September 13 2019  , 9/13/2019 .        OK , I am restarting this Quit again .      I will soon put a new ticker too .      I now know a lot about controlling most of these urges and triggers .       Some days are plain dull no matter how hard you try .
    @Doreensfree        I have a question , i cant find a proper answer anywhere .      Does eating nicotine gums increase your sugar levels ?      Last time i did a blood test my sugar levels are a bit high .       I have control that too now

    Thanks a lot  everyone for the reply .      Yup , i have set my quit date . From that day on wards  i will be clean once again .    I am quitting again right now .     I have a high work load right now .     Everything should be alright within a month .       Time to set up a new ticker .    
    Glad your little girl is ok sunshine. I get the stress of you thinking you need to smoke but in reality its an excuse to smoke. Never smokers don't need to smoke when they're stressed so we need to change our mindset about needed to. Stay close and post BEFORE you cave so we can try to talk some sense into you!

    I agree. why wait? When did this happen anyway? You have been silent on this forum for some weeks now, although you have been logging in - just not posting.    As others have said in their own words, smoking is a choice YOU made. Not one you were forced to make. As JIllar said, a person who never smoked would not have picked up a cigarette and lit it in your situation. You need to understand that this whole smoking or not smoking thing is completely under your control - no one else can make the choices for you.    You know you can quit because you were quit for quit some number of months before so get back on the train and get it done for good this time.      I'm happy your little girl is OK too. I'm sure it was very frightening as a parent to have gone through what you did.
START NOW   You can Do it. Juan from argenitna trust you. 26 hs clean
    Pots I am very disappointed in your constant relapses.  You have been off and on smoking since I quit over a year ago.   Every time you appear, I truly hope you are serious about quitting,  You make a little headway and then disappear again.   It is time for you to make a choice to smoke or not to smoke.   No more excuses.  Let's get this done.

    Thanks everyone for the reply . I was a bit busy because of my exam time , my course will be over within a month , so i have a bit of high workload right now .         I also  learned something new today  . The feeling you get after you finish a cigarette is mostly a shitty one .        There is no point in depending on this crap for whatever it is .
Why wait to quit again?     If the feeling you get after finishing a smoke is shitty, you'd think you'd want to not smoke.      Just sayin'...       Edited September 10 by JimHannoonen
    And for the record, three days from now is NOT"as soon as possible".  I'm not sure who you're trying to fool (other than yourself).     As soon as possible would have been the second you put out that stanky butt you smoked.  You're making excuses. We've all done it.      Now either you want to quit or you don't. If you do, you won't smoke again. If you don't, you will. It really is that simple.
    Hey Pots, I'm glad your kid is ok.      Every time I hear a post from someone who relapses and says that they "had to smoke because..." I can't help but think of Cristobal's post that Sazerac shared,  Your Quit and Your Life - The Proper Sequence      A successful quitter realizes that they cannot smoke ever, no matter what life throws at them.  Relapsing and smoking a cigarette is a conscious decision.  No life event made the person light up.  The person decided to light up and relapse on their own.       A successful quitter must never allow a person or event influence them into lighting up again.      In order to successfully quit, you must never take another puff.  Yes, take it one day and one moment at a time but the ups and downs of life (which will always be there) cannot influence your quit.  You must be serious about this and realize the only thing that can make you smoke is yourself.      I agree with the other posters too.  Why wait?  There is no better time than now.  You keep torturing yourself with all of these relapses.      Start back now.  Commit to never taking another puff and reach out to this board anytime you feel tempted.  We all want to see you succeed but you are the one who has to make the commitment.
Thanks for all the replies ,        This is very weird , after months of suppressing and controlling it , all it takes is just one cigarette to again feel dependent on it .    Just one cigarette makes you want to smoke more cigarettes .        I have been stuck behind this computer following a distance education university course for the past 3 years now .  The only good thing is the course will end in one more month .      But this sitting , staring and studying for the past 3 years has made my overall health bad .       OK , Not extending the quit date to 9/13/2019 . Doing it today itself .     9/11/2019 11:32 AM

How many posts about people relapsing have you read here? It's ALWAYS the same story - 1 cigarette, even one puff, awakens your addiction again and makes you crave more cigarettes. It's the reason for NOPE. You know, that thing we pledge to ourselves every day.       Knowledge is power when you;re quitting. Read more of the posts people have made here Pots and research as much other material as you can about nicotine addiction. I really hope you can stay focused this time and that you have learned a valuable lesson about why NOPE is so critical to everyone's quit!

Thanks reciprocity and catlover ,       I have this project work to complete which is a lot of stress and i am doing it alone since its a distance education thing .    Otherwise i would stop sitting in front of my computer and have done a lot more outdoor activity .  This is really making me sick .     I feel like eating 2 or 3 gums daily to stop the addictive urges .Please do not discourage me from eating gums .    Its like something that helps me to stay focused on my studies .        The studies is going to end in October , and i am very happy about it too .     By the end of October i will have my Degree .Edited September 11 by Sunshine59
If you need the nicotine gum to maintain your quit until you graduate then I say do it. Quitting is #1 priority. How you do it is up to you but, please have it in your mind that once you get through this stressful time with your degree, slowly get off the gum then.
reciprocity ,   Thanks for the reply .  That is a really good idea .    I will eat 2 or 3 gums daily until this whole education thing is over . After that i am going to get out more and start working out in a gym .  Enough sitting and staring behind a computer .  I want to regain my health back
    Sunshine, there's nothing wrong with using the nicotine gum to stop smoking. Many people have been successful at it. The reason you should have a quit day for the gum too is that the nicotine in them is what keeps you craving. Nicotine is highly addictive and unless you wean yourself off it eventually, you'll risk caving to smoking again.
Thanks jillar , For me nicotine gums are very very effective .  Every time i have a craving or a thought about cigarette i eat a gum and it goes away . When i run out of it for 3 or 4 days , i have that urges back again .   I have no idea why some people tell me to go cold turkey instead of using gums .        I have been hit by a high sugar few days ago , i was very confused .    I don't know if its the gums i eat that caused it .     Anyway for some more time , i am going to eat it .  3 gums a day and i don't even have to think about cigarettes .      Right now i am only concerned about my blood sugar levels .     Going to see a doctor tomorrow .

    Going well. That is all.        Haven't been posting much or using the daily nope pledge. I'm trying not to think about it as much this time. I became a bit too reliant on this place last time, beating myself up for missing nopes and stuff like that.      I'll just keep popping in randomly over the coming months to let you know how I'm getting on. I pop in every now and again to watch videos posted by others aswell. They are most helpful as is reading some of the testimonies on here.

    Welcome back tocevoD, all the best on your new journey.
4 days is great, drink lots of water to flush out the system
    Congratulations on your quit !  I am so glad you avail yourself to the plethora of information here,    please continue your education about our addiction and  thanks for keeping us updated.  We worry, you know.
3 runs completed this last week.        A 2 and a half miler on Tuesday and Wednesday and a 6 miler last night (Saturday).      The key for me is to keep exercising. I feel the benefits and it helps with my quit. Entering runs in the local area with the money being saved from not smoking.

"The key for me is to keep exercising" 2 things happened, i got back into great shape and i became an ex smoker. I replaced the cigg with exercise, when that carving came " move a muscle, change a thought"...
    Absolutely made up with how my quit is moving along. Doing dry January, doing plenty of exercise and watching plenty of films and a little reading. All helping. Every time I get a small urge, because that's all they've been so far, I weigh that one little urge in time up against the time smoking has not even entered my mind and I feel empowered.     Onwards and upwards people. 
    You're doing great tocevod, I'm super happy for you 
    Wow, you are doing great.  Keep on running!
    Good work ...T...your doing great !!!!....
    Congratulations on your Two Weeks of freedom !  So happy to see you building a powerful and sturdy quit.
Great job!  I found great joy & relief in small victories. 1 hour to one day to one week. And ten dollars saved to twenty, thirty...thousands!      Find your motivation for KTQ & cling to it as if your life depends on it...
Over a month now and feeling absolutely super. Done a timed 5k today around the local racecourse. Went and had a bit of food straight after then an hour later did another 2 and a half miles. Stuff like this I would never have been able to do if still addicted to the demon nicotine.      I'm starting to look at smokers in a different way aswell. It's a way I've never looked at them in the past when I quit smoking. I used to envy them and hate seeing people smoking because I always wanted to be smoking again. This quit I am now seeing them in a different way. I'm pitying the way they are addicted to nicotine. Pitying the fact they spend so much money. Pitying that they just have to smoke to get the hitnif nicotine. Also looking at vapours in the same way. I see it all now as more an addiction to nicotine than enjoying smoking and that makes this different to me.
    It sounds like you are understanding nicotine addiction, tocevoD.   This is a great tool in your arsenal and a watershed moment.    To pity and have compassion for nicotine addicts is an important transition from being envious about smoking like you are missing something.    All you are missing is a likely painful life and death and slavery to big tobacco.  Now, you are running with renewed life and vitality.   How grand !
    Good stuff tocevod, congratulations! 
    Well done @tocevoD..... Your seeing smoking for what it really is ...this is great !!!
Been a good few months for me. Been running very regularly. My latest competitive run was a 10k which I completed in 58mins 08secs. I am still at an early stage in my running but I can feel the benefits of not smoking which is a great thing for me personally. Hoping that the fitter I get the more time I can shave off. When I go out for a drink I am still struggling with the demon ciggies but when not drinking I don't have any thought or need of smoking. It's a strange situation for me, but one I totally accept. Drinking brings my defences down. I hardly go out for a drink now so that's a bonus.       As I say the benefits I am feeling from not smoking are amazing so I just need to keep on doing what I am doing.
    You are doing awesome tocevoD.   I think the challenge to run has really powered your quit.  You may always have that little nudge to smoke when drinking but now you have the power to control.  It is probably best to avoid those situations in your early stages of being quit.  Keep that quit going and run on!!!!!
    Great to see you're doing well tocevoD, and congratulations on almost four months quit

I just enjoy the runs but I've always timed and set myself targets. One target was to do a lap of the local park in under 20mins. Been trying for years, it's 2.3miles around. I finally did it the other day. Done the full lap in 19mins 40secs. With these little achievements coming thick and fast it is a great spur to stay quit. My lungs are clearing and times are falling.

    Congratulations on your quit, TocevoD as well as getting into running.  I'm glad your quit has allowed you to look into other healthy lifestyle choices as well.
Haven't posted for a while. Just thought I'd drop in and let you all know how I'm doing.        Well where to start? A rollercoaster year for me. Massive achievement's mixed with abject failures. Achievement's being the running, which is still going well albeit after a short hiatus due to niggling little injuries.     Failures being the couple of times I have actually smoked. Single days out being the main culprits, once at an all day music gig and two separate days out on the demon drink. I don't know why I bother drinking it always leads to smoking. There was one longer period of smoking which lasted a week. It started off with a 3 day holiday and when I returned from holiday I finished the rest of the week smoking. That was the beginning of August and that was the last time I smoked.       I seem to get to a point in my quit and then start looking for a reason to smoke. Before the 3 day holiday I had made my mind up I was going to be smoking for the 3 days. The grip had got me that much. Same with the one day music gig, I had decided before it I would be smoking that day.     I feel now like I will never smoke again. I have no feeling for it and no desire. I'm currently loving running and I have taken onboard a lot of the Allen Carr books teachings of the nicotine trap. I totally get what he is saying. I feel like the final hurdle is these urges that come out of nowhere that make me plan when I'm going to smoke. As I say at this moment there is no need or desire. It always comes with alcohol but I have no alcohol days planned. The cure could be to go out and have the day out if I must but to pre plan to leave when the urge comes. Just slope off to save my own sanity. It's more important than being a social, jovial soul.Edited September 11 by tocevoD.
tocevoD, when I quit I was determined to keep enjoying my couple of beers in the evenings. I mean really, if I had to give that up to than I'd be perfect and who wants to be around that lol. Anyway, I stayed close to home for a good month. Only venturing out if my never smoker hubby could accompany me because I didn't trust myself and I made sure to have my couple of beers each evening. Even when I wasn't feeling like a beer. And it worked, drinking is not a factor at all and hasn't been from the start of my quit. Maybe try that this time?   Thanks for checking in, its good to see you  Edited September 11 by jillar

Change your quit date from 31/12/18 to the date you actually quit smoking.  (so we can plan all your celebrations)      Drinking and smoking can often be real problems in a quit.  I have friends that only smoke when they drink and then go weeks without smoking.   It still means they have a nicotine addiction and it is the addiction we must confront.     For me, I kept away from alcohol for a few weeks and then just went for it. I drank and didn't have any craves that I couldn't/wouldn't defeat. It is a state of mind.  Either you smoke or you don't smoke.        Drinking will not lead you to smoking if you don't smoke,   it will only lead to smoking if you want it to.  If you are sabotaging your quit, you will undoubtedly succeed.         I would ask you to consider why you relapsed.   Alcohol only lightens our inhibitions but, there may be a  chink in your armor that lets addiction through. Your commitment needs to be rock solid w/ no misgivings or doubts and you need to be alert, awake and aware.    Putting Nicotine Addiction to sleep is serious business, a formidable opponent and not to be taken lightly at any time.     Hope Alan Carr can help you understand, he has helped so many.      This vid from our friend, Joel Spitzer, may also give you some clarity.      Edited September 11 by Sazerac
    Glad to hear from you again, sad that you had to start your quit again.  All I can say is that you must commit to quitting smoking at all times.  Like you stated it seems that you pre-planned your smoking days/times -- giving in before the craves.  That type of thinking you need to stop as it comes up or make a  plan to overcome those desires and not to "miss" smoking.  Quitting is not the easiest thing but it is doable -- just come here more often to get some support and education, it really helps.  Anyway glad your at it again--- keep focused and keep strong!!!

Over 465 football teams play in the age groups up to under-11s in Liverpool with about 40,000 adults coming to cheer them on throughout the season. In Liverpool, whilst only about 15 per cent of adults smoke, research shows that if children are around adults who smoke they think it is more common than it actually is.

Smokefree Sidelines is all about setting a great example for our children and making sure they have a healthy future"
It's been like that in California for years now. Same with bars and restaurants. The newest place they've added is all parks. There's pretty much nowhere that smoking is allowed here. So anyone who is having an extra hard time quitting should move to California lol       PS. That includes vaping!Edited September 8 by jillar
    Been that way for awhile in Ontario. Can't smoke in a whole lot of places here:https://www.ontario.ca/page/where-you-cant-smoke-or-vape-ontario  
Is it really enforced though?   When I was still smoking, I would smoke outside with impunity (unless it was a child centric area, in which case a weird looking stranger hanging around kids and smoking would trigger a different kind of response than OMG someone is smoking)       Anyway though, outside I never was told to put it out, or move, or issued a citation.  that included hotels or businesses that said no smoking in front of building.   Heck, even the employees would stand out there to smoke.         It’s kind of like my high school (early 80s).  Officially there was no smoking on or in school grounds, but the teachers/staff wouldn’t enforce it if you just walked out to the school  parking lot.  You could smoke in the open if you were outside the building.   If they caught you inside though, you might be punished (depending on who caught you) which might just be an unofficial punishment of confiscating your cigarettes and lighter or the full blown after school detention and parental notification.   Although back then, the parents likely knew already and allowed it.

You're right. Local bylaws are rarely enforced as written but, they are there on the books at least so if some authority does get pissed at you, they can have you charged. It is enough to keep most reasonable people in line. I find most smokers are OK with these laws. I know I didn't want to make nonsmokers uncomfortable when I smoked and would go out of my way to avoid smoking in close public spaces.
I received a text asking me to make an appointment to see the doc.  I expected this because I went to have the circulation in my leg tested on the 22/8/19 and it had got worse.    It will be for the doc to persuade me to quit smoking I'm sure so I'm very much looking forward to saying that I quit on the 23rd. I'll be very proud to say that.
    And he'll be super happy for you too. Especially if you show better results now that you're almost a month into your quit 
    The doctor will be very happy that you have made the move already for me.  Similar situation for me when I quit and the doctor was over the moon!!!
    Good luck with your appointment.    These links from our friend, Joel Spitzer,  have to do with peripheral vascular issues.  mad-that-i-cant-smoke-anymore   the-power-of-nicotine-addiction/    heart-and-circulatory-diseases          
    There is also this from Joel,Are Doctors Taught About Nicotine Recovery
    Dr.'s are always delighted to hear that you have quit - that's for sure. Even your dentist will be thrilled as smoking has a huge negative impact on dental issues. Another benefits of quitting .... you get to say loud and clear, I quit smoking, rather than fumbling for words to indicate you know you should quit but haven't started yet  
    So pleased you have quit, what great news for you to tell your doctor.  Congrats on nearly three weeks 
    I agree with all above ...your Doc will be very pleased ..
    I am sure your doctor will be happy that you have quit and it will feel great to tell him the awesome news.     I hope all goes well with your doctor's appointment and keep up the great work!
Glad you're sticking with the quit! I wish my BF would quit for this reason. He complains that from the knees down his circulation is bad and causes either a burning sensation or numbness. He refuses to go to the Dr. saying he'd rather not know. Both his coworker and I have really gotten on his butt about it since he said he would quit after I finished my radiation treatment however 2wks out and it seems he's smoking and drinking more . I wish I could force him but it falls on deaf ears.

Had a couple guys come to the house today to do some warranty work on our whole house fan and I'll be damned if I've smelled anything more rank. They were both either heavy smokers or had just finished smoking before they came in.      I smell smoke here and there when outdoors and it's gross and all, but I haven't had a smoker in my house before (other than me when I smoked). I just can't get over how bad the funk is. They smelled like walking ash trays.     I don't know how my non-smoking girlfriend put up with me for so long.      /rantEdited September 9 by JimHannoonen
Same with my never smoker hubby Jim! It's so embarrassing to know that we smelled like that for, in my case, 35 years
I can tell when the neighbors across the street (40 yards away) I can barely stand the smell.  To this day I am embarrassed by how I must of smelled to others, especially my grandchildren. Helps me keep perspective on my own quit!!!!
Yup, it is pretty awful that stink! I almost had a huge fight with one of my sisters because I blurted out "You stink!" when she walked into the house from outside at the family Christmas party last year. She is still smoking like a chimney....but is talking about quitting "one of these days"....I hope she does soon before it's too late!Edited September 10 by Rozuki
In 1997 I quit for seven years and then started again. We all know it's like being an alcoholic in that one puff and we're back to square one and my story proves it.   My delusional thinking when I started again went like this. My friends and I went on a mini trip to Poland so I thought that it didn't really count as real smoking because I was abroad and not at home, which would constitute real smoking obviously     Of course, because it wasn't real, I would easily quit again the moment I arrived back in the UK. Oh, when I meant back in the UK I didn't include when back at Manchester airport because that's sort of still half abroad isn't it?   So when I got back home I was full of good intent for a few hours but because it was still the same day as when we were in Poland, I might as well carry on just for the day and stop tomorrow as I was still sort of over there in my mind because I'd left only a few hours previously. I will definitely give up tomorrow, I told myself.    Well, tomorrow took an awful long time to arrive. It arrived on the 22nd August 2019.
I can't imagine quitting for so many years and going back.  Sharing your experience makes me realize I will have to address my quit everyday.  Not One Puff Ever the rest of my life.Edited September 5 by Linda Thomas
    We must always remain cognizant of our addiction    and jump on junkie thoughts Immediately before they manifest.Red Flags  Complacency is idiotic.     So happy you are with us, @mightyboosh !    Your experience lights the way.      
    Thanks for sharing mighty. We are indeed addicts for life. It just becomes very easy to maintain abstinence once our quits are strongly established. the only fly in the ointment is that it is super easy to toss that all away if we ever allow junkie thinking to once again take hold in our brain. Your story illustrates this very clearly Mightyboosh! This can happen to any one of us if we get careless at some future point.     Much easier to maintain than to rebuild - much easier!

    Thank you for the great Reminder ...once a addict always a addict...we are all one puff away .. Always be in our guard ...  I carnt imagine how I would feel if I lost this quit ...I don't think I would have another one in me ...    It would mean me being in deep trouble ...  Never take that puff ...
    Took a holiday to NYC last week and saw this on the wall of a convenience store. I thought smokes were expensive here in CA.        What's crazy is that there are a LOT of people that smoke there. I can't see how they afford it!         
    Wow, that's expensive!!!
They should have an electronic sign like gas stations so they can be up to the minute when prices change        I think smokers in NYC probably get their smokes from outside the city.Edited September 3 by Wayne045
    I would've paid it back in the day. I would have scrounged and looked between seat cushions for the change !
I can't believe I paid $6.00 a pack. I don't know how anyone could afford the habit at that price.  I am so glad to be spending my money elsewhere!
Go to Australia if you want a real shocker for the cost of a pack of smokes.Then there's Saint Martin, in the Caribbean. Price per Carton!! (10 packs of 20):

    That price is insane.....but I would have probably paid it too. The addiction is real.

    Before it was a federal law, California enacted fire safe cigarettes as a law first so I sent money to Florida each month for my mom and sis to buy the 'good' ones and send them out to me. Plus they were cheaper there. But once the rest of the state's were forced to follow suit I just bought them here. But boy did I hoard those Florida cigarettes, didn't share them with anyone who would ask to bum one lol

    I never saved half a cigarette.  If I did not finish one, before my destination, I would just throw it away.  I thought it was so gross when people would snuff the end and save them.      What a waste of money.   It amazes me now, how many times I tried to squeeze one in.

    I had snipes stashed everywhere and was too parsimonious to waste dog ends if they were big enough to light again.  I would snip off the burnt end and blow to get the old smoke out...this kept them 'fresher tasting' ?  gah.     Mostly everything was smoked down to the nub.  My poor delicate lungs...what a daily catastrophe for them, for me.      I am astoundingly proud of myself for putting down this addiction.  I am incredibly proud of all of you, also.

If the price of a pack of cigarettes suddenly doubled, I wonder how many people would quit. But when they creep up, the impact doesn't feel so great. "Hey, it's just another 50 cents."    Or maybe that's just me. Because that's what I would think to myself.

That's why people addicted to heroin would spend money on their drug before food. That's why they would steal from their own mother or father to support their addiction. It's the same with nicotine addiction. Cost is only an annoyance - not a barrier.        The money saved since I quit is nice for sure but it is NOT the number one or even number 2 benefit to quitting.
    saw this down the street, I noticed the cigarette butt right off.
    I too would have paid the asking price ...no matter what when I was a smoker ...    And I would have saved half ...even a quarter of I got a puff out of my beloved cig ... Waste not ....  But remember I was ...I mean I am a addict .....and would have done anything for my fix ... Now I choose not to indulge...to the disgusting stinky addiction ..
I posted elsewhere about when I gave up in 1997 and that reminded me of how I managed to do that way back then. It was with the help of Allen Carr's book 'Easy way to stop smoking.' What he convinced me about was that smoking isn't a pleasure, it's just pure addiction overlaid with the fantasy that it is an actual enjoyable thing to do such as eating or drinking a fine wine. This was a big moment when I realised this because smokers convince themselves that it is a bona fide, stand alone pleasure.  I can't remember if this was in the book or I've thought it up but none of us would look at a glue - sniffer on the street and be jealous and think we're missing out on a pleasure. No, we'd see it for what it is, a harmful addiction to a horrible substance. That's what smoking is, nothing else.     People who have never smoked don't envy those that do.
You know what? Ever since I quit I have only looked at people smoking with pity. Knowing they probably would like to quit, or at least have at some point, but there they stand - slaves to their addiction; still! I often wonder how many people looked at me in that light when I was a smoker? You're right though. Smoking is looked at through a different lens. That IS changing now though. You are looked upon as undesirable now if you're a smoker, at least in most circles.Edited September 5 by reciprocity

    I also read this great book...  What  jump out at me was I realized I was a addict ...me a addict ..I just thought I was a lady who deserves a reward for ...well just about anything ...   This was a massive light bulb moment for me ...
I read the book.  It finally clicked. Cigarette to my lips to deliver smoke to my lungs was eerily similar to needle to vein to deliver heroin to blood.  They both fed the demon and gave us that “ahhhhh” relief. Found some YouTube clips of him. Watched over & over.   Extremely instrumental in my quit along with being active on a forum like this.          Edited September 7 by Lust4Life
    I've noticed a very insidious trick that the NM uses. Prior to quitting, the environment seemed full of quit advice such as literature at pharmacies, doctors surgeries etc.    Now that I've quit, the NM seems to have sneaked around and removed a lot of it. Honestly, the day after I quit, my chemist's little health advice table was lacking in the usual stop smoking advice leaflets. Similarly with my doctor's surgery.     To rub it in the NM has got into my sister's mind.  Being an ex nurse she was always banging on about why I should quit but just before I did, I mentioned maybe giving up and she said, "Well, they're your lungs, it's nothing to do with me." I couldn't believe it. The moral of the tale folks is that the demon will never go away, it just adapts and morphs into an even more devilish entity.  I just say, "Get thee behind me Nico Monster, I'm a NOPE guy."
    That is the attitude Mightyboosh.  You just keep Noping and showing that Nico Monster who is in control.  He may never go away but will eventually become a distant memory.  Just keep looking forward to a life of freedom!
    Take control of your thoughts as quickly as possible.   Breathe Deep.   Look at something of beauty.    Reward yourself for every reclaimed receptor !
    The NM has NO power mighty - YOU do. That's why he needs you to act on his behalf. You are right though, he's a sneaky little bastard and will absolutely know when you are at your weakest point before he pounces. Give him the finger    What's really going on is your own brain (which is used to junkie thinking) battling against you because you have stopped supplying what is craves - nicotine. Don't worry though because the more distance you put between you and smoking, the NM will slowly die. It just takes time. It WILL happen though  
    Oh yes the nicomonster will try any and every trick in the book to win you back, especially during this first hard month. When I was having a bad day I knew to either stay close to home or ask my husband to go with me because I didn't trust myself not to give in. Heck I even drank a few extra beers once just so I wouldn't be able to drive to the store lol.  Just keep telling yourself that this too shall pass and when it does its one more trigger you've defeated making the next time much easier. You're doing great and love your ticker 
    Yes the NM lurks behind many corners ready to latch on -- but the more you NOPE and not submit to the NM the less power it has and the more it disappears.  Be strong as you are and be ever vigilant -- you can do this!!!

    We all know what it feels like but how would you describe it?   For me the biggest factor of a craving is the desire to feel a 'hit' at the back of the throat. That's why I use very strong liquorice tablets and mints and they help. How about you?
    For me it was wanting that first deep inhale of the cigarette, it was a strong desire.  Certain activities that I had tied to smoking would set that crave off.  I used Jillar's Air Cigarette to combat that crave (that and a cold juice) and that really worked!!!
        As a smoker, it was the obsessive thought that I needed a cigarette at that moment.  As a nonsmoker,  it is an obsessive thought that I think I want a cigarette.  That is all it is - a thought.   It is a thought that does not have to be acted on.  It is a thought that no longer controls me.
    A craving for me was the constant thought of having just one to make me feel better. Like martian my Jillar air cigarette worked every time to trick my mind and help me past the craving. That and soft peppermint puffs. Bought them by the bucket that whole first year and oddly enough haven't craved them since lol
I didn't understand this concept of "a craving" in the early days of my quit (almost the entire 1st month) because if I was awake, I was almost overwhelmed with the desire to smoke. It had no beginning and no end. I just didn't think about it as often when I kept myself busy. occupied and distracted. It wasn't until later that I would occasionally get a sudden urge to have a smoke. I mostly couldn't tie those to "triggers" either. It would just come out of nowhere when I was almost anything - sometimes nothing at all. I was never really tempted to smoke due to stress or life situations. I suppose I was able to keep my life and my quit separate like that. What was in my brain in terms of what I thought a cigarette would do for me? Not really sure. I guess that Ahhhhh feeling of pleasure from taking those first couple of drags. Sure am glad I never gave it up though.
    I remember inhaling and feeling that first endorphin hit,  a feeling of happy, satisfying relief !  (sounds like an old cigarette ad, lol)  Now, I get that bump with oxygen.    Oxygen and a short break to notice something of beauty.    Deep breaths are handy.     I certainly remember the headfuck and still, snippets of its oppression pop up every blue moon. Nicotine addiction appropriated a lot of real estate in the brain, happily reclaimable. It's a service, really,  to remind me of NOPE.
    It was constant niggle....a tap on my shoulder ..hey bet you would love a smoke ...that Nico Monster ...    I remember telling it to naff off....I'm a non smoker ....  I've took smoking off the table ..
    At first craves made me angry and frustrated that I hadn’t waited another week/ month to quit. Angry that the rest of the world still got to smoke, then after a few weeks the knowing that even if I did take a puff now, it wouldn’t taste the same, wouldn’t give me the same satisfaction. I mourned those carefree smoke days. So glad I stuck it out and stayed positive. Life is now calm and settled.

    Yep no stinky fingers...
The physical dependency of addiction played a role in my cravings.  There was also the impulse of instant gratification.        However, a big part of my early cravings was little more than a desire for a return to normalcy.  Normalcy at the time meant just going back to smoking when I was used to smoking.  I was out of my comfort zone for a while and frankly didn't know what to do with myself at times without a cigarette.  I was having to act very deliberately not to light one up.  It was tempting at times to just go on autopilot and smoke like I had for the previous quarter-century.     Funny really...In March 2016, smoking felt so normal I couldn't imagine life without it.  Now, September 2019, and smoking a cigarette would feel as weird to me as lighting my hair on fire.  Never again.
    What did you guys find being the hardest part when you stopped smoking?         Was it the actual physical craving, absolutely need to have one now?    Was it the social aspect? Did smoking become a part of you? Was it the change you would have to make?   Was it because it was just what you were used to?   Something else?     -- For me it was mostly the change and that I was used to it. But mostly change, I'd now suddenly have to cope in situations where I'd smoked before, I thought I'd lost some level of comfort. I remember feeling like it was a proper new day every day in the beginning, as I was basically fighting against the comforts that I knew at the time. Oh how distant all of that now seems. 
    My hardest part probably was the insomnia and the constant thinking about cigarettes
    I had a number of short quits lasting from a few days to a few weeks.       After my first failed quit, I think I had an idea of what to expect early on.  I was usually able to make it through the first few days (when it is said that nicotine leaves the body) but I had trouble remaining focused and vigilant long term.  After a few weeks and starting to feel a bit better, I fell into the old trap of thinking that one cigarette wouldn't hurt (which is a horrible trap to fall into).        I guess what I'm saying is that it was easy for me to quit but it was hard to stay quit.  Remaining focused and accepting that smoking was not an option, regardless of what life threw at me, is what kept me quit long term...it just took effort and a change of mindset.
    It was a challenge to banish my smokey thoughts and break up my patterns.       I hollered, FREE YOUR HEAD.  All The Time.      Then, I purposefully replaced smokey thoughts by looking at something beautiful.    Like, that light on that leaf.  or listened to a favorite piece of music    or spent a moment in a happy memory.    These became my rewards.
    The emptiness of it all. Sooo much more time on my hands and nothing to do but think about how I wanted to have a smoke. I did no planning on getting into some new activity to fill all that extra time I suddenly had. Had I to do this all over again now, I probably would have bought some puzzles to do or joined a gym or something that I could have thrown myself at. The early days were tough ..... no question. Feel your way along a day at a time and remain true to your own self commitment. Those are the thoughts that got me through I think. That and the fact it was so uncomfortable, I never wanted to go through it again! Had I failed that first time, i'm pretty sure I'd still be a smoker now.

    I had smoked the best part of my life ...   I had to adjust to just being me ....without my crutch....I match it ,to  a toddler learning all about life for the first time ..   Everything was new ...  I didn't even know how to be ...just me ....it felt so different ...    Of course if I knew all those years ago ...how wonderful being smoke free would be ....I love the new me

    The Hardest Part, barre none, is deciding:  "It's Time To Quit ==>  NOW " ...   All the rest is pretty easy.    EZPZ
Trying to get thru all the familiar times that I would smoke  -- The times that I "enjoyed" smoking and getting that type of thinking out of my head, that I really could be a non smoker!!!!       As well as much of what is said thru out this thread!!!Edited September 3 by Martian5
I found this site online while I was searching for the answer to a question.        I quit smoking almost 6-1/2 years ago and have not had one puff of anything since. I despise the smell of cigarette smoke. But WHY do I still smoke in my dreams? At least once a week I have a dream and I'm smoking in it.        After this long, certainly the habits and cravings are long gone so why on Earth do I smoke cigarettes in my dreams? The only "answer" I found online is I'm craving nicotine, which I'm clearly not.       Thank you in advance for any insights.      Jazz
Hi Jazzmine! Welcome to the Train and congrats on over 6 years quit  I'm certainly no expert on dreams, but I would think it probably has nothing to do with you subconsciously wanting to smoke or still craving to smoke but rather some sort of imprint on your brain that was crafted during all the years you smoked and it is somehow summonsed when you dream? That's my best guess anyway but the important thing is that you don't act on it. What you do when you're awake is the critical thing so just keep the quit you have. That's all you really need to do. Feel free to hang around if you like. We're a pretty close group here who all have one thing in that we are all quitters and stick around to try and help others looking to put their nicotine addiction to sleep.
    Dreams are really common in the early days of a quit as the lung's cilia sheds the poisons. This can alert your sense of smell and taste and migrate into your dream.       Do you have some subconscious or conscious ambivalence about your quit ?    Do you still romanticize about smoking ?    Do any of these Red Flags  ring a bell  ?       Nicotine Addiction doesn't go away, we can put it to sleep for a long time  but, it is instantly re-activated after one puff.   That is why we commit to NOPE (Not One Puff EVER)   Vigilance is essential, no matter how long we have quit.        Congratulations on your Six Years of Freedom, @Jazzmine  !  and welcome to the QTrain.  Protect your quit.  S    
interesting question Jazzmine.  I too have dreams where I am smoking to this day -- and I mean I fully experience smoking so much I feel like I have broken my quit upon waking up.  As said above I believe it is imprinted in the brain as are other experiences you have gone thru.  So long as it is not in your daily waking life and you are not really craving I believe that you are good.  And by the way awesome job on the 6 1/2 year quit!!!        By the way not a weird question, I have asked or mentioned here a couple/three times!!!!!!Edited August 21 by Martian5
    Thank you all! I have woken up, upset that I've broken my quit. It's so strange to me! I definitely think I romanticized smoking in the sense that I always felt it calmed me, which is a normal reaction to feeding an addiction. There are still RARE times I think having a drag would be amazing, BUT then I think it would taste like ass and I see other people smoking and it looks and smells disgusting. I also would never disappoint myself by smoking again. Being a quitter is amazing!
    Welcome aboard jazzmine, congrats on that awesome quit you have  I wouldn't worry about it since you don't wake up craving a smoke after you have one of those dreams.  I think that even though over six years quit is a long time, you probably smoked for much longer than that so I would imagine that it could take another six years before those dreams stop, or at least occur less often.  Or maybe getting it off your chest is all that was needed and after today you never have one again

Don't ever do that please
    The more information we acquire about nicotine addiction,   the better prepared we are to identify triggers or chinks in our armor. We need to be ferocious and completely truthful with ourselves  to conquer this addiction.  If you know you still harbor some romance, you have the skills to route out those thoughts  well before they lead you astray.   Keep your focus.  This whole quitting smoking business is a continuing journey, for true.

But WHY do I still smoke in my dreams? At least once a week I have a dream and I'm smoking in it.                Dreams are fascinating and confusing.  A lot of subconscious clutter comes to the surface when we dream.  Many studies have been performed and many smart people have spent time thinking about the subject.  And still, there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason as to why we dream the dreams we dream.      Smoking is an addiction that encompassed every facet of our life.  We smoked cigarettes all day.  We smoked through the entire gamut of emotional states.  The cigarette was always there and in turn became a part of our identity.  Then we quit.  The process of quitting forced us to undo years of conditioning.  Quitting smoking brings about a seismic shift in our brains.  I suppose that the dreams could be little more than lingering remnants of the years we spent conditioning our brains to believe in the cigarette and identify as a smoker.     Vivid dreams can produce powerful feelings.  The realization that it was just a dream should provide comfort.  I wouldn't sweat it if I were you.       By the way, congratulations on six-and-a-half years of freedom.
Hello and welcome Jazz...   I have never had one of those smoking dreams that some folk experience....Thankfully... I never dream full stop ...I don't think I go in to a deep sleep enough ... I can only imagine how annoying this must be over 6 years of Quitting...It just shows the power of the mind ..and how smoking was inbeded in our brains and memories... All you can do is keep rejoicing youv,e quit ,and hopefully they will in time disappear......   Congrats by the way on a Quit to be proud of ,for sure ...and it would be nice for you to stick around and support  the folks who follow you ...
    Welcome to the site, Jazzmine and congrats on a fabulous quit.      I had regular smoking dreams for several years after I quit.  I can't remember the last one I had but they can be very scary and it was frustrating that I continued to have them for so long.      Nobody seems to really have a concrete understanding of what dreams mean despite a lot of fascinating studies that have been done over the years regarding them.  Regarding smoking dreams, I think smoking was such a big part of our lives for so long that it can still regularly be a part of our subconscious world long after we've quit.  That's my theory at least.     Those dreams are frustrating but as long as you don't light up in the awake world, you are ok.
I haven't had a single craving or even passing thought of smoking in well over fifteen years, yet I have periodic smoking dreams like the ones you describe.  They're deeply unsettling.  A friend of mine who has advanced training in psychology and whose insights I value suggested to me a few years ago that the dreams probably have nothing to do with my quit proper and instead may be a way for my subconscious to examine/express broader issues like success/failure, the "imposter syndrome," etc.        Christian99 17 1/2+ Years Quit
I don't remember where but I read someone suggesting that smoking dreams may actually be a physical reaction to your body (specifically, your lungs) pushing up and out some of the cigarette waste.  The taste of whatever it is triggers your memory.  You somewhat taste tar so your brain kicks into gear and provides the context (a smoking dream) to explain it.  Because that was the last time you "sensed" whatever it is.        That being said, 6.5 years later seems a bit long for the lungs to still be getting rid of smoke crud.

Sometimes dreams can be a symbolic representation of a concept (like dreaming of being naked).  Would you have any other habit or something in your life that 'could' be represented by the smoking dream?      I'm not a dream expert so don't really know but there may be people who could help interpret the dream.Edited August 30 by d2e8b8
@Jazzmine I get this too from time to time and I quit 7+ years ago. For me this has always been the addiction speaking, it amazes me how strong it is. While my awake brain may not even think about smoking my subconscious mind does. After these dreams I'm always really confused/distraught at the fact that I've smoked and it takes me a good while to realise I've not actually messed this up. Sometimes I'm confused in the dream too. it's the power of addiction. Edited September 1 by greenlight
    I think a dream is just a dream.   I've had smoking dreams, but I also do other stuff in dreams that I have/haven't done in real life.   Like I remember this one dream that I was back working my very first job as a sacker at a grocery store and then suddenly the scene changes to me helping my old high school English teacher fix her car.   The job is a real thing that happened, but hanging out with my high school English teacher, that never happened, and I've never fixed a car before (beyond changing a flat tire).      I just go with the flow.
    I used to think I did not have the willpower to quit smoking.  Every attempt, my thoughts would drift back to needing that cigarette and the excuses of why I could not quit.   Last night, as I lay in bed, I could not get this word out of my mind.  I realized that, over the past year, this word has really changed meaning for me.   I always had the willpower to quit smoking, I just did not know how to do it.  Stumbling across this forum was a life changer for me.   We all have the power to change our lives for the better, but many times we do not feel we have the strength or "will" to do so.  That has a lot to do with our self esteem.  How can we not feel lowly about ourselves, when we are addicted to a behavior that is destroying ourselves.   Know that you can change your life and , in my case, the meaning of this word.  Now that I have quit smoking, I have the willpower to do anything I want.  I have the willpower to stay in control of my life.  What a wonderful feeling.    
    Your transformation has been so encouraging, Linda. This is my favorite part about being here, watching people begin to trust themselves, care about themselves and make even more changes in their life to nurture themselves, to make themselves better humans.       I am so happy you continue to shine your light on us and encourage us all.  Thank you so much.      Quitting smoking is the best thing anyone can do for themselves and their friends and family.   The lessons learned lead to an inner strength and a great compassion also.

It's wonderful to watch a newbie travel on their road to Freedom...Growing confidence ,and strength in every aspect of their lives.....
    Smoking affects so many aspects of our lives in a negative manner and we never even think about that as addicts. We use smoking to hide away from so many things in our lives. When we quit, it's sort of the same thing in reverse but all the effects are positive  It's too bad we don't realize this before we quit or even in the early days of our quit. It's only after we've gone through the process that we actually get it!   It's nice to enjoy life again the way it should be

Here is an article I found googling around dealing with the Quitting Smoking Blues.This is from the Very Well Mind website   Depression Related to Quitting SmokingHow to Deal With the Temporary Mood ChangesBy Terry Martin | Reviewed by Sanja Jelic, MDUpdated August 29, 2018   Quitting smoking is difficult enough when you're feeling happy. Unfortunately, it can become further challenging due to depression—a common complaint early on in smoking cessation.Knowing what you may experience as you work to become smoke-free can better prepare you for the journey ahead. If you start to feel depressed after quitting tobacco and your low mood doesn't pass after a few weeks or gets worse, be sure to check in with your doctor for advice.   Physical and Psychological Changes  Nicotine withdrawal is the primary reason for the temporary depression you may experience after quitting smoking. When you use nicotine on a regular basis, your body and brain become dependent on it, as the nicotine bonds with your brain receptors to trigger the release of dopamine, the "feel-good" hormone. Once you stop smoking and are producing less dopamine than your body and mind have become accustomed to, it is normal to react with low moods and depressed feelings.  Lack of nicotine also means losing the "companion" that you thought helped you manage everything from anger to fatigue, which leaves most new ex-smokers feeling empty and adrift for a time. Luckily, for most, the condition is a byproduct of smoking cessation and is temporary.        Some common symptoms of depression that you may experience when you stop smoking include:SleeplessnessSadnessDifficulty concentratingAnxiety or an "empty" feelingFatigueChanges in appetite (eating more or less)Loss of interest in hobbies and activitiesEmotional irritabilityYou may experience one, some, or all of these at one point or another, and to varying degrees.    Coping TechniquesQuitting tobacco is a big change in lifestyle, and you should expect to react, to some degree, both emotionally and physically. You are also at an increased risk of suffering a smoking relapse during periods of depression caused by smoking cessation. It is hard to stay focused and maintain the resolve to not smoke when you're feeling low.   After years of smoking, it is possible that you began to bury your feelings behind a cloud of smoke. Cigarettes are used to deal with everything from anger to sadness to joy, causing smokers to often lean on tobacco to avoid difficult emotions. It is healthy and productive to let those feelings out, even if you feel a little raw from the experience.     For depression that comes with smoking cessation, try some of the following ideas to improve your mood:     Get out of a quick walk. Fresh air is always invigorating, and exercise releases endorphins in the brain, which are known to improve mood.  Set goals, but don't bite off more than you can chew. Divide tasks related to your goals into small chunks that you feel good about accomplishing.  Spend time with people who make you feel good.      When negative/sad thoughts come up about smoking, remind yourself that you miss smoking mostly because it was an addiction, and once you're healed, you won't feel this way.    Create a list of things you can do at a moment's notice when you're feeling the urge to smoke, like do a crossword puzzle or call a supportive friend.      Jolting ourselves out of a negative thought pattern is often as simple as changing what we're doing.    Join a support group. Meeting people who are going through the same struggle as you can help you know you're not alone and offer some much-needed support. The American Lung Association's Freedom From Smoking program has groups all over the country, or do some research to find other support programs in your local area.     While quitting smoking, the body and mind are in a state of transition, and it's not uncommon for new ex-smokers to struggle with their emotions. Don't worry if you are close to tears one moment and angry or sad the next. The balance will return in time.  Change Your Mind, Change Your Life  One of the greatest challenges new ex-smokers face is an important change in perspective. It is that shift in thinking from seeing smoking cessation as an exercise in deprivation to realizing that it is, in fact, one of the best gifts you'll ever give yourself.This is a crucial step in the process of healing from nicotine addiction, and it is with this transformation that many see their quit-related symptoms of depression begin to lift.    Pre-Existing DepressionIf you have been diagnosed and/or treated for depression prior to quitting smoking, it is important to let your doctor know ahead of time that you're planning to quit. Smoking cessation could make you susceptible to additional mood disturbances.    Smoking also causes some medications to be metabolized more quickly, so when you quit, prescriptions you're already taking might need to be adjusted. Your doctor can monitor and correct dosages on any medications you might be on, if necessary.     Always be on alert for drastic mood changes and contact your doctor as soon as possible if anything out of the ordinary occurs. If you're having thoughts of self-harm, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifelineat 800-273-8255.    A Word From VerywellIf the blues have come on since you quit smoking, remember that this is not uncommon. As you are patient through this likely temporary phase, find comfort from your friends, family, and keeping busy with healthier, more productive activities.With time and dedication, these will become the more familiar sources of good feelings, and smoking will become that thing that you thought used to bring you benefit.    You can also take comfort in knowing that millions of people have been through this process successfully before you, and many include it among the most rewarding experiences of their lives.Happier days are ahead, and with them will come a tremendous sense of pride and empowerment from overcoming this addiction.    Article Sources:National Institutes of Mental Health. Depression. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml .Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Boy is that ever me.  Great article.
Myself and many, many others hid emotions behind the veil of smoke.     It is eye opening to have emotions surface and use the opportunity to get very current and  honest with ourselves.  I feel this is one of the many gifts that comes with quitting smoking.               Edited August 30, 2018 by Sazerac
    When i quit smoking i lost what i thought was my best friend. When i would over think i would smoke, on the phone or watching a movie or a sporting event . When i would get angry and when i would wake up, with my coffee and after eating! The biggest time for me was when i was driving that long ride. Some days i would do nothing but i was ok if i had my pack of smokes. So this article sums it up perfectly. PS all i did was replace the cigg with a new best friend one that wouldn't be as toxic or try and kill me... Exercise and a plastic straw(after i got tired of the candy -mostly lollipops)
    So the emotional side of quitting caught me a little off guard. A lot of the things I thought I had dealt with re-surfaced and there was a lot of stuff rearing its ugly head. Still got a ways to go to resolve a lot of it but I think in many was I am emotionally healthier now.
    Great article on what to possibly expect. Not everyone goes through this but most will in varying degrees. I did but it goes away....time heals. Just winning at quitting is a real “upper!” Totally worth it! 
    I compare quitting to emerging from a cocoon. We are enveloped in something, not very pretty, and afterwards we emerge, new, different. This concerns both body and mind. The first weeks after quitting were a chance to observe anxiety and depression as physical, not mental experiences. That was intense but also very helpful on the further road.
Nice article, I read it some months ago when I was preparing. For me, it's about finding balance. I have to stay alert for drastic mood changes on one side,  cause I know very well where they can get me. On the other hand, I try to realise that this proces takes time and also that to blame quitting for every bad mood/state just isn't right. Regardless of quitting, life continues. And life just happens to give me ups and downs and they might have been far worse if I would have been smoking.      I am also starting to realise the importance of the 'it's always there for me' factor.  Obviously I've learn to grow comfort in the idea of cigarettes being 'here for me'.   Though it's only two weeks, I am already a bit embarrased to look at it that way. So many things are here for me... not many of them 'always' and that's ofcourse where the temptation comes in, the temptation to look at cigarettes as if they were comfy, warm, friendly, non-judgemental and above all, ever available. etc. My friends, partner and family are here for me, but not always. So I will have to learn to ask for support in different ways. And even then, if they somehow are uncapable of being there at that moment, I'll have to learn that me reaching out means taking care of myself. My house is here for me, but it doesn't have arms and legs to clean itself, so I'll have to be more concious these days about making it a place where I feel at home and where I feel loved. Literally, the floor is here for me, the earth is there to carry me. Etc.        How I used to hate to be 'thankful on purpose', as a way of therapeutic brainwashing, ha. But more and more I start seeing the beauty in it, even when I don't feel like it yet. Fake it until you make it. Because I do have a lot to be thankful for and when the junky thoughts creep upon me, I want to be able to feel that, to use that so I can disarm the addiction and leave it for what it is: an irreversible, sleeping brainthing that, when left alone, is harmless, faceless and has no identity. Unlike myself!   Edited September 5, 2018 by My life, my recovery

If you start to feel depressed after quitting tobacco and your low mood doesn't pass after a few weeks or gets worse, be sure to check in with your doctor for advice.                   Physical and Psychological Changes                  Nicotine withdrawal is the primary reason for the temporary depression you may experience after quitting smoking. When you use nicotine on a regular basis, your body and brain become dependent on it, as the nicotine bonds with your brain receptors to trigger the release of dopamine, the "feel-good" hormone. Once you stop smoking and are producing less dopamine than your body and mind have become accustomed to, it is normal to react with low moods and depressed feelings.                  Lack of nicotine also means losing the "companion" that you thought helped you manage everything from anger to fatigue, which leaves most new ex-smokers feeling empty and adrift for a time. Luckily, for most, the condition is a byproduct of smoking cessation and is temporary.                                        Some common symptoms of depression that you may experience when you stop smoking include:SleeplessnessSadnessDifficulty concentratingAnxiety or an "empty" feelingFatigueChanges in appetite (eating more or less)Loss of interest in hobbies and activitiesEmotional irritabilityYou may experience one, some, or all of these at one point or another, and to varying degrees.                    Coping TechniquesQuitting tobacco is a big change in lifestyle, and you should expect to react, to some degree, both emotionally and physically. You are also at an increased risk of suffering a smoking relapse during periods of depression caused by smoking cessation. It is hard to stay focused and maintain the resolve to not smoke when you're feeling low.                   After years of smoking, it is possible that you began to bury your feelings behind a cloud of smoke. Cigarettes are used to deal with everything from anger to sadness to joy, causing smokers to often lean on tobacco to avoid difficult emotions. It is healthy and productive to let those feelings out, even if you feel a little raw from the experience.                 For depression that comes with smoking cessation, try some of the following ideas to improve your mood:                 Get out of a quick walk. Fresh air is always invigorating, and exercise releases endorphins in the brain, which are known to improve mood.                  Set goals, but don't bite off more than you can chew. Divide tasks related to your goals into small chunks that you feel good about accomplishing.                  Spend time with people who make you feel good.                  When negative/sad thoughts come up about smoking, remind yourself that you miss smoking mostly because it was an addiction, and once you're healed, you won't feel this way.                    Create a list of things you can do at a moment's notice when you're feeling the urge to smoke, like do a crossword puzzle or call a supportive friend.                  Jolting ourselves out of a negative thought pattern is often as simple as changing what we're doing.                    Join a support group. Meeting people who are going through the same struggle as you can help you know you're not alone and offer some much-needed support. The American Lung Association's Freedom From Smoking program has groups all over the country, or do some research to find other support programs in your local area.                 While quitting smoking, the body and mind are in a state of transition, and it's not uncommon for new ex-smokers to struggle with their emotions. Don't worry if you are close to tears one moment and angry or sad the next. The balance will return in time.                  Change Your Mind, Change Your Life                  One of the greatest challenges new ex-smokers face is an important change in perspective. It is that shift in thinking from seeing smoking cessation as an exercise in deprivation to realizing that it is, in fact, one of the best gifts you'll ever give yourself.This is a crucial step in the process of healing from nicotine addiction, and it is with this transformation that many see their quit-related symptoms of depression begin to lift.                    Pre-Existing DepressionIf you have been diagnosed and/or treated for depression prior to quitting smoking, it is important to let your doctor know ahead of time that you're planning to quit. Smoking cessation could make you susceptible to additional mood disturbances.                    Smoking also causes some medications to be metabolized more quickly, so when you quit, prescriptions you're already taking might need to be adjusted. Your doctor can monitor and correct dosages on any medications you might be on, if necessary.                 Always be on alert for drastic mood changes and contact your doctor as soon as possible if anything out of the ordinary occurs. If you're having thoughts of self-harm, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifelineat 800-273-8255.                    A Word From VerywellIf the blues have come on since you quit smoking, remember that this is not uncommon. As you are patient through this likely temporary phase, find comfort from your friends, family, and keeping busy with healthier, more productive activities.With time and dedication, these will become the more familiar sources of good feelings, and smoking will become that thing that you thought used to bring you benefit.                    You can also take comfort in knowing that millions of people have been through this process successfully before you, and many include it among the most rewarding experiences of their lives.Happier days are ahead, and with them will come a tremendous sense of pride and empowerment from overcoming this addiction.                    Article Sources:National Institutes of Mental Health. Depression. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml .Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This is very true.      A few days ago I thought about my dog that passed over 2 years ago.  I reached for my pack of cigarettes before I even realized I had done it.  They weren't there.     I ended up having to pull my truck over to the side of the road.  I cried for half an hour.     The cigarettes helped me suppress the loss.  Is that a good thing?  I don't know.  Maybe.  The loss of that sweet dog (at 19 - she was tough) almost killed me at the time and I had a hard time holding it together.  But since then I have clearly been hiding from it.  That's why my hand reached out for that pack that wasn't there.      I've also been dragging around a craving for days since then.  And I also think a lot of the depression I have been feeling since quitting isn't about "my friend, the missing cigarettes" but about all of the issues I've repressed in the 20 years I was smoking.        Guess I'll get to cry on the side of the road more.  Joy.       Better than smoking.
@Roark, the emotions you're feeling are completely normal for where you are in your quit. Some of us get angry and others get sad. And yes, it is much better than smoking! You are doing great and just keep reminding yourself that this too shall pass and once it does you'll see just how worth it all this misery was

    Hey Roark! We all used smoking to hide from real life issues in some manner or other.   Don't be sad for your past; be happy for your future because now you're quitting and that's something you can control!  
    I find I can deal with life challenges better now I don't smoke ,I don't have the nicotine withdrawal to cope with on top of everything else ...it does get easier R ...I've just lost my lifelong partner....  And never once thought a smoke would make it better ...it never even entered my mind ...    When i was a smoker ..the least tiny problem i would smoke more ...smoking gets us all wound up ... Take some really good deep breaths ...take in that lovely fresh air ...

Do not let smokey thoughts get any kind of traction in your brain, Roark.   Flush them out and replace them with thoughts of kindness, thoughts of beauty, re-visit a treasured memory  or, 'move a muscle, change a thought'.  These thoughts are junkie thoughts and all about addiction...nothing about YOU.     Your emotions will settle down and you will learn how to care for yourself, how to trust yourself, how to listen to yourself.   Please treat yourself with extra kindness through this time where you may feel very exposed and vulnerable. Bank up the fires of your inner strength and power.  Protect your quit.  You are winning.       You may find this post about Red Flags helpful.

The more you communicate your concerns and experience the easier it is to send things that might help your way. You will also resonate with many, we have our personal quits but, we often are in solidarity over concerns and anxieties involved in all of our quits.      Congratulations on your quit.  Protect it and be really kind to yourself.

    Came across this in the Washington Post.   Apparently vaping has been linked to a lung illness      See article here:  Mystery lung illness linked to vaping         
    I just saw a news article about that on tv. I'm sure there's a lot more yet to be seen illnesses coming from vaping 
    Seen an article from USA Today on this yesterday.  More reports from more than a couple of states coming in on this so now we hopefully get some more action on this.  Is kind of strange that impacts seen are mostly on younger people at this point but at least should create more research!!!!
    Thank you for posting this Wayne ,as I'm in the UK...   I think further down the line ..they will  see just how much damage is done ..  Just as they did with cigarettes....

New article on vaping illness and the numbers are up.  This I truly hope helps towards more research and regulation.  And yes Wayne I agree that numbers could be related to more young people vape.     https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/17/health/vaping-lung-disease-states/index.html                     Edited August 18 by Martian5
    This has been all over our news as well - my son is a vaper and I've been really hard on him about it! I might not be able to play hypocrite with others but I'm no holds bar when it comes to him regarding smoking/vaping. He will get a straight throat punch (out of love) if I see him with one of those darn things in his mouth much less a cigarette. And sadly I see more and more vape shops opening everywhere .      
    Follow up story today in Washington Post:  Vaping related illnesses spike       I’ve  been seeing advertisements for vaping products  on TV from big name cigarette companies now.   Go figure
Quitting smoking...it's what every smoker desires.  We've already established that the act of quitting is dead simple.  You simply refrain from putting cigarettes in your mouth and lighting them on fire.  And repeat. The benefits of quitting are many: freedom, improved health, more money in your pocket, etc.  The benefits do not end there.  In fact, the benefits only begin there.  The process, while simple, is a bold action; a step in the right direction.  You commit to leave the rut of comfort behind to begin a journey of self improvement.  The process can strip you bare emotionally.  It sounds harsh, but has a real upside.  The process will force you to deal with things that have been swept under the rug.  You will have to remove your head from the sand and face the truth.  The process will force you to confront the bullstuff that you have tried to pass off as gospel truth.  The truth will set you free, but it will make you uncomfortable for a while. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  Addiction is a link in a chain, a chain of self-destructive behavior and self-defeating thoughts.  You break that link and the chain that holds you back weakens.  Hold on, that's when life starts to get interesting.  Potential becomes reality.  Confidence begets confidence.  Strength begets strength.  The process, one that begins with a singular purpose and commitment, sets off a series of ripples that will eventually impact every facet of your life. If you sit back and meekly accept that you are a hopeless addict, what else will you simply accept in life?  If you decide you deserve better and boldly commit to the process, what other bold actions to improve your lot in life will you take on? Trust the process.  Embrace the challenge.  Enjoy the ride.
This is a fabulous post.. a great read...as I was reading my thoughts were saying...This was written from a guy who... 1 yr 4 months ago.was smoking I think 3 pkts a day....How wonderful is that..I have happy tears for you.and I'm so proud for you...this .......Is why I stay around...The Quit train will and does take you to freedom...all you need desire to be there...
Fantastic post, Boo!!!  Inspirational and best of all...100% true!
This is a very important message for new quitters or people who are just lurking and thinking about quitting and, it's true! This is not something that you even think about when you first quit. It's probably never been a reason that someone has quit but, it's probably one of the most important benefits to quitting smoking and one that is not realized by many early on in their quit. A good reason to hang in there through the early part of your quit so you too can enjoy these many benefits of being a non smoker.

I'm on that road and I don't look for any exits until I reach destination "Smoke-Free". Others need to follow us and take their lives back!

I was ruminating earlier today, at least that's what I call it when take a brief break to just stare off into space for a little bit.  Got to thinking how eventful the last three years have been.  Things have been happening fast and the next year is looking to hold some big changes personally and professionally.       Not coincidentally, three years ago is when I decided to quit smoking.  There were a few factors at play when I decided to start making some major changes in my life.  However, quitting smoking was the catalyst for change that set off a chain of events that transformed every facet of my life.       Anyhow...I was going to write a post about how the process of quitting can set off a ripple effect in your life.  Then I remembered that I already wrote a post like that.          On 7/20/2017 at 5:30 AM, Boo said:              Quitting smoking...it's what every smoker desires.  We've already established that the act of quitting is dead simple.  You simply refrain from putting cigarettes in your mouth and lighting them on fire.  And repeat.                                        The benefits of quitting are many: freedom, improved health, more money in your pocket, etc.  The benefits do not end there.  In fact, the benefits only begin there.  The process, while simple, is a bold action; a step in the right direction.  You commit to leave the rut of comfort behind to begin a journey of self improvement.  The process can strip you bare emotionally.  It sounds harsh, but has a real upside.  The process will force you to deal with things that have been swept under the rug.  You will have to remove your head from the sand and face the truth.  The process will force you to confront the bullstuff that you have tried to pass off as gospel truth.  The truth will set you free, but it will make you uncomfortable for a while.                                       A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  Addiction is a link in a chain, a chain of self-destructive behavior and self-defeating thoughts.  You break that link and the chain that holds you back weakens.  Hold on, that's when life starts to get interesting.  Potential becomes reality.  Confidence begets confidence.  Strength begets strength.  The process, one that begins with a singular purpose and commitment, sets off a series of ripples that will eventually impact every facet of your life.                                      If you sit back and meekly accept that you are a hopeless addict, what else will you simply accept in life?  If you decide you deserve better and boldly commit to the process, what other bold actions to improve your lot in life will you take on?                                       Trust the process.  Embrace the challenge.  Enjoy the ride.

Quitting smoking didn't transform my marital status for which I am ever gratefully single.  lol.        But, the changes have been quantum none-the-less    and the thing is now, I know how to change.     I have the skills to identify where change is needed and the skills to facilitate change,   I also gained the trust in myself and self-confidence to meet these challenges.     I love seeing this in other quitters, too.  It is remarkable to witness.
I will always remember you all  as part of my support group to stop the cigarettes . I wouldn't have made it without you. Didn't even think i could do it ,but coming up here everyday doing the daily nope and collaborating with people that had the same goals as me pulled me through. It will be 2 years December 12th. I am a firm believer that groups like these really work if   It worked for me. I thank everyone from the bottom of my heart

As one of three young children, I recall one of the most coveted privileges my mother bestowed upon us.  Shortly after my eighth birthday, and right before Christmas the stars had aligned to give me the winter reward all 3 of us children desired.  Of course my older brother who was 12 got to carry out this deed much more often than me or my sister who was 7.  But tonight he was at a hockey practice with my father.   My pregnant mom, sister and I were driving from our suburban home on an 18 mile trip to see the amazing Christmas lights adorning the vast Boston Common. This was one of my fondest annual childhood memories.   Shortly after our journey began my opportunity to participate in the reward came.  “Honey, reach into my pocketbook and grab me a cigarette and light it, would you?”  You see, my mom refused to take her mittens off will driving due to her poor circulation.  In her wisdom, she recognized how dangerous it would be to try to light a cigarette, while driving, with mittens.  It would be much safer to have her 8 year old son light it for her.  I felt like such an adult as I passed her the lit Pall Mall and blew the smoke toward the back seat where my jealous sister stewed.  The only downside to this whole scenario was that my mother would not allow us to crack the window for fresh air.  “Are you crazy?  It’s freezing out!  Roll that back up right this instant!” Looking back on this, I realize that my mother had practically no idea the danger cigarettes posed to one’s health and absolutely no concept of secondhand smoke.  The Surgeon General had issued vague warnings that cigarette smoking may be harmful to your health.  What’s so discouraging now is that we do know the hazards of smoking and nicotine addiction, yet we see predatory companies pushing children’s flavored vape cartridges.  They even have the audacity to put a warning to keep out of reach of children on the side of Cap'n Crunch, Count Chocula, and Trix flavored flavored vape cartridges. So the battle moves from the ignorance of smoking dangers to predatory targeting of children.  No one ever said it would be easy to win this war.  But each individual victory is a step in the right direction.  Keep up the fight and KTQ.                                 Edited August 20 by BKP
I remember one time, I must've been around five or six years old, my Dad was lying on the couch in our living room. I climbed up on top of him and we just lay there on the couch for what seemed like an hour while he blew smoke rings.       It was awesome.     I didn't get to hang out with my old man much when I was a kid, so this was quality time I'll never forget.     What's funny is that I knew my Dad smoked a lot when I was a kid, but I was chatting with my (older) sister just last week and she told me he smoked 4 packs a day and that there was rarely a time when he was awake that he wasn't smoking.       Crazy the things you remember/don't remember from your childhood.Edited August 21 by JimHannoonen
When was the “eureka” moment?  The world wide accepted “eureka” moment that made people stop, collaborate & listen?  I can confirm that through most of the 1970s/ you could smoke on a plane.  Doctors thought it helped asthma.   Cigars to congratulate the birth of your likely nicotine addicted child.        I believe up to a point; people really did not know any better.  I support that generation.         That generation is dying.       The rest know better.  Or should. Or would if affordable rural health was available to those needing it.        I, too, BKP remember those days.  If my dad heard the theory of second hand smoke-  he would have never smoked in the car, on the plane, or in the restaurant with me.  I never lit a smoke- but I picked up the wayward one from the floor board.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/smokers-in-this-state-spend-up-to-23-million-in-their-lifetime-2018-01-17     Smoking costs you more than $27,000 a year. Here’s your no B.S. guide to quitting for good. Published: Jan 9, 2019 1:36 p.m. ET     Billions of dollars is going up in smoke.   Connecticut smokers are coughing up $2,854,614 on their cigarette habits over their lifetimes, according to WalletHub’s “The Real Cost of Smoking by State Report” released on Wednesday. New York, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts and Rhode Island round out the top five most expensive states to light up in, with annual costs topping $50,000, and lifetime costs of more than $2 million. Plus, the estimated 37.8 million Americans who smoke are also costing the U.S. more than $300 billion a year in medical care and lost productivity, according to the CDC.  WalletHub’s report calculated these potential losses by factoring in the annual cost of a cigarette pack per day in each state, as well as the health care expenditures, income losses from lowered productivity and other expenses associated with tobacco products.   ------------------  The article goes into specifics.  Curiously, the cost of smoking over a lifetime equals a very comfortable retirement.
Saving $7 a day in my big mason jar was a big motivator to stay quit.

    Yup! Nothing to lose and everything to gain. Quitting never killed anyone but smoking well ,you KNOW what the end game of doing that is so why not give quitting a try? You will find that you really do have it in you to quit! We are all the same and all of us who are quit were scared to try because of the unknown. How could I possible function as a nonsmoker? What will I do with my time? How can I get through life's stressful situation without smoking. We ALL pondered these questions as I'm sure you will but we are all here to tell you; It IS possible no matter who you are!

You need to register to post and we would love to meet and support you so won't you sign up today?  Quitting is so much more fun on the train ...I swear it's being with these great folks here that helped me solidate my quit ....why do it alone ?   Quitting doesn't have to be doom and gloom ....quite the opposite ...I've had the ride of my life ...   I've not only kicked my killer addiction ...I've had fun doing it ....  Meeting new friends ...what can be better....
    I never thought I would quit and I believed all the lies addiction feeds the addict.        Then, on a whim, I just did it.     Very quickly, I searched for information,   how was I going to feel ?   how long was the withdrawal going to last ? when would the smokey thoughts stop ?       Finding Joel Spitzer at WhyQuit.com and his Daily Quitting Lesson Guide,    I began to understand my nicotine addiction.    For the first ten months of my quit, I lurked here and there    joining to thank everybody for their experiences that helped me so much.    Staying for the camaraderie, the possibility of helping others and continuing my education of nicotine.         That was nearly six years ago and I say to you, 'If I can quit, everybody can quit'
    Jump!       Do it!      Don't waste another minute!
    Everyone on this board has gone through the process of reclaiming their freedom from tobacco.           It's not impossible.        It CAN be done and it's easier with comrades who know perils and pitfalls of addiction.     We are on your side and want to see you succeed.     
C'mon smokers.  It really is not as difficult as you think.     I smoked for 42 years and spent the last 15 years trying different methods to quit; always giving into the addiction.   I became so discouraged.  I knew the dangers of smoking and saw my father-in-law die of lung cancer from smoking.  I was so embarrassed and ashamed that I became a closet smoker.  As a result, I did not want to do much and mostly stayed home and smoked.  I was terrified I would die of a smoking related illness.    One day, I stumbled across the Quittrain forum and started lurking and reading everything I could.  I finally summoned the courage to post and join in the conversations.  Everyone here jumped in and started guiding me.  These strangers seemed as if they had known me my whole life.  Of course they did, because at one time they were like me.  They knew what I needed to hear to muster the courage to quit.  With a little humor and encouragement, they held me up through the difficult weeks and guided me into a smoke free life. Hop on the train and give it a try.  Freedom from nicotine addiction is a wonderful result.
Hi everyone! So I have decided to use my saved money to get a personal trainer a couple of times a week. At almost 55 and 2  herniated disc, type 1 diabetes I don’t know where to start with a safe workout Routine. Since I’m making the decision to get healthy by not smoking I need to also make a plan to get in shape. I know myself and I need to also be  held accountable. Otherwise I will just find a reason not to workout! So what is everyone esle doing with there new found money?
Sounds like you have a good plan.  I have saved my money and at present am having much needed oral surgery and partial dentures (could not afford the implants) made.  One more oral surgery session then getting everything else done -- my saved money basically covers 90% of it (and yes I still have all the savings in my account, it really helps)!!!
    Yes smoking is so bad for your teeth. That’s a great way to spend your $$. I had my teeth fixed years ago. I had poor  enamel.
    Travelling - it's all going there! 
I spent $2,000.00 of it on a new pond filtering system and now my pond is crystal clear  Oh and am spending the rest on once a month housecleaning
I bought several things I needed: new washer and dryer, new desktop computer w 24" monitor, new fitbit and replaced a 60 ft section of fence in yard! I also have someone come in 1x a month to do housecleaning!
Isn’t it nice to share all the things we are doing with our new found money. I  recently paid my car off so now I’m putting that car payment dollar amount in savings each month. Since I got use to not having it.Edited August 3 by Diane R
    I don't know. I have just not had to budget everything around having enough money for smokes.  Fair wack will have gone on the chemist as one of my meds is not PBS listed. I have increased my donations each month. I buy the kid brand name close. Better cuts of meat at the butchers. Occupational therapy for the kids dyslexia (it's experimental so not covered) and her physio for her knee.
    The money I used to spend on cigarettes, is now spent on more food.
    Initially, I used the money saved to build a home gym in the basement of my old house.  Quitting smoking freed up some money to build a home gym.  Building a home gym and working to get in better shape reaffirmed my commitment to stay quit.        It was a perfect circle.
    Boo that’s great way to use your found. Only. I live in Florida no basements here. But I feel the same way I want to start working out too. So personal trainer for now. And perhaps a home gym in the future!

    I need to save it in a mason jar again...it adds up so quickly. My first stash paid for a garden nursery spending spree and broken ankle and leg.   The next stash paid for another broken leg. Maybe, I shouldn't jinx myself...?  I  don't think our superstitious, @notsmokinjo,  would risk it and maybe she is right.      I'll just be more comfortable about treating myself every now and then.
Ah the quit money lol - I need to get my ticker going so it can do all the adding for me! I think in the beginning I will definitely hire a maid service - make things easy on myself and do all the chores I just cant stand!! And now that my BF is jumping on the bandwagon we plan to finish up all those 1/2 finished home improvement jobs we started and never finished lol. I'd really like to have my kitchen re-done and more open. My house is from the 50's so it's definitely time to upgrade!!
    I never decided to put the money aside as such but the money I've saved from not smoking has mostly gone into two things: travelling (continuous) and having my teeth straightened (a few years ago). Both of those are massively big investments in myself that were/are certainly done more easily than if I blew an insane amount of money a year on smoking. 
I am kind of in the same boat as these two. I didn't/don't specifically set aside the cash I would have spent on smoking. Prior to Oct 2017, I was spending only $40 a month on it (RYO cigarettes) So it wasn't significant.   I guess no matter how one spends their previous "cigarette money", it makes buying "needs" more affordable and "wants" a little more guilt free. "I really don't need this but what the heck, at least it is not tobacco". I said that each time I upgraded my already gawdy stereo system. Lead us not into temptation, for that we can easily find on our own.                On 8/3/2019 at 6:06 AM, notsmokinjo said:               I don't know.

When I was 10 (84/85), I wanted this torn up jean jacket they had at the store, it was only $80 and didn't understand why my mom wouldn't spend that much on a torn up jacket.               On 8/4/2019 at 7:12 PM, greenlight said:                I never decided to put the money aside as such but the money I've saved from not smoking has mostly gone into two things: travelling (continuous) and having my teeth straightened (a few years ago).

@JB 883 , welcome back.     PBS is the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme.... Australia has a social health system. The PBS caps the price of listed medications at a maximum $40ish and the government pays the rest. Many medications (chemo meds) are fully covered. Pensioners and concession card holders only pay $6.80 per script...then there are thresholds, if you spend a certain amount of money on meds in a year you go to the pensioner price and if you get to the next level it's free. Some medicines are not on the list, so you pay full price. Ventolin puffers cost $6.90 (pensioner/concession card holders get 2 for 1). One of my medications costs me $50 a fortnight. My kid's biggest clothing expense are her shoes. She is just as happy in a Marvel T as she is in a Dangerfield dress so I'm kind of a bit lucky there..but bras, cost me a fricken fortune, I did offer to get some barbed wire to hod in her cows, she did not see the humour.
I would have to say food - well healthier food at least. And then on those mini impulse trips where you just really need to grab 1 or 2 things from a particular store and end up leaving spending close to $100.00.  I need to start leaving my wallet at home and just take a $20 on those days .
    Great question.  Maybe I should pay more attention to her spending ....
    Cocaine and hookers
    LOL - you beat me to it @Octain
    Lol Joking. I have never purchased a hooker.  Well, not directly but I have been married for a long time. As for the for cocaine. Long time ago.  But like cigarettes, I quit that too.     As for the money saved from smoking,  simple lifestyle improvements.

    Oh my you people are  quite creative with your newfound money lol
    I was going to invite them over with the girls and the blow !

    I've taken to collecting pocket knives.  I've amassed quite a collection over the past couple years.     
Dear QTrain-ers,    I was thinking today about my motivations to quit smoking and to stay quit  and thought I would share them, hoping y'all share your motivations in response.        I consider my resolution to quit was a primary factor but, wealth and health came into play as well.        I quit on a whim, a dare to myself. Unexpectedly, my immediate motivation was an inner strength I found in absolutely committing to the journey.    This really helped me through the bumps, knowing I was clear in my resolve.         In a more mercenary vein, wealth motivated me and if I am honest, it was very important.        Each day, I ceremonially placed a ten dollar bill between the pages of a NOPE book  which filled up quickly and was moved to a mason jar.  Better to see my progress.   In ten days, I had a hundred bucks.     In ten months,  I had Three Thousand  ! I felt like Midas with all that dosh.       As far as health,   I was in ignorant denial and never paid much mind to health risks.  Sure, a minor cold inevitably morphed into bronchitis and I certainly coughed a helluva lot     but, for forty something years, I idiotically accepted that was just the way things were.       I was weeks into my quit before I faced the truth and began to understand the ramifications of smoking and my nicotine addiction.   Facing the damage done, I am tentatively grateful that maybe I quit in time.  I feel great.  Breathing is rapturous, innit !    Now, health is a motivator keeping me nicotine free and I haven't been knocked down with bronchitis in four friggin' years.     Amazing.        The personal empowerment by keeping this commitment to myself has influenced all parts of my life.  I am stronger, braver, more truthful and hopefully have a sincere compassion for others fighting addiction, living with addiction.      All you smoke free creatures here are great inspirations and kick a s s  motivators,  keeping me on the Good Foot.      Tell us, if you will, about your Motivations.       Love,   S    Edited December 21, 2018 by Sazerac
I was sick for a month before I quit - like really sick with bronchitis!! Finally realized I was still smoking even though I could hardly take a breath without initiating a coughing fit. Didn't know if I could make it stick or not but joined a couple of these social media quit smoking sites and educated myself about this addiction. Read stories about other's journeys and that really helped me stay the course through difficult times. 1 year later, here I am. Still quit - still an addict but healthier I expect. My wallet is fatter for sure but that was not a motivating factor for me. I had past many milestones where a pack of smokes hit whatever cost I told myself I would not pay. I had given up on that being a motivational factor for me. - lol.
    Well most of my motivation for quitting is spot on with Sazerac's.  I had been seriously thinking about quitting for a few months and trying to cut down November through December.         I am a disabled veteran and have been treated by the VA medical system for over thirty years and the care has been anywhere from poor to good.  In the last couple of years the VA has been under fire for its treatment of veterans.  The doctors there would always state that I needed to quit but there was no conviction in what they were saying.       A couple of years ago I was assigned new doctor and she has been pretty good and would also state on all appointments I needed a quit.  I saw her in early December and went over this pretty good.  A couple of weeks later some of my tests had come in and her nurse called me.  The nurse said the doctor would do anything to help me quit, the tests were beginning to show some serious negatives.  We had a long discussion over the phone.       After that call I realized that my Doctor and the Nurse truly cared about me and not going through the motions.  I do not know why but this stuck with me, so much so that after the first of this year I quit, just jumped off the cliff cold turkey.  Though the last few weeks there have been difficulties I have not looked back.  To say the least my VA medical team is ecstatic (as well as my grandchildren).      I know you have to make to the choice to quit yours and for yourself but, sometimes somebody really needs to knock you upside the head and show you that your are worth more to yourself.
My motivations to stay quit:    - I was on my way to an oxygen tank. What a ridiculous way to live when I have the power to defeat that possibility. This was my main motivation to quit in the first place: I finally got angry enough about this to do something about it.    - My self esteem is now all entwined with quitting. If I ever gave in now I wouldn't be able to live with myself. The fact that I successfully quit makes me feel good about myself.    - And joyful. Some days I can actually feel joy about my breathing and my discipline and my release from the slavery and my new daily exercise routine, that came about solely from quitting.   - and $1000.00/year money in my pocket ain't too shabby a reason either.        Thanks for the post Sazerac. It's a great reminder and motivator.
What are your motivations ? Making a list of your reasons to quit can be a useful tool in your toolbox. and while I think of it, don't forget to also post a Pre- response to your own SOS, this is so helpful to you and also to the group,  in assists us knowing how to respond to you and helps you to conquer any crisis you may encounter.Edited March 13 by Sazerac
My Motivation, i saw the ending and it's bad. I don't want to go out that way. My lungs and My Health are what motivates meEdited August 4, 2018 by Whispers
After years of failed quits of one sort or another, my motivation to quit was a deep feeling that I had no more time and needed to do it right, and once and for all.   I found QSMB, lurked for a while, got a prescription of Chantix, and made my first post.        Motivation to stay quit--well,... freedom is addictive!  I feel so much better I can't even consider going back. I also believe that the Law of Addiction is 100% accurate.     Jim
Being diagnosed with CAD - coronary artery disease and early stage COPD was motivation enough for me!       February 2017 - Stroke  April 2018 -  CABG x3 (triple Coronary Artery Bypass Graft)          Edited August 4, 2018 by Rozuki
My motivation was my new Dr telling me if I didn't quit smoking I'd be dead in ten to twelve years and on oxygen  My junkie mind even did the math thinking in 10 years I'd be 62 around the age my dad died so it must be my legacy. He was so thrilled to hear I quit and how clear my lungs sound I actually really like him now. So even if I am dead in ten to twelve years at least, hopefully, I won't need oxygen.
I was 55 a year and a half ago getting annual physical. Doc asked me if I was ever going to quit. I said I knew I should or at least cut down, but not anytime soon because I wasn’t ready to. So she said she wanted to send me in for a lung xray to see where I was (baseline thingy) for possible future medical treatment.     That hit me hard; I realized I was playing around with my health, I wasn’t getting any younger and I was heading for a horrible sickly lifestyle in my older years.  I quit a month later using Chantix.
    Reading posts from folks like Tyme today... Drives it home the importance of keep the quit at all costs...this is our lives ,our health..and it's scarey stuff !!
    To stay quit: a big factor is what a waste it would be if I started again after nine months. That I know it wouldn’t be just one. That I see visible benefits from not smoking so why shall I smoke. 
    I have most certainly maintained my Quit since having a bilateral pulmonary embolism. It was diagnosed as “Unprovoked” meaning no cause found with testing. Smoking causes blood to clot faster than normal so I really have to wonder if mine was due to smoking....just no proof. Who in their right mind would smoke after this? 
    Good to see you Tyme....    Smoking causes so many bad illnesses to the body,as smokers we don't even think about...every part of our wonderful bodies are effected.... I too didn't quit until the s*** hit the fan...but I quit.,just like you ..and that something to be proud of...the damage won't go any further..x

    Father died from tobacco related issues.        My quitting was a final gift to his memory.     Later, I realized the gift came back to me as well.      Smoking would desecrate my father's memorial and that ain't happening.  
I didn't want to wheeze anymore I didn't want to stink anymore  I didn't want to waste my money anymore I didn't want to waste my time anymore  I didn't want to be a slave anymore     My Dad smoked 4 packs a day for over 40 years and died at the age of 56. When I realized I was closing in on 50, I had to stop.     I told my girlfriend (and myself) when I quit that I would never smoke again. That's all the motivation I need.Edited August 16 by JimHannoonen
Well my  motivations  Call me nana and grandma. If I didn’t stop I won’t be here for all the  major milestones in their lives. My oldest started 7th grade this year and the youngest just turned a year old last month. Now to  motivate their papa to do the same.
You are well on your way to a life long quit Diane. My wife quit probably 10 years before me. She never really put it in my face but when I was ready myself to quit her example showed me it was possible so her quit had great value to me. Hopefully the same will be true for your hubby and maybe he will see the light before I did?
    He was  supposed to quit with me. He can go all weekend without smoking. He doesn’t smoke around me. His kids really want him to quit. But I know he has to be ready to quit. 
    Keeping hold of my two plates of meat ( feet )....is my motivation....cigs or feet ...the choice is simple really.  Diane...deep down every smoker on the planet wishes they could quit ,whether they admit it or not ...   You are a good role model for your Hubby...when he see,s you have succeeded....who knows what miracles happen .
What?!?!?!      Say again?      Well according to a few studies and some peripheral observations there ARE a few benefits to regularly using tobacco products.      Lower's risk of total knee replacement in men.          Lower's risk of Parkinson's disease.            Lower's risk of obesity.            Lower's risk of unwanted pregnancy..b'cuz you ain't getting any Ashtray-breath.         The Joys of momentary gratification as you feed your habit.         There are suggestions that smoking alleviates ulcerative colitis.           No need to plan for your 80th birthday.         There is some blurriness to this list.  For instance, you may not need total knee replacement because you weigh less because of smoking BUT if you DO need total knee replacement as a smoker your chance's of complications are much, much higher.     In just about every other way smoking increases your risk of acquiring or worsening every other disease or medical complication, for instance (and just to name a few):         Alzheimer's         Dementia            Glaucoma            Macular degeneration            Coronary Heart Disease          Aneurysm            Peripheral vascular disease         Stroke          Heartburn           Peptic ulcers           Vericose Veins          Crohn's disease         Gallstones          Osteoporosis            Asthma          Lower respiratory tract infections          Stained teeth           Premature tooth-loss            Various gum diseases            Premature aging of the skin (your largest organ)            Persistent coughing         Smelly hair         Yellowed fingers            Bronchitis          High cholesterol            Weaker immune system            Infertility (see benefits #4)           Major diabetes complications            Blood clots         Early menopause         COPD            High blood pressure         Decrease in sense of smell          Pregnancy complications         New born complications          An increase of varying degrees of just about every kind of cancer           Renal failure           Increased chance of falling asleep and dying in FIRE.  Yes, this has happened.          Increased chance of complications and lengthened recovery periods of many medical procedures and surgeries          ...and most significant of all...erectile dysfunction (see benefits #4; again).         And these are just the medical disadvantages to smoking.  We won't bother considering the disadvantages related to personal expenses, taxes, social stigmata, or the medical disadvantages of second hand smoke that impacts those YOU ARE CLOSEST TO YOU, or the resale value of that ashtray-on-wheels you call your car or the stench rising from your cloths.Edited August 16 by Siriustweaking
    Incredible list, @Sirius    for so many years, the light was on lung cancer.    Now the light shines on everything. I know it took a lot longer for simple cuts and scrapes to heal when I smoked   not to mention the annual 'bronchitis, which I no longer have and lots of other things on the list. Hopefully, I quit in time but, even if it catches up with me,   I know that I will never, ever smoke again. My quality of life is measurably better than the smokey days.    
I just don't like the idea of smoking any longer. It seemed such and inseparable part of me for decades but now ...... I can't imagine myself with a cigarette in my mouth. That's a good thing but it's not something I expected to feel when I first quit.Edited August 17 by reciprocity

Well hope this comes out ok.  I am well into spending my saved money from quitting.  Most all of you know I am having major dental work and most of the damage was created from smoking.  Anyway had my last oral surgery today -- that was $1100.00 and will include a crown on another tooth.  In 3 weeks I get my impressions for really high quality partial dentures and that will add $3800.00 on top of another 1000 spent for the first oral surgery.  Anyway had some good meds  at the office to get thru and some good meds to get me thru the next three days --- on the down hill roll now and in a month or so will be able to eat somewhat normally and be proud of my smile.  Sure glad I  saved that money, I would like to have travelled some but in the future I can take care of that.   Anyway on the mend and on to a better smile.  No regrets -- I did this to myself and I will get it taken care of now that I have the means and the motivation!!!!!
    Glad you're on the downhill  end of it now martian. We'll be looking forward to seeing that shiny new smile  
    Yay for you, reci!   Enjoy your new smile -- you did the hard work to earn it.  I've spent a fortune on dental fun also.  
They sure know how to charge don,t they! I had some deep cleaning done, as had gum disease which was caused by smoking, luckily the treatment worked, but I still have regular checkups and see a hygienist every 3 months to keep on top of it.    glad it’s all going well for you, and it will be great when you have your new smile. Something to look forward to indeed.All the best
That's great, Martian5!  You just don't realize how damaging smoking is to your teeth (and your arteries, skin, heart, etc.) I go every 4 months for a cleaning now to keep on top of things...after having a lot of "deep cleaning/scaling" to head off periodontal disease....(ouch!). My dentist is impressed at how much my teeth and gums have improved since quitting....so am I!
    I know any visit to the Dental Torture -ist is serious business.    Drink delicious and healing smoothies and sleep as much as you can. Imagine how crazy this would be if you still smoked !   Hope you are back with choppers soon.   s
    I think that's a great investment!! Healthy teeth and gums are just as important to the body as not smoking. Lots of salt water rinses help during the process as well BTDT. You are going to rock that brand new smile!! 
    You’re worth it! Congratulations on this spectacular self care! That’s something to really smile about! 
Great video. Definitely didn't pick up everything but I will be watching again. As far as I get it: There's different types of nicotine receptors, all binding to nicotine but all different properties and all giving off different signals. Some for learning, some for fight or flight response, another one that allows your heart rate to come up. They are widespread through the brain and are  affecting many behaviours. Gives me a clue as to why I unconciously perceived it as a wonderdrug.    Watch, to understand how the different nicotine receptors are hijacked by smoking.  Oh and... tar is not just an unfortunate byproduct of cigarettes, it's actually a feature of the drug delivery device: it carries nicotine to the lungs,  so it can reach the brain rapidly.  Very important aspect of this addiction. Yuck.         Edited October 19, 2018 by MLMR
    Great find MLMR ... this is a brilliant video... @Sazerac will love this if she hasn't seen it.
    Yes, we were having a conversation yesterday and I told her I was still educating myself as much as possible, checking out this lecture and that etc., she was the one to suggest Id post it here because of the educational value. You were right, she loved it     ('Nerdy and good'  )        
But it wasn't too Nerdy... anyone could follow it and breaking it down to science makes it easier to understand the hold it has on us and why it still effects us when its cleared our systems.... understanding that makes beating it so much easier. Strips it of its power. I'm still learning... but I'm better for it. My little old wannabe Irish grandma used to tell me that if I didn't learn one new thing a day I had wasted 24 hours.
Yep, that's also why smokers think they can "tell" a cigerette how they want to "feel" and it gives them the desired effect.     Edited October 19, 2018 by c9jane29
Thanks @MLMR for finding this and posting.  It is a great find !        You are right, @notsmokinjo, it is right up my alley.  Just nerdy enough.    @c9jane29, you brought up a great point I learned in the vid.  I remember well believing the lie , "I'll have a smoke and calm down and have a think"  which only raised my heart rate, messed up circulation and brain function.
    Brilliant video..   Thank you ML for finding and posting...it's always good to see and be reminded of how insidious smoking is ...  And to see something new...well done ...    I remember reading something in Allen Carr the Easy Way.    If pure nicotine was injected in to your body...you would die instantly.... That scarred the crap out of me....

Well I’ve made it to 3 weeks without smoking. I’m quite proud of myself!  There where  Definitely didn’t know if I would make it. I still think like a smoker. I have no idea how long I will. I’m able to tell myself I don’t smoke. It’s not that I’m having a lot of cravings. But still have all the habits. If I let the dog out I still have the oh time for a smoke thought, but I haven’t acted on it. I really thought after a meal would be the hardest and with my coffee but I don’t really what one at either of those times. All and all I’m doing pretty good. I’ve even gone out for happy hour and not smoked. Almost a whole month. I know it’s going to get easier and easier.  I can’t thank quit train enough for making this journey a lot more pleasant than if would have been. So thanks to everyone that was supported me these lasts weeks.
Well done @Diane R!!! I know you have fewer thoughts for a cigarette, but this video may help to get past the thoughts you do have:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLp_ic5VgiI
Ankush I have penalty of thoughts about cigarettes. But I know they would do anything for me. I’m still on the Chantix. If I did lite one now I wouldn’t get anything out of it so no point. But the bigger issue is the habit. I’m so conditioned to smoke. After nearly 40 years of smoking, I have a ton of habit related to smoking. I will stay strong though. I’m not about to let cigarettes run my life any longer. I hope your quit it going well for you. And don’t let anything get in your way!
    That's awesome Diane, congratulations  The constant thoughts of smoking are the worst, it drove me crazy but soon you'll have hours of not thinking about them until one day you realize you hadn't thought of them all day. It's a great feeling and every time you stand up to a trigger that trigger gets weaker and weaker.
    Thanks Jillar! I’m on here all day somedays just hanging around and reading post. I have another website I read too. Get a lot of people asking questions about my quit. It’s all so helpful for me. I’m not working so I have a lot of free time way too much I find now.its amazing when you quit how much time you spent  wasting on cigarettes.
    Three weeks is huge, Diane, and you certainly deserve to be very proud of yourself.  I'm glad you're still enjoying your coffee; that was a saving grace for me.  It sounds as if you are plowing through the worst trigger situations and handling them like a champ.  We are very proud of you, too.
    Congratulations, Diane on Three Weeks of Freedom !      The second a smokey thought comes your way, replace it with deep breaths, your 'mantra', and look at something of beauty.   The sooner you banish these thoughts the better and replacing them with something always available, the better too. It won't be long before you will have conquered every receptor and wrenched it away from nicotine.  It really won't be long even though it might seem like forever right now.  
Diane you are doing great and getting thru the toughest times.   It will slowly get better -- keep up the focus and keep strong.  Congrats on the 3 weeks and you should take a little time to celebrate!!!!
Jordan7 I can’t live without my coffee. And sometime I even make it to Starbucks for a nice latte! Not cheap but still less than a pack of cigarettes.  Sazerac still telling myself I don’t smoke. martian5 I will be having happy hour sometime soon to celebrate my 3 weeks.
@Martian5 's reminder to celebrate is really important ! and remember to reward yourself.   All these things solidify your quit along with your reading and posting.
@Diane R Yup, as ex-smokers, we all were conditioned to smoking at some point. This habit formed due to the addictive nature of Nicotine. Keeping my quit going.
    I’m celebrating everyday. And patting myself on the back as well. It’s not easy to leave what I thought of has my best friend for so many years. But really when you think about it cigarettes  where my tormentor. Like being in an abuse relationship to,some degree. 
    You are doing great Diane.  You have conquered the tough weeks.  
Thanks Linda but I’m not out of woods yet. Today I have been thinking about smoking a lot. Seems to me more today than the last 2 weeks. But I have my gum and other things to put in my mouth. Just a matter of changing more of my habits to fit my new life style.

    Well done !!!!.....nearly one month ...great achievement.....   Having thoughts is OK...as long as you don't act upon it ...    You have a great positive attitude....

    Congratulations @Diane R It seems so surreal that we have come that far without them after all those years of smoking.  Keep up the good work.  IT IS SO WORTH IT!!!
    Good job Diane! You seem to be right on track in this quitting thing.   As others have said, time will work it's magic on getting you settled in and comfortable with your new, nonsmoking lifestyle. We all wish it was a quicker process but considering how long we conditioned ourselves as smokers, it shouldn't come as any surprise that it takes awhile to reprogram our brains. Just keep doing what you're doing and you'll be fine  
    Thanks everyone for all you support and  encouragement.
Good job Diane, 3 weeks is amazing! all that money not spent on self harm!!!! hope you have treated yourself .
Congratulations on making it through the first 3 weeks! Those for me were the toughest. You are right--it will get easier as you keep going!
    How are you feeling, @Diane R? It is great to have you here.  Your posts motivate and inspire people.   Nearing your first month !  What are you experiencing ?  Any issues with Chantix ?   
    Sazerac sorry been Silent today. Had some medical stuff going on. Still not smoking. I haven’t had any problems with the Chantix. I’m still coughing up stuff. I’m not having any cravings at the moment. I haven’t really thought much about smoking the last few days. I’m sure they will come up for time to time. But for now the are nonexistent. So I’m just enjoying that peace for the moment and not questioning it. 
    Right, I knew you were having a procedure.  Hope that went well.    Glad the Chantix is treating you right. As for the coughing up stuff,  your cilia is shedding a lot of gunk from your lungs.    This is temporary, just your lungs cleaning themselves. Of course, if you have worries consult your MD. You are doing GREAT.  Stay focused and remain vigilant.     YOU QUIT SMOKING !!

    If you are astute or lucky to live long enough, you know,   you have to do some work on yourself during this journey.   I know many of us have thought we have a free ride, we can just do what we do and get by, no problem.   Conquering my addiction reminded me that we can help ourselves to be better humans.     We can be better to ourselves.      We can have more compassion for others, especially addicts. We can examine why we are an addict and why we choose to put our addiction to sleep.    We can discover how to change.      This discovery,     'how to change'  is probably the most important life lesson I have learned in quitting smoking.     What have you discovered in yourself ?
    Agree on all.       I wasn't as weak as i thought . I can just say NO and STOP. Understanding why i was smoking and it was quite foolish
Its still pretty early for me but it has been an event packed time. I have learnt that sometimes I need to put me first.    I have learnt who my real friends are and saddky some of hem aren't the people I have known for 30 years.   I have learnt that I can do amazing things without a crutch to prop me up.  I have learnt that being me is enough, and if its not enough for you that's not really my problem. The sane goes if its too much.
    Never to trust the first post on a new page of chicks v sticks! 
    That you CAN overcome stupidity..
    All of the above and a bag of chips!
It taught me this most of all -     The smoking cessation things they try to sell (most notably vape) are sold by BS'ing people. Here is how i know that -      So Oct 2nd i was going to quit cold turkey. I didn't have cash for all that BS like pills, gum, patches, whatever. I failed. Oct 6th I tried again. I have been successful since then.  But...  When i started reading into a lot of things about "Quit", I kept reading about how people try to quit but fail. Of course they had this miracle snake oil they would sell to help people quit. Because you know, cold turkey doesn't work in most cases. At least according to those trying to sell you something. My thought was, "But i managed to quit cold turkey. Took a couple tries but i got it. I didn't even have to open my purse either..."     So yeah it kind of reinforced what I already knew - For anything you want to do, there are companies saying "You can't do it on your own, but we can sell you something that makes it possible".        Plus i learned how nice it is to go through the day without worrying when I will get to smoke again. Like I take my breaks at work and the thought of stepping out for a cancer stick never crosses my mind. No, instead i think, "Ahh, time for a cup of hot chocolate!"       Shut up, i am addicted to caffeine.
    The one all-encompassing thing I learned during the quitting process was the ability to recognize self-defeating thoughts and stop getting in my own way.  For years I hid behind the line of thought that "I'm a smoker, that's my lot in life."  I had resigned myself to living and eventually dying a smoker.  Eventually I got sick and tired of being chained to a pack of smokes and decided to do whatever was necessary to quit.  Did something that I had previously built up to be impossible...started looking around a bit and decided to seek out other challenges.       Once I quit looking into the mirror and seeing my biggest obstacle to success staring back at me, the ripple effect kicked in.  I've reaped far more from quitting than I ever imagined when I ashed out that last cigarette.
    That the skin color between my index and middle fingers is not naturally yellow/brown.   
    It taught me that I must have stunk pretty bad because my dog "Duncan the donut hound" would sit on the floor and sleep in his dog bed,now he's  like a high school boy with a new girl friend.I can't keep him off me.Ah I don't mind he's a cool dog

    I learned that I could be proud of the aches and pains in my body from running because ... they're only possible due to no longer being out of breath or wheezing/dying while trying to run.     
Here is one, it is about money -        I wasted $160 in two months on smoking, going through 3 packs a week.   I thought, "$160 could have gone to something more fun or useful".      For me, when I would spend that kind of money on any other luxury/useless things, I would feel strange but when I bought smokes, it was somehow easier to justify. Maybe cause "Oh only about $6 here and there". But then it adds up and is like, "Whoa, THAT was dumb".       So I learned the nicobitch steals slowly so you don't notice til it is in the three figures in weeks. Even if one spends that money on other useless things, it isn't going to kill you.
That even though you are no longer physically addicted to nicotine  the mental side can creep up and still raise it`s ugly head. Happened to me today. The stupid thought that I could have just one and it would not hurt. I did not have one because I know I am a lifetime addict to nicotine. Almost 3 years and you still have the fight. Not nearly as tough as it was but the thought does not completely go away. Perhaps it will someday but regardless the fight is worth it.

It is a good one.

    Hi all, as the title shows, I need advice on what to do when people undermine my quit. This happens every damn day and every time my quit is undermined, I get a crave for a cigarette, and I also go into a furious rage. I have worked hard to keep my quit going, and its very distressing that my quit is undermined on a daily basis. What should I do? Btw, still staying quit, not taken a single puff since the day I quit smoking. The last few days have been terrible. Thanks...
Hey there Ankush, in what way are people undermining your quit? Do they literally and deliberately say, 'go smoke!' Or, 'you are better off smoking anyway!' ... Something like that? Or is it more in a subtle way and sometimes maybe without intention? And that its your addicted brain that interprets it as undermining, while in reality no one can be blamed, not even your brain because it does what its supposed to do?      Either way, you seem to deal with it the right way. By not lightening up and learning yourself to deal with irritating situations in a different way.       A brilliant person here once told me to always carry glitter. When annoyed by someone... throw that stuff in the air and walk off, chin up! (And tits, if you have 'm).      Edited July 24 by MLMR
    Not sure how people are "undermining you quit" but if you find that whatever they are saying to you upsets you, log on here. You know there's a ton  of people here of the same mindset as you and all of us have nothing but the utmost of respect for ALL quitters. You can always get your mental batteries recharged here.  Are these people X-smokers? If not, they don't know sh*t so just ignore them.
    Ignore them. Smile.Come here. And continue to kick-ass !        
@MLMR No they're not telling me to go smoke, although on one occasion (I think a week and a half ago), I confessed to my mom that I was tempted to go by a cigarette, and all she could tell me was that I have a sick mind and should just go back to smoking. When I quit smoking, I had specifically told her not tell me such things if at some point I got so distressed and told her that I wanted to smoke, but she said it to me anyways. @reciprocity Its the wrong done to me that upsets me. I don't know if they are ex-smokers or current smokers or never smokers (mom is definitely a never smoker though).@Eight-Toe Joe Your advice made me smile. Thank you Edited July 24 by Ankush
    Ankush, sounds like your mom most likely always does a number on your self esteem.  She is definitely not a loving, supportive parent.  You are not quitting smoking for her or any of these other people who are undermining you.  You are quitting for you.   I can tell you that, when I quit, I was taking care of two very unloving parents, who could do a real job on my self esteem.  Due to their age and health, I was going out of my way to accommodate them.  I allowed them to use me and emotionally abuse me.  During my quit journey, I finally realized the strong person I was.  I take care of me first and I do not let them control me anymore.   What your are doing right now is outstanding.  You are quitting an addiction, which is not an easy feat.  Be proud of yourself and do not let anyone undermine that. Everyday you avoid those cigarettes you are gaining so much power and control over you life.  You will find that those people will no longer be able to control your feelings.

The more I fight back and prevent my mom and anybody else from controlling my life and effing up my confidence and self-esteem, the more they try it. It can be really annoying. Always encroaching on my time and violating boundaries I set. I try my best not to let this happen (the encroaching on my time and violating my boundaries), but it still does.
    Sweetie, only you can let them to do that.  With my family, it was their way or the highway.  If I tried to stand up for myself, they would cut me off.  I spent my lifetime trying to prove what a wonderful person I was.  That was a lot of wasted time because they were not going to change.  If setting boundaries means the loss of them in your life, then that is best for you.  You deserved to be loved and respected.  
@Linda Thomas But I don't let them do that, I don't let them do that by fighting back and they do it more and more (like little immature children, one would think they had common sense to behave their age) and then I fight back more and I'm stuck in a circle. Somehow, in their eyes, I always come out the a***ole. I'm not perfect and I've done some things I regret, but I'm not a completely bad person. I know there is a good side to me. I do not want to lose anymore people from my life, I've already lost all my friends and most family members (which I never wanted, but was forced to cut off from them). The only people I now have in my life are my immediate family (mom, dad, brother and sister, 3 dogs), I cannot afford to lose them too, it would be too painful. My family has pretty much set that condition on my life too, its their way or the highway, considering that I've been wronged in so many ways, I'm not going to do things their way ever, so its the highway, and continuing to live under the same roofs nevertheless.Edited July 24 by Ankush
This video may help answer your question            Listen to @Linda Thomas, she has this experience with her parents.  I am so sorry you are going through this too.   Please, continue to believe in yourself.    You do not deserve to be abused.    Remove yourself as much as possible from their sphere,  you can have a free life, a peaceful life, an enriched life.    I know I found people outside my family for support and appropriate love and care   when my family gave me short shrift.  Now my support network is worldwide ! Take good care of yourself and your quit.   You are winning and your self confidence and trust in yourself will continue to flourish.Edited July 24 by Sazerac
@Sazerac but they're my family, I cannot just remove them. While severely lacking in emotional and moral support, they have given me support (financially) in other ways as normal families would. I've tried so much to be independent of them financially, so that I could stand on my own two feet, do what I wanted to with my life and support them (family) back. My parents are after all in their 60s. I thought I had my emotional and moral support (through friends and other family members) and just good times, outside my immediate family, but it turned out they were just in cahoots with my family as well. I wish I had that self-confidence, it comes and goes.        Thank you for your replies one and all. I have often thought, I'll just have one cigarette and be done with smoking forever to calm my nerves, but I know that's not a good way of thinking, and that's only going to lead to the same 3 - 4 cigarettes a day, which I don't want. So, rest assured, as much as smoking monster tries to get me back, I won't let it.

You're still pretty new in your quit and there you are welcoming every newbie, looking out for everyone else, sharing your thoughts, support, opponions in an open and courteous way. You my friend, are a bloody good egg.  You have immense value. You deserve respect because you certainly show it.         Now, when we give up smoking some of us don't have to just deal with cravings. Some of us get to face all those insecurities and hurts we have had programmed into us since we were kids. Why, because while we smoked we programmed part of our brain to think that smoking made it all feel better...our brains learnt that when we felt worthless and useless (usually by the people who shouldn't make us feel that way) we'd have a smoke, when your mum would make you feel like shit you'd go have a smoke...so of course those are the buttons our addiction will push in its dying efforts to get you to throw away your quit. You should be proud of yourself for staying true, this is a hard stage, I've been there and it passes.      So, on to the family dynamic, especially your mum, here is a thought that helps me cope at times, how sad and miserable must their lives be that they need to get their own happiness by causing someone else's sadness. That is truely sad. People who need to make others feel worthless to make themselves feel superior deserve our pity.       You are very much wanted, you are very much worthwhile, and warts and all (even though you keep saying you have them I amyet to see evidence of) we know you are more than just a person with some good. There is a shit load of good in you.       We all have things in our pasts we regret, but it's in the past, you can't change it, you can't undo it....all you can go is move forward and try not to repeat it.Edited July 24 by notsmokinjo
@notsmokinjo Thank you for your kind thoughts. Just one question though, when you say "warts", do you literally mean warts or do you mean "having a negative side", not sure.
I'm sorry you're dealing with this Ankush. This early in your quit everything is amplified. Hopefully as you progress you will find yourself like Linda did and start to realise your self worth. Hugs to you kiddo, xoxoEdited July 24 by jillar
    Thank you @jillar, thank you very much 
    Hold tight to your quit, Ankush. This is paramount. You are doing great !       Stay vigilant and keep doubts about smoking away.   You are still in the early stages of your quit and must protect it fiercely.    Remember Cristóbal's, YOUR QUIT & YOUR LIFE - THE PROPER SEQUENCE       You will get stronger and stronger, you must believe us.    As time goes by, your self confidence and self esteem will bring goodness into your life.    
Thank you @Sazerac but I already think I'm strong enough, and I don't think I need to be any stronger. Its not easy. When I was young (a teenager and even in my early 20s) my mom used to always tell me "You're not strong, you're not strong, you're weak", so while I know you mean well, please don't tell me I need to be stronger. I'm 38 now and still I hear that "Be stronger". How long must I wait till my life becomes better and I live it on my own terms with no hindrance whatsoever and how much stronger am I supposed to be. I'm also on psychiatric medication, all psychiatrists I've across only want to pump my brain with useless medication. I'm trying to cut down on psychiatric medication as well. I do not even trust my psychiatrists. I'm mentally tired. I've tried so many times to live life on my own terms and on so many occasions to improve my life, it sucks not having any income from the past 2 and a half+ years as well. Although, it has been difficult with so much going on, to accurately define for myself what my terms of my life should be. I have however, reached a list of my terms. But yes, thank you for that link. Its helpful.Edited July 24 by Ankush

@Sazerac OK, thank you for the clarification...
You have no responsibility to take anyone else's opinion to heart...even family members.        Let 'em call you weak, just remember that you are strong.       Be relentless with the commitment you have made to yourself and you will be immune from external criticism.         10 hours ago, Ankush said:               Btw, still staying quit, not taken a single puff since the day I quit smoking.             Good job Ankush.  Onward and upward.
    Aww I'm sorry your dealing with all this ...it's a shame ...I tell my kids how wonderful they are every day !!! But look how strong you are ...your fighting this horrible addiction with every thing you've got ...    I say that something to be very proud of... You will get all the support you need ...right here ...

It's just a figure of speech...like having a negative side not actual warts.... But even that seems a little harsh....basically it means we like you just the way you are.  I didn't  mean you have negatives ....

    Oh mate...trust me it gets better...when we quit it can play havoc with medications, especially mental health ones. Quitting can also effect how our endocrine system works, which often effects our mental health too. I'm only a few years older than you and I know I still deal with issues caused by my mum and her words and actions. I know at the moment you don't trust your psychiatrist and you want to be off the meds, I get it, I really do, but please remember that many people need to have their medications changed when they quit. It plays that much with how our body and mind works. Please don't just stop your meds. You have a whole train of people here who think Ankush is a pretty top bloke. Stay safe my friend.
     
Ok story time:  Last week, and i have been quit a while now.... Mum: Aren't you going out for a smoke.  Me: *deep breath and sigh.* My kid: Grandma you know mum doesn't smoke anymore. Mum: and you should know it won't last she will fail at that. Your mum is useless. Besides she was much nicer when she smoked and she is getting fatter she should smoke.       Did I loose my shit: NOPE   Did I storm out: NOPE   Did I cry: NOPE....well maybe a little bit on the inside.   Did the little girl in me who still wants this woman to just accept me as I am want to go and have a smoke...hell to the NOPE!!!        So your original post you asked for suggestions of what to do... this is what I did.... 1. I rolled my eyes (which triggered a whole rant to the kid about how rude her mum is and she shouldn't be like that) .... Don't do that...don't roll ya eyes, well maybe but only if noone nasty can see. 2. I took a big, deep breath in and out.    3. I counted to 10 in English, Italian,  French and Japanese in my my head  4. I reminded myself that there is something fundamentally wrong with the woman, that is not my fault but because I am such a strong, amazing person she uses me to try and make herself feel better.   5. I said nothing and went back to the conversation with everyone else there as if nothing was said....this gave her fire no oxygen to burn.        Sure it hurts but the options are cut her out and loose my family because I know who's side they will fall on or pity her, which takes away a lot of the hurt...how can someone worthy of your pity hurt you.                        Edited July 24 by notsmokinjo

@Boo Thank you very much, I will keep marching forward
@notsmokinjo Thank you for the replies. Mental health medication is terrible, 10 years on them, and I hate it. They come with their own side effects and can play havoc with physical well being. I have a problem with insomnia and disturbed sleep wake cycles, the latter has been sorted out thankfully. Insomnia, not so much. As far as my mom goes, to be fair, sometimes she does tell me don't smoke (when I'm upset), at other times she tells me I have a sick mind and demeans me. That's how she plays with my head, she doesn't realize it which is all the more annoying. I've told her I'm her son and to treat me like that, I've gone as far as being extremely blunt and saying I'm not her b***h. Smoking isn't the only thing she picks on, its several things on a day to day basis and this has been going on for several years, always asking questions indirectly, speaking for me and assuming my silence as agreeing with what she said, trying to put words in my mouth, and even manipulating me into thinking I had said something when I didn't and making me look like a crazy person. The worst part is even other members of the family have done this, and friends have too, and so many unknown morons where I come from have as well. I get mad, and she says I have no control over my temper and I need medicine, and has put me on it for 10+ years now.@Doreensfree Thank you for your support@Sazerac Thank you for the videoEdited July 25 by Ankush
No matter what one does or wants to do, good or bad, SOMEone will undermine it. Even if it is just something you take pride in, someone will want to put it down.   Maybe "Oh you cannot/will not" or there are the one-ups men. Like if you are good at a sport but they know someone who is 10 times better at it.        Now I almost hate to give this advice but if you do relapse, start asking those same people for cigarettes or money to buy packs. I promise they will then encourage you to quit or stay quit.  Shoot, maybe ask for cigarette money even if you do not relapse (but spend the money wisely like ebay stuff). They will stop undermining your quit.     EDIT - hey I forgot,  - The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person who is doing it.  So ankush, next time they start flapping their lip, just say, "Hang on, I am on my not-smoking break"            Edited August 9 by JB 883

Yesterday I went fishing with a friend of mine who I hadn't seen in a few years. We used to go fishing pretty often until life got in the way. I knew he was a smoker of both cigarettes and pot (he LOVES his pot!!). Last time we were together I was a smoker too (cigarettes primarily). I was curious to see if he would say anything to me about why I wasn't smoking. Hey! We're stuck together in a 12 foot aluminum boat 8 km's (5 miles) out on Lake Erie for 6 hours so talk is gonna happen when we're not reeling in a fish! So he says nothing to me about why I was no longer smoking. I watch him going about 1 to 1 on the joints and cigarettes. I didn't say anything to him about his smoking but did notice him coughing and hacking, more when he was smoking the pot than when he was smoking cigarettes but still ..... there was clearly a lung issue going on there.      This guy is probably mid-40's, overweight and still a heavy smoker when you combine both the cigs and the pot.          I'm just wondering what others might do in a similar situation? Start a conversation about smoking in general or just remain silent unless the other person brings up the subject? I don't want to be one of those reformed smokers who pesters people about smoking but I also don't like seeing friends going down a path I know only leads to a bad place.       What do think you would have done in the same circumstances? The reason I ask now is we will probably be going fishing again this year before the lakes freeze over. I will therefore have another opportunity to either do nothing or maybe say something?     Oh yeah! We caught 5 decent size Walleye yesterday. They are a nice eating fish for those who don't know what a Walleye is. Moist, tender, non-fishy tasting white meat fish.
    I managed to piss off some people early in my quit (mostly family members that continue to smoke). I couldn't hold back stating "God, you stink!" Oops.... 
    I don't tend to discuss other people's smoking. They already know full well what the dangers are and that they are addicted. And my god I hated anyone lecturing me when I still smoked, I was fully aware of everything it was doing to me. After all, I am yet to meet anyone who would have quit just because someone told them to, it has to be because they want to quit. I have, however, given a few pep talks when people have shown interest in quitting - this is where I feel I can actually offer something. Usually in my case smokers have asked me about how I quit and the conversation has gone on from there. So personally, I would wait until he expresses even a little interest in your quit/quitting himself - I'm pretty sure he already knows what it's doing to him. 
    I would not say anything.  I never wanted anyone to notice my smoking.  If he did ask about my quit then I would guide him to this forum and encourage him.
I love Walleye.  I don't know if I would bring up the conversation alone with a smoker in a boat in the middle of lake Erie.  Lol.      I talk to my friends about smoking, they ask me questions also. This is pretty casual.  The don't smoke around me, that's a rule.   Mostly,  they cannot believe that I quit.       I talk to strangers about it sometimes.  Not everybody, not the same person twice (unless they ask me). This happens at local bars or music clubs.  Maybe 1 or 2 people every few months.  I try to suss them out, see if they might be receptive.  I don't admonish.       My rap is:  'you know,  I was a heavy smoker for 40 something years and quit cold turkey..(now almost 6) years ago. I just want you to know that it isn't impossible, anyone can do it. It has to do with understanding nicotine addiction and making a commitment to yourself. That's all. I am still active on a stop smoking website, it is a great place for education and camaraderie and there are many success stories'  Here is the address....Quittrain.com'       Sometimes people come over and want to know more.  Mostly they don't.  Some thank me.   I am very low key about it except for my exuberance about being quit, can't hide that.      I would like some QTrain cards.     It would be great to have a barcode on it so people could just take a snap on their phone and get here instantly.   Maybe @MarylandQuitter would be into this or one of our geeks could put it together.
    I wouldn't say anything either until I was asked for the same reasons stated above. Congrats on the successful fishing too

    Yes - it's the QR code you're referring to: I'm not techie either but once you have produced a QR code you can either download an app to read it or if your have an IPhone, I believe there's a built-in reader. You could convey the same info. by handing over a piece of paper with the QTrain website hhtp on it but using the QR code would be way cooler, depending on the demographics of who you are dealing with  
    yes @reciprocity that is exactly what I am talking about.   Way cooler that quittrain.com scrawled on a bev nap.  A card with the logo, the address and the QR code would be really great.      Here is something from our friend, Joel Spitzer, about Helping Others Quit

I'm not sure I really understood the personal implications of smoking when I was a smoker. Oh sure, I knew all the statistics and had heard all the horror stories of what smoking had done to people but I was completely in denial I think. Not me - I'm special! Maybe - just maybe if someone I respected talked to me in a caring way about what their experience had been, before and after, then maybe I would have at least given it some thought? I agree, that talk would not have made me quit but start the thought process maybe?        Maybe the approach next time is; "Hey Tom! Did you realize I quit smoking?" Then just see what the response is?     Anyway, good food for thought.

@Sazerac, that's a great idea but the logistics of sending cards worldwide is an issue. It might have to be just a digital message that people can download to either their phone or to their printer to print out hard copies. I don't know how critical image sharpness for the QR codes is for reproduction on say an ink-jet printer.
Here's a link. Maybe this will help?https://uqr.me/qr-code-generator/blog/best-qr-code-readers/Edited August 5 by reciprocity
    I have to agree with Greenlight.  I really would get peeved if others went on about my smoking (I was in the mode of "it's my life if I want to die early I will).  So I don't really talk to others about quitting unless I am asked -- then I really go all in on the benefits I have had with quitting (focusing on what quitting did for me not for them).  Usually if someone is contemplating quitting they have asked me about the ins and outs of quitting I will try and give them some encouragement and resources.  This can be a tricky subject with some but you have to make sure the other person might be seriously thinking about quitting if not they may have to learn on their own which most quitters have done.  Great question!!!! 
I guess the reason I asked the question in the first place is what is embodied in your statement @Martian5: "they may have to learn on their own which most quitters have done".        Yes, I eventually woke up eventually too but now wish I had years earlier. I guess it's in most of us to want to help others we care about with a wake-up call. That's why this is a tough one to give a "correct" answer to that will apply to the majority of people.     I really do think this guy is heading down a road to somewhere I don't want to see him go & I just believe he will eventually regret not waking up sooner
    I have a bit of a dilemma with a friend of mine as well.  I've mentioned him here before.  He has been "planning" on quitting for over two years now.  Regardless of how much information he gathers, there is always a "reason" (excuse) for why he can't quit right now.  He is also looking for that perfect time to quit when there is no possibility of encountering any of life's stresses during the first weeks of his quit.  I suggested that he find a nice monastery on a mountaintop in Nepal and live there for a few months.  He said I was being a smart-ass.        On the one hand, I want to help this guy and he has asked for my advice.  On the other hand, I feel like I'm beating my head against the wall answering the same questions to no avail.  And I've come to the conclusion that he is not looking for actual answers, he is hoping that I will eventually change my answer and give him the confirmation bias he desires.  That's not gonna happen.       Quitting smoking is simple.  Convincing others to make better decisions is damn near impossible.
If you did a poll of our members I'm betting you will find that 90% of them or more had someone tell them they should quit years before they actually decided to quit. I hated when people told me and I promised myself I wouldn't be that kind of ex smoker. I do however love to give advice to anyone who says they are thinking of quitting or trying to quit.
    I tried everything ...to get my best buddy to quit ...all I did was annoy her ...   They have to want to do it for themselves...pity the cigs caught up with my friend before that happened ..
    I wait to be asked.. usually someone will ask if I have a spare durry and I will say, nope I quit ##ago...which either leads to questions, nothing or "bullshit"...to which i say, "yeah-NAH one-a the best things I ever did" (kinda hard to top the kid)....which either leads to questions or nothing...I get where ya coming from @reciprocity, I've got a couple of mates/relos who I wish would quit but my nagging ain't going to help.
    All of my family and most of my friends are still smokers, but I try not to do the ex smoker speech, but if they ask I will chat about it and tell them how much better I feel etc. Most people still cant believe I managed to stop in the first place as I was a full on smoker, first thing in the morning, every opportunity during the day, driving to and from jobs, even if I woke up in the night for any reason . I think you have to worry about your own not smoking fight and let others do it when they decide they are ready, and you can offer your support and advice then.Most of us don't respond too well to being told what to do or not do. Has anyone else noticed when you are around smokers who know you have given up, they always tell you they have cut down a lot recently!
Not sure what I would say. There have been periods in my life when I used to smoke pot and cigarettes too. Before I became a smoker, as far as I remember, I never told any of my friends (who were smokers) to quit. It was their choice, and I used to think when they are ready to quit they will. I can't force my advice on anybody. I can just give it but in the end its their choice whether they want to take my advice or not. After I became a smoker, as far as I remember, there were a couple of friends who I used to once in a way talk about quitting smoking (one I knew for more than 10 years and the other a social smoker, I knew for around 3+ years). The guy I knew for more than 10 years, used to quit smoking then start then quit and so on. When he used to quit smoking, he used to keep a small pouch of tobacco (with filter) in his mouth to get his fix of Nicotine. I had told him that it can lead to mouth cancer, and was no different than smoking. Anyway, I never advised him to quit, we used to discuss quitting, he did quit off and on, I didn't for a long time (until this year). I am not in contact with this friend from 2 years now, so I don't know if he still smokes or not. As far as the social smoker friend goes, he had told me several times to quit smoking or to at least reduce smoking drastically (I used to cough a lot and used to take cough syrup everyday). I am not in contact with this friend either from the past 2 years. So again, I don't know if he has quit smoking altogether or not as well. Some other friends who I knew from college (graduation days) used to smoke. I don't know if any of them smoke now (not in touch with any of them from 2 years as well. I would probably advise them to cut down if I saw them coughing a lot the way I used to cough, but quitting is entirely their choice. Mostly, in the end, I think I would keep my mouth shut, because again its their choice whether to quit or not and I don't want to come across as imposing my advise on them.
    Guess it's best to keep my yap shut and wait until he inquires about it, if he does. Probably nothing to be gained by me initiating the conversation as I do agree that people have to want it for themselves and you can't provide them with that desire by preaching to them.
    There's not much point in preaching the good word to those who don't want to see the light.  Those spreading the message will find it to be an exercise in futility.  While those cigarette smoking heathens will only consider you to be a pain in the ass.  Lecturing an addict who has no will to change is like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall; you can work at it all day and never accomplish anything.        That being said: Don't hesitate to celebrate your quit.  Don't hide your pride.  Don't muzzle your truth.  When you make positive changes in your life, there are going to be some "nattering nabobs of negativism" that will try to rain on your parade.  Don't let 'em.  You've done one of the best things for yourself you will ever do; shout it from the rooftops if you are so inclined.     As for those who are uncomfortable with your success, that's their problem not yours.
    I don't have a single friend that smokes, so I don't really have anyone to lecture.     That said, if I was in your situation, I would say something. Probably something along the lines of "Dude, you sound like sh*t. Have you considered quitting smoking?" and see where it goes from there. If he was interested, I'd turn into a preacher. If he wasn't, I'd say "You're funeral,. dude" and carry on fishing.

As a new quitter, I wanted to tell everyone that could quit too, that they didn't need to be tied to the habit.  If I could do it, they certainly could.        Now, I'll only talk to someone if they ask me for input.        Over the last couple of years, I've talked to a few people who asked me and my success rate is 0.  Only 1 person has quit a few times going a few months last time but think he's smoking again now.
    I suppose our perspective changes (a lot) once we are successful quitters and we want to "save the smoking world" but to no avail  Makes sense actually because that unwavering commitment that comes from deep down inside all quitters is something you can't persuade someone to gather. they gotta do that themselves.

Probably something along the lines of "Dude, you sound like sh*t. Have you considered quitting smoking?" and see where it goes from there. If he was interested, I'd turn into a preacher. If he wasn't, I'd say "You're funeral,. dude" and carry on fishing.                                So if he were semi-interested, would you turn into the preacher for his funeral?
Hi there!       I'd like to set up this thread as a milestone or challenge thread that new quitters can post to day to track their progress.    Its also a great way for people to acknowledge their progress... I like the daily Nope pledge, but it doesn't have any context or sense of progression. Its hard to reply to each person simply typing 'Nope'....       Hopefully threads like this will be ways to keep encouraging and celebrating and helping relapsers to keep pushing. Rather than super long threads about why my quit is failing lets just get through each day - treat this like a long long race and keep pushing forward?     While I think the Celebrations thread is awesome, it feels a bit daunting for a Day 1 quitter to read about someone reaching 1 year or 5 years. That's Mount Everest for us and can lead to a sense of disillusionment - but it is also inspirational no doubt! We need a way to group people together at the same stage of their quit.     Once I have reached Day 7 I will open a 14 day challenge thread.    if I/we relapse then reset your counter and keep posting to this thread until you reach 7 days!! and PLAN to NEVER COME BACK to the 7 day challenge Thanks, Matt BEdited August 1 by Matt B

    Hey Matt, just dropping in to say good idea and welcome. Nice to have another Aussie onboard, even if he is from Sydney...at least it's not Adelaide 
Thanks mate for touching base! Where are all the new quitters lol? Hopefully I’ll have a few buddies to help me in my progress. Previous best was 8 months with a couple of 3 month stints also. So I know I can do this. But so much easier when I’m not talking to myself  I have a phone app with chat but no threads so it has no sense of progress. Just on demand talking and encouragement etcEdited August 1 by Matt B
My quit date is 27th July, 2019 @Matt B. My previous quit date was 2nd April this year, but I blew it with one cigarette last week. So starting over. Your plan to keep quits going is good, and I'll go with it. I will, however, still take the daily Nope pledge, as it has helped me a lot. Also, welcome aboard!!!
Hi Ankush!      Im soo glad someone else is with me here!   Sure I’ll also do the daily nope - it’s very powerful.  So you are on day 4 or 5?   Just post every day which day you are on. When you get to day 7 I’ll open the 14 day thread.Edited August 1 by Matt B

    Matt welcome aboard.  Congrats on taking the decision to quit.  I really like your idea and in some ways wish there had something like this in my early days -- keep strong!!!!
Welcome Matt i’m Just over 2 weeks in my quit. You will love it here. A lot of great information and helpful people, who all want to see you succeed. Which in this day and age is amazing all by itself.
    This is the perfect spot for this thread @Matt B.       So the games thread here is not anything about computer games...it's just games you can play to help get past a prickly moment, they are more social interaction. Music threads are good too.   During my first week a customer in Sydney made a comment he had to call before I went on smoko...and I felt pretty stoked to tell him I'd quit...his advice, just worry about not smoking today, one day that's it. Only focus on the day. If ya into omens I quit just before an Ashes series, an still going strong so clearly Ashes season is a grouse time to quit.
    Jo  pardon my ignorance but what is ashes season? 
    I'll join you Matt.  Let's see who can last the longest!

@Sazerac Seventh day going good as far as quitting smoking goes. It would have been 4 months today, had I not blown the quit last week. I really regret it because it's daunting to start from scratch again.Edited August 2 by Ankush
@Ankush Look for beauty,    Remember to breathe !   Nurture yourself.   Reward yourself for every crave you conquer.
@Sazerac Yup, did the nurturing with exercise and a heavy lunch
    Well done A !!!!    Don't look back....keep focused on  the, future ....guard this Quit with your life ....

     @Damona, @Matt B and @Ankush       Here is a thread about what helped us during the first weekFirst Week, Nicotine Free        please add your tips and tricks
Hi All,     Thanks for your kind comments - Sadly I had a min-relapse - 1/2 smoke But I'm keen to get on top of this.    So here goes..  Day 1/7 - feeling quite good 7/10   Day 2&3 are always the hardest - so i'll try to check in a few times a day.     Best!
    Matt sorry about your relapse. You have to get  rid of all your cigarettes ashtray is anything that has to do with smoking so that you can be successful on this next quit. I changed the way I drink my coffee in the morning and each time I think about a smoke I tell myself I don’t smoke and I say it out loud. Sounds silly but it has helped. After all I’m going to have to re-condition my brain if I’m going to make this quit  stick.
    Hey Matt,sorry you relapsed. Have you seen our SOS forum? You post there anytime you feel yourself caving to a crave and members will give you that extra support you need to get past it. I used it a few times when I first quit and the support and encouragement was just what I needed to get past it and keep my quit. You can also do a pre response post to yourself.   You can do it and we'll support you as much as you need or want 
Thank you so much! I’m doing quite well today and I just finished a big gym workout. Tmrw I have gym and yoga.. I want to make myself super busy in the next few days so it’s a blur!   On the other hand I’m already 2 months into quitting alcohol with no sign of a relapse! I love green tea lol
    Yes keeping busy helps! 
@Matt B Keep busy, but try not to use any activity as a crutch for quitting smoking. This is because, in case you cannot perform a particular activity on a given day, you may start thinking of a smoke. Here's a video that may help:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc2KF_d64SY     Edited August 3 by Ankush
Sydney Australia day 1 finished !! All your advice helped a lot.btw cigarettes cost aud $45 for a 25 pack here. I.e around usd 35..gulp
    Congratulations on your quit, @Matt B   You may have some gnarly moments but, nothing you can't live through.   Cigarettes KILL quitting does not.      In all your free time, switch up your ticker and educate yourself about nicotine addiction. You do know that it is NOT just a habit like your avatar seems to intimate, right ?     Remember to keep yourself hydrated, have fruit juice hand to keep blood sugar in check. and have a think about what our friend, @Sirius says,'Next time a craving plunks down on your face ask yourself, "What price you are willing to pay to own yourself?"    
    I'm sorry to hear about your relapse but I'm glad you have started your quit again, Matt.       Keep posting about what you are going through.  It really helps.
Thanks all! Day 2/7...  Will be mindful of the cravings for sure.. I try to count them and use a 3 minute timer on my watch if I’m really struggling
        Take each crave at a time and reward yourself for conquering that particular receptor in your brain.    This is what it is all about.   Wrenching one receptor at a time away from nicotine and replacing it with a suitable reward.    I used oxygen and looking at beauty as rewards that were always at hand.The Significance of Rewards
    Hey, @Matt B,   Some people can slide through the first week or two, no problem.    I wasn't one of them but, I accepted the fact that it was going to suck for a while and came to terms with my reality.      Our friend, Sarge,  says, "Embrace The Suck"    OK....  I could live with that, I could live through that...I was determined.   It was worth it to me to be free.   The discomfort (and that is ALL it is) wasn't going to thwart me, no how no way.        Power through, sleep through, play through, do anything but smoke.  You can do it.   
Day 2-5 is always tricky for me.... I'm heading out now and will come back home briefly to get ready for yoga etc.  Will check back in tonight - really appreciate your support team!!
@Matt B Carry on with your day as usual, it will help you to learn to go about your life without smoking. Every activity will be like a new smoke-free activity. Enjoy it.
    I found if I changed my morning rituals ,it helped...showered before I did anything ..to wake me up,ready to fight the craves ...before I would make coffee and go have a few fags
Day 2/7 done! About to sleep. C u tmrw
Day 3/7 underway... gotta stay strong and crush the craves
@Matt B grab some lifesavers or chuppa chups or chewy to get through the day.. it helps.
    Yes gud idea!! Gonna drink epic amounts of water also
    Matt, great idea on the water, cold juice can help too.  Also you  might want to try Jillar's Air Cigarette (cut straw to size of cigarette) and use that with breathing techniques -- it can really help it did for me!!!
    You're doing great Matt and yes, if the craves get too bad post an SOS or try my air cigarette. It worked so good for me at tricking my mind into thinking it was getting the real thing 
I think I mentioned before cigarettes cost usd35 for a 25pack where I live. I want to reward myself tonight at the end of day 3 with a small item. Any suggestions?
    Ok so maybe most of you are asleep. I’ll check later tonight     
    I’ve come up with a few craving crusher strategies. Hope to share them with you soo n!
    Hey @Matt B how ya travelling...so suggestions for a small reward..me I'd get coffee down Lygon St but I'm a Melbournian, ya know what we are like with coffee....how about gold class at village for being a week free...that's only a couple a packs...or daily, give back, make a donation to the salvos or Smith family or the PJclub or Canteen... Um...buy yaself an expensive steak for dinner instead of budget shit from Woolies.  A box of Vegemite shapes, nothing beats Vegemite shapes.
Thx - nice ideas. My gym has a great chef - they do full meals - will get steak there on thurs. Day 3 done! in bed and bout to crash
Congrats on being smokefree for 3 days. One day at a time you can do it!

Struggling a bit at work today.. lots of chaos at work today. Gotta hang in there and as soon as I get home I’ll have an early night to lock in day 4
Stay strong you can do it. There will always be stress in life. You have to remind yourself that cigarettes don’t help your,stress. It’s your habit to smoke when you are stressed. Say to yourself I don’t smoke. It helps me I say it out loud. I’m trying to retrain myself. I’ve give cigarettes enough of my time. Not anymore. And good job coming here to post. Edited August 5 by Diane R

How do you determine your quit date?  I have always thought that the quit date is the date you smoke your last cigarette, even if you put it out at 11:59 p.m.  I notice that a lot of people use the next day as their quit date and it makes me curious.  So, what date do you use and why?
    I know seconds and minutes and hours really count in the beginning !    You have quit the moment you put out your last smoke.       I counted my first full day as my first day but,  my last smoke was late the night before.  This just felt comfortable and more convenient to me.            
@Damona I use the next day, simply because starting from the next day, there will be no more cigarettes. Irrespective of the time on a given day the last cigarette is smoked, that day is still a smoked day. Simply put, for me, the first day from when there is no smoking is the quit day.Edited August 2 by Ankush
I smoked my last cancer stick ,just before bed...so counted day 1 from the morning ...

I have always used the day I put out my last cigarette as my quit date. It was approx. 8:00 AM on a Sunday morning - my wake-up smoke. Put it out and never had another one. So to me, the day I made that conscious decision to smoke one then not smoke anymore is my actual quit date. As others have said though, in the grand scheme of things, it matters not the actual date you quit. It just matters that you DID quit and remain quit
I put my last cigarette out at about 11:58 or 11:59 AM on a Sunday morning.  I decided a couple of days prior that I would smoke my last cigarette right before noon that day.      I count that day (November 16) as my quit day but I can see the argument for saying I should have counted my first full day smoke free as my quit day.      It is a personal preference as long as you never take another puff.Edited August 2 by johnny5
Well for me I started taking Chantix. I didn’t pick a start date, I just let the Chantix start to work about 3 week after I started it I smoked 2  drags of a cigarette and put it out. I haven’t had one since. But I still thinking about smoking all the time. I tell myself out loud I don’t smoke! Now I’m to the point where I forget to take my Chantix. It does get easier with time. I will say I was keeping myself in withdrawals for the first few weeks. The only downside to the Chantix for me. You are going cold turkey so you won’t have that. But this is where this forum helps someone told me I was keeping myself in withdrawal. And I was sick for 3 weeks. So I just put that stick out and didn’t look back. Stay close to the forum. Everyone here is so  supportive. It really can make all the difference. One day at a time.
When I quit I smoked my last cigarette right after eating lunch around midday .  I didn’t start counting until the next day though, but I guess if I want to pad my “total days quit” number, that half day (0.5) could be rounded up to include one more day.          To be honest I’m not certain that the day in my ticker is THE date.  When I had made it a month without smoking and knew this was THE quit, I tried to nail down the date.  I knew it was the Memorial Day weekend just not sure if it was a Saturday or Sunday, so I’ll cal mine (current days) +/- 1.5        Seriously though just don’t smoke anymore.  When you reach one year and more, does it really matter in the grand scheme of things.                   Edited August 2 by Wayne045
    Quite a variety of answers.  Thanks everyone!  It's something I was curious about and enjoyed reading the replies.  Whatever works for each individual...it's all good.  I tend to do the ritual like Boo mentioned.  I'm not satisfied unless I get a good long drag for my last puff which seems so silly to the rational portion of my brain.
I smoked my last cigarette January 31st at about 11 pm. I had smoked quite heavy that day just to get rid of the pack  I wanted to start a fresh day without smoking, hence 1st feb was my preferred quit day.

G’day   I had a cig on the Friday night 9th oct 2015, nothing surprising about that, can’t remember what time.  I was on the champix and my day, was to be that next week.  i got up next morning and that’s when the magic happened. I got up and didn’t smoke. Not One. Was it the champix... who cares   0830 came around and I knew this was the day!   Hunted up all my cigs the ashtrays the butts the lot. Drowned them in the kitchen sink. Dumped the mess in the bin And took my sweetheart out to a movie.   She took 4 days to figure out I wasn’t smoking.     I keep going toward. It will be 4 years this October 10 at 0830. Couldn’t care less about that last cig. This was that moment that I quit. I refused to go back.    EVER
My quit date is 20th June 2012 even though I smoked that day. I quit suddenly in the middle of the day (around 3.30pm) without making any kind of a plan prior to that. So that is the day that I quit.

    There's a wealth of information available to us all when it comes to smoking and quitting. I'm glad you're looking into this kind of stuff. Every little bit helps you quit and stay quit. Knowledge is power!
    Interesting, I used or ate many of things listed on a regular basis -- wonder if had/has helped me in any way?
    here is another thread Foods for Healthy Lungs  andTomatoes May Restore Lung Damage
    Martin I can’t hurt. Lord knows our ancestors used all kinds of things to heal themselves.  I love tomatoes. I eat them a lot. 
Aww my poor lungs !!!!!.....I dread to think what they looked like ...after smoking 52 years ...    2 burnt kippers I imagine ...hopefully they have mended some over the years Smoke Free...
    I woke up this morning feeling pretty good!  I'm always grateful to God for another day.  But I was especially happy to see that Ms. @Linda Thomas has one year !!!! I truly am happy for her.  Way to go Ms. Linda!!WooWoo!!!.  So I thought that I might spread some cheer to all the non smokers out there and say HIP HIP HOORAY !!!!! We are on our WAY!!!!!!
    It is a big rush to celebrate with Linda, isn't it !    I also get a charge out of the NOPE thread, it is like holding hands around the world and strengthening our quits.      Thanks for sharing your positivity and building a beautiful quit, QueenB.  Glad you are here.
    Oh !!!!I agree....it's a brilliant day....  We are all proud of Linda.....  Every smoker can be where Linda is today ,just commit to NOPE ...
In all honesty, If we take a look back from where ever it was we started.   And see just how far we have come!!!  Whether its 1 day 1 week 1 month 1 year. You have to admit that it brings joy, confidence,    self respect, determination..... A whole new you!!!!  Fabulous YOU!!!

    This seems fitting       
Nicotine stimulates the reward path in our brain    and by replenishing ourselves with nicotine, we were rewarded with Dopamine.    Many times a day we went from the panic of, 'I've gotta have a smoke' to 'Ahhh', the brief relief of satisfying addiction.   We were jerking our own chain every twenty minutes or so....for years.  When quitting nicotine, that dance of our reward system shuts down.    It's a shock and we miss the consistent rewarding rush of dopamine. Our brain doesn't understand where all the feel good stuff went so, it is essential to amplify rewards, to jump start our natural pathways for the release of Dopamine.  The physical act of rewarding ourselves is crucial for the brain to access Dopamine.   It took me a moment to wrap my head around this,The Physical Act of Rewarding Ourselves, Is Crucial For The Brain To Access Dopamine.    Our friend, bakon, is a big advocate of rewards, quite rightly, too.   Celebrate your first moments, days...your first weeks and months.

My biggest reward..me and my two feet are still together..and I might add..Enjoying the new smoke free life..I'm doing more ,than I did 10 years ago...
I preach rewards for a simple reason. WHEN YOU QUIT it is hard work. Easy peasy might be a good saying but there is some put your head down, lean forward, and keep marching moments. So you deserve a reward for doing what's necessary.   Second reason is even former smokers have forgotten those moments are work. So nobody can feel what you're doing exactly. And so they say good job but did they buy you a cupcake and sing? No. Have to do it for yourself. Never thought about replacing dopamine but I guess that's true. Rewards give a reinforcement to the work.   NOPE helps do the work. A reward reinforced reason to do it.        And people just need a little help sometimesEdited December 19, 2018 by bakon
Rewards are not replacing dopamine, they are activating dopamine.  Replacing Nicotine with a 'feel good'  activity encourages the release of Dopamine. I only recently learned this and remembered how you always accentuate rewards, now there's even more reason. As far as 'feet apart'...I like soles together behind a neck or waist.  To be filed under 'Tantric Rewards'. :DPleasure is more pleasurable nicotine free, for sure.
My rewards were very important to me...it was my way of telling myself..how wonderful I was..And what a amazing thing i was achieving ..I was changing my whole life as I had known it...Spending my hard earned cash on me..Expensive, smelling candles...I wouldn't have been bothered while I smoked...

The picture of our receptors being pirated by nicotine.     These are the receptors of our reward responses that thankfully return to normal when we quit but, can be encouraged and hastened during the change by actively rewarding yourself.     Edited to find the photo and can't but, this may be helpful      Edited September 18 by Sazerac
Thank you for posting the picture's..........wow, I cannot believe my brain is still somewhat 'normal' LOL after 20+ year's of smoking.  Looking at these picture's and thinking of different scenarios: out w/friends, on a phone call, stressing out over my mother who has dementia and how many cigarettes I smoke.....so, so, so many cigarettes. OMG! This is a huge reality check! xo
I've had the joy of going to Tenerife each year, since not wasting thousands on somoking. The money not wasted has meant us Sifford's have had an absolute blast. I build up to it, and am excited every single day when I think I'm going back. It's like medication really...I can't put into words the thrill it gives be to be able to go once a year, to my second home. Had I still been smoking, not got my head down and worked through the discomfort, we wouldn't have had a holiday every year, no way. The added beauty is I also love the fact I'm not clock watching once in the airport..thinking can't have a smoke for the next six hours. The freedom of that is priceless. Reward yourself...treat yourself...relish on what you spend the money on instead of wasting it..on cancer sticks.

    bump.   Creating new rewards, true rewards for yourself is an essential part of recovering from nicotine addiction. You can also have some fun with rewards and be really kind to yourself. Rewards can be free...a bubble bath, an interesting walk, a nap...  or small purchases...you know what you would enjoy. My rewards got bigger the longer I stayed quit, the more ducats saved.       
    another bump after hearing about Lilly's Charm Bracelet in her blog.
    Her idea of the charm bracelet was fabulous  Anything you can use to encourage yourself to quit and stay quit is well worth what ever effort it requires!Your addiction will try it's best to defeat your efforts once you quit so you have to outsmart the addiction. It's totally possible using tools such as Lilly has done 
    Hip hooray! I love rewards! Daily/small task rewards=chocolates, hard candies, nice tea/coffee/beer     Monthly/anniversaries=nice dinner, haircut +style, new socks/undies,        Doesn't have to be something big every time, but always tell yourself "This is my reward for xxx" to really reinforce the good behavior association with the dopamine release.      Try new things! The new you might like new things!!     (It was mentioned above but I'll also throw out that sex is the best release of dopamine, oxytocin, and endorphins. And, like I said, try new things)

Am enjoying reading these great posts.    Came online just now because I've been wrestling with a strong crave for the past 30 minutes.       Went through H.A.L.T., but not hungry, angry, lonesome, or tired. I feel cranky and whiny and longing for a smoke. I can feel the wanting of it in my throat. (The addict emoting.) You bumped this yesterday morning, Paul  (my time, anyway), and here it is at the moment I need the right thing to explain this non-HALT craving and what to do to get through it.      Going to the grocery store now, in search of something dopaminergic.  It'll probably be something from the pastry family. Or ice cream. I'll save getting both for surviving a bigger craving.

    Yep
I still struggle with finding rewards. I'm very sedentary due to a serious knee injury/impending surgery. I've given up sweets, my usual reward, because losing weight is an emergency for me due to my knee problems. Its hard for me to get into and out of the bathtub but I'll try tonight because I love baths and I have some delicious smelling bubble bath. I do have two books going and I could do some stepwork (12 step program) but that doesn't really feel like a reward lol. I asked for suggestions for a sedentary non smoker but I can't find the thread so if you don't mind, throw out anything you can think of. What did you reward yourself with?Edited July 24 by MichelleDoesntSmokeAnymoreFixed typo
    Do you like music?  I listened to the same song everyday for the first month of quitting on my drive to work.  You could pick a theme song to inspire you and reward yourself that way.
Oh if you like sweets and can do  Splenda whenever I diet I get favored coffee add a litttle half and half and Splenda. It’s like a  dessert. Target has some wonderful favors. My 10 year old grandson said one day grandma I smell chocolate what are you baking. It was my coffee. I felt like I was being  naughty but I wasn’t. I still keep it here.
    I do. I Liisten to music every day. I'll try to identify a song that has "Quit Smoking" energy in it. Great suggestion, thanks!
    I listen to BUTT KICKING music so when I'm thinking about those horrible smokes!!! BAM BAM BAM  head banging for sure ….. Kick that craving right in the throat!!!! Ohhhhh wait, we're talking about REWARDS.  LOLOLO yeaaahhhh Um I just go by something small lipstick,  magazine, nothing of any importance just because I can!!! LOVE IT    It's the mood I'm in......I'm allowed LOL
    I gave myself frequent rewards like a dinner at a nice restaurant or new sneakers.  After some time and significant savings I'd go for bigger stuff like a new sofa or new truck.  But, by far, the best reward came from my body itself.  I went from a tired couch potato to an extremely active hiker and backpacker.  Here's a picture of the reward I'm giving myself very soon.  Two weeks of backpacking the John Muir Trail.

Hello QTrain,    I was looking last night for information on No Man's Land to help someone,  I wasn't clear on when this happens for some people and thought tosome anecdotal evidence might be useful.Please, those of you who had this experience, would you add questions and answer away ?Did you experience No Man's Land ? How far along in your Quit were you ?How did it feel ?How long did  it last ?What tools helped you through ?What did you learn ?    7/31/19I have since learned that once the bright and shiny has worn off a quit, when quitting it is no longer a minute by minute concern, smokey thoughts can rumble up in a powerful way.  This can happen anytime, of course but, they may take us by surprise when we are feeling confident and complacent in our quit.We are dealing with addiction.  Vigilance must be maintained.  Protect your quit.                             Edited July 31 by Sazerac
I'm not sure if I ever ventured into no-mans-land per se, but I did struggle at 3 and 6 months, which could have turned into NML if I hadn't done something about it. I just started to feel a little lost, and a little complacent.. And AS SOON as I started feeling like that, I posted about it... And my quit smoking family lent me their strength to get through.   It lasted a couple of days on each occasion, and I learnt that accountability is extremely important, for me at least.  I would even go on record to say that without my non-smoking family, I would have gone back to smoking a long time ago. So, I'm not really sure if that was NML, or maybe pre-NML, but I hope what I said helps someone.
No Mans Land... hmmm....a bit of a construct. There comes a time when quitting is not new, its not exciting. Nobody is saying WOW! anymore. In short, life goes back to being life.  At times - I was bored. I wanted to smoke. Junkie thinking creeps in....Ahhhhh! It's no mans land! No it aint. It's life.  There's a danger in ascribing a name or a timeline to it. Self-fulfilling prophesy and all that.. Action is right - when stuff feels a bit weird - post. That's what the forum is here for.
I've just gone thru NML.. (well at least i think I'm coming out on the other side).. for me it was that at the start of my quit, I was so excited and proud of myself, every day was such a big deal for me.. I had set a date about 3 months out to let my family know I had been quit, so I had that to hang on to an look fwd to.. that day came an went (great day by the way :) ) and then it just kind of got... don't know.. like those who where so happy for me when they found out i quit were just kind of "you quit-good-on with life"..they didn't seem to understand it was still a daily thing for me "NOPE just for today"  and it felt like all the "new" had gone out of my quit...and my enthusiasm to keep on-staying quit was die'n out... the truth is I didn't know I was in so much trouble until someone else posted something that hit a cord with me- how i was feeling- I commented on that and before I knew it my QT family was "riding in to the rescue"... if not for the "family" here, I'm pretty sure I would have gone back to smoking,... ....but see? thats why it's sooooooo important to post how you feel... you may never know who you help.... or how what  say will alert others here that you're in trouble - and "can't see the forest for the trees" like what happened with me.. and they "swoop in" to help... so, my advice.. be aware it can happen.. an if "the family" picks up on something you said in a post and say you might need an extra helping hand -TAKE IT- open up-talk-post- don't be like me and try to go it alone.. I forgot I was here for the love and support the lovely folks here have to offer.. I didn't want to admit I was have'n a hard time and it almost cost me my quit at just before 6 mo. ...
S, this post is a brilliant idea! It will be so helpful to refer to when going through those rough times. Keep posting your experiences here all you wonderful non-smokers :) Sandy
At the risk of angering the easy peasy brigade :) I totally think I went through this. But I agree it's just giving it a name, in other words it's phases of not smoking. 6 weeks - went bat shizzle, totally prompted by forever fear! Posted, big save, phew! Month 2 - this foot that foot. All felt a bit ploddy, no excitement, no real drama. Missed my brass band and wondered where they had trailed off too when I still thought about smoking all the time. Verbally threatened Joel on the laptop many times with his (in my mind at the time) divvy assessment of two smoking thoughts per day. Pfft.. classic over achieving yet again by me!! Or dramatic, could be either. I was not comfortably happy but I was not smoking. Month 3 - Oh how I hated thee. wanna smoke, don't smoke, wanna smoke, don't smoke - WANNA - DONT DO IT...went on for a month for me because I refused to acknowledge it. Made my quit stronger though! Never felt the need to SOS, knew I wouldn't smoke, got real annoyed my own brain was tryna catch me out - what's that about?! I call it the rinse and repeat month now, seems to be common.  Month 4 was bliss :)  All peace and flower power of quitting, sooo lovely. Month 5 was a bundle of stress. But life is pretty tough month 5, so life or quitting...think that one was life tbh. Lots of "previously I would smoke here" thoughts but nothing more sinister then that.  Month 6 where I am now, seems calmer but only a week in lol. I do have thoughts of smoking, it seems the quicker I dismiss them as not a possibility (smoking is not o the table) then I can move on. Just occasionaly the thought lingers and I have to mentally bop myself over the head :)  I think the trick is to post and the guys are right about that. Especially month 2 and 3 I used to really over think what I could post about, just to post and get some feedback. In the same time period I started to exercise, somewhat unhappily and prompted mainly by weight gain (damn you peanuts). But actually, that was a major win, exercise I found not only dismissed the thoughts, I didn't think about smoking during and it gave me some form of happy vibe that I had missed a lot. Maybe an endorphin thing??  All of the above just made me hold tighter to my quit. Sometime in that time frame I posted something to the effect of, I know my quit is safe because I'm never going to be able to do week 1 or some of these days again. I held to that. No matter how much it sucked, if I just held on I would never have to face that day, that trigger, that time again!  x
I didnt experience no mans land but I did set myself up for a difficult no womans minefield in my quit because when I quit before I lasted exactly 6 months so my goal this time was to get past 6 months after the 6 months quit the buzz was no longer there and I can totally sympathise with what Lace said above and then life got stressful and it was a struggle to hold on and then my whole life changed and the only thing that would have been familiar was a smoke my mindset and the board saved me, posting, reaching out continuing to trust what others say and holding the hell on for dear life, excepting a hug and a kick up the butt and then move on my goal now is to take things a day at a time, stress will come and go in life roll with the punches tommorow is a new day and smoking will not change a darn thing and if I get them thoughts I look at the other areas in my life that are bringing the thoughts up and deal with that   if you are in no mans land - its time to find a new goal or new hobby or new buzz if you are struggling emotionally then please reach out we are all here with one goal and thats to quit for the rest of our lives, whatever it takes
This quit for me hasn't been easy peasy  ,I kicked and screamed my way through the early months....I gripped on  to the board with my finger nails diggin.....No mans land.....if I smoked ,I'm sure my future would have been ....a land for no man.....
Pretty much same here. I also dumped my arsehole boyfriend at the same time so I'm not sure I'm 'normal'.  I had bad days, still do, feel down, depressed, desperate - lots and lots of crying, lots of seeing my mum for hugs The worst part was when I found out I was dating a married man and just felt stupid and used and desperately wanted to curl up into a ball and smoke packet after packet I guess punishing myself for being stupid. I didn't smoke. I cried instead. And hugged friends and my mum for all the hugs they could give. I'm still not smoking. And still not being beaten up on a regular basis. Its pretty amazing really.
Did you experience No Man's Land ? YesHow far along in your Quit were you ? Right around 6 MonthsHow did it feel ? It sucked ass...  it was nicotenes last ditch effort...and it was a good effort.How long did  it last ? I would say a couple of weeksWhat tools helped you through ?  I had a hard(ish) quit and there was no way in hell that I was going to quit quitting at this point...kept fightingWhat did you learn ?  Always stay on my toes and never look back.
Yes, No Man's Land is when all the shiny new is gone off the quit...and it becomes just hard work.  I found this post online here in someone's quit smoking journal, and I think it describes it very well...  No Man's Land. Repost for jhhawaii                               By tahoehal  on May 13 2008 at 5:54 pm  77, Male                                Las Vegas                               NV, United States                               Member Since: September 01 2004 « Previous Entry  Next Entry »                                                              I seldom start a post, unless it is to honor someone's anniversary. But I feel compelled to share something that I seem to be sharing a lot of lately... and that is my thoughts on 'No Man's Land'. No Man's Land is a dangerous and scary place... and it is a lonely time during a quit.                                 I call No Man's Land that period of time between about 1 month and 3 or 4 months into your quit, or about the time from the end of your first month.. This is a time when many people slip and go into a full relapse and have to start over... if they can start over, that is. I have some observations that may help some of you who are literally hanging on by your fingernails... or who may find yourself there tomorrow.                                    The first month is an exhausting but exhilirating experience... you are locked in nearly daily struggles and you get the satisfaction of successfully beating your addiction that day. You go to bed a WINNER each night (as Troutnut would say), and you are justifiably proud of yourself. Your friends and family are also supportive as they see you struggling each day to maintain your quit. And you are being constantly supported here, whether or not you post... just being here is good for your quit. And so, the battles are won and it actually becomes easier and the battles occur less often as you finish 30 days or so.                                 Around 60 days, you're starting to have some really good days, with very few craves and some nice insights about yourself... but then again, you still have some bad days. Those bad days can really be depressing... you begin to wonder if you're ever gonna be able to relax. Your junkie is whispering to you, telling you that 'just one' won't hurt. You've conquered your daily triggers, but now you start trippiing over the occasional ones... a death in the family, unexpectedly bad news, money problems, health problems, going on a long car ride, a trip to the bar, or whatever. You have a strong crave and you begin to doubt your ability to keep your quit.                                    In addition, the 3D support that you used to get is pretty much gone... non-smokers figure you should be 'over it' by now, smokers don't like to hang around you much because they feel guilty and addicted (remember that feeling?), and people who have quit may not remember just how much love and support you need well into the first few months. They all think you should be 'over it', you think you should be 'over it'... and the temptation is to have 'just one' to see if you ARE over it.                                    But of course you're not over it, are you? That 'just one' whisper becomes much much louder and becomes 'just one more'... and each time you give in to that whisper, the craves come harder and sooner. The one way to guarantee that your craves will never go away is to light up, to slide that old cigarette needle into your arm and shoot up. Those craves will be back and keep coming back. But if you protect your quit, your craves will eventually weaken and become even fewer and farther between.                                    As you get to around 100 days or so (some will be a bit longer)... you will begin to really get a healthy perspective on your addiction. You will see the huge role that smoking played in your life, you will see clearly what that addiction really cost you. And you will understand that it was a very high price to pay... the loss of your confidence, your emotions, your self-control... your SELF. All enslaved to your addiction.                                 And you will begin to see that you can look forward to a non-smoking future without romanticizing your addiction. You see it clearly for the life-stealing evil it was... and is. You see a much different future for yourself than your past has been. And it no longer scares the crap out of you to think that you are done smoking... in fact, you embrace that thought with joy every day.                                 But you have to get out of No Man's Land first. How can you help yourself? And how can those of us who have been through it help you?                                   First of all, you need to understand that you aren't alone. If you haven't already done so, make a pinky-finger promise with 2 or 3 good quitbuds and exchange phone numbers with them. Promise to call them if you're ever in trouble, and make them promise the same. These are your 'life and death' quitbuddies... you are literally trusting each other with your lives. Then call them... often. Just to see how they are doing, and to tell them you're doing well too. Be totally honest with them, this is life and death.                                 Second, understand that you're going to have some unexpectedly bad days... but they are going to be further apart. Shrug them off, laugh your way through them, call your quitbuddies... whatever it takes to get through them without smoking. Some battles will be easy, some will be hard. Come here and post, send qmail, exercise, learn to cook, take up a new hobby. Whatever it takes, keep going to bed a WINNER each night.                                   Third, ask some of the older qsters to keep an eye on you... to contact you to see how you're doing. I have been asked to do that for several of you recently and I am happy to do that, as I am sure that others are too. We know that you just need to hold on a little bit longer and change your focus just a little to make that breakthrough. And then you will OWN your quit, and it will be a very comfortable thing.                                   Last, take a deep and honest look at your past life... your life as a smoker and compare it to what your life is like now... and what it will be like in the future. You have to develop that vision of your future, of the person that you are going to BECOME now that you have freed yourself. You have to believe in yourself. You have to love yourself enough to deny yourself your addiction.                                    No Man's Land doesn't have to be so lonely and scary and dangerous. You need some company and some courage and some faith in yourself. And when you emerge from it, you will not be the same person that entered it.                                    Never never never question your decision to quit! This is the most loving thing that you will ever do for yourself. A few days of discomfort in exchange for a lifetime of freedom. You will never find another deal like it.                                   Protect your quit. Don't smoke, no matter what.

So-called "No Man's Land" is an imaginary, self-fulfilling, Land Of Make Believe. It is superstitious Woo-Woo of the highest order. If you do not want to experience No Man's Land, you do not have to.   Easy Peasy
I remember when the quit lost its excitement. I could no longer float around being proud of myself for not smoking. It was old news now and I needed to get a life. It was a sad feeling, but like everything else it was part of the process. A yucky place to be, put your foot on the gas pedal and get out of there.

Uh O...Sarge is back.  Ok.. give it to me.....
No man's land, I heard of it but never been there! I think I saw the exit for it off the highway once but never stopped, too much going on! My quit never lost its excitement for me because of Tracey, this place, and some other things! If you do end up there remember not to spend too much time there because, You are starting your new life as a non smoker,  so you will be making some new friends,  will be going to some new places,  have new things to try and do, and new experiences!!!!
It is what is. Nothing more nothing less. Just keep NOPEING. Keep moving forward, it does get better. I promise.  :)
I have never been 'there' either, only heard about it. Today,  I have learned a lot about people's experience around a certain time in a quit.This is important to me and I love the resource of human experience, QTrain provides.We all bring something to the table,something that may resonate with another quitter and help them in some way.Thank you QTrain.
Sarge.....WooWoo is actually an alcoholic drink which makes you as the name suggests go Woowoo :D I feel myself I hit upon no mans land around firstly the 3 month mark, I felt strange, alienated, did not know where I was heading, what I wanted, I could never put my finger on anything, but knew something was amiss, felt like I was wading through thick mud and staring through fog, some of us quitter really believe in no-man's land and some of don't which is what makes us all unique and individual in our own right.  The next time I hit no man's land was at the end of the 6 months and again it lasted approximately a month, but during the month I became complacent and began to romance the though of a cigarette again, and yes I relapsed, will I hit no man's land again this time around, who knows, but if I do I certainly know how to deal with it xxx
Sarge.....WooWoo is actually an alcoholic drink which makes you as the name suggests go Woowoo :D This is the Woo-Woo to which Sarge refers.    Easy Peasy
Not sure about no man's land but I have had periods of cravings that came after long periods of no cravings. There was a period right after six months when it was tough because I wanted very badly to be a" social smoker."  Now by reading here and knowing about the concept of No Man's Land, I knew that cravings come and go, and if I embraced the suck, the period would pass.  Lately, Thank God, I have been free. 
Isn't that the beauty of the QT. Everyone has had a different quit and can share that experience freely.  I, like Chrispy, had a hell of a quit in the beginning and now at this point (8 months in) if thoughts or "craves" try to creep in I just think about how hard it was. Never. again. I pride myself on being a smart girl... how incredibly stupid would I have to be to ever smoke again.
DING DING DING  New visitor to NML WTF
Buckle down my friend. Breathe through. Keep to the boards. Eat. It will go away soon. I was a mean mean person for awhile 
NML feels sucky but is a really crucial part of the quit.  It actually feels like month 3 was probably the "cement it in"month, all those rinse and repeat thoughts are your junkie DYING off, although I appreciate it feel different.  It's not though and take it from one who trudged wearily too, it is your junkie brain in a go big or go home call back...do not listen!!  Message people, post tripe, hit up the swear thread, stay in touch here and we can keep your sparkle alive. I always tried to remember two things. 1. After a hard day, an easy, or even a few easy days would come. 2.That a lot of people struggled in this time frame, but had later happy quits so it has to end right! I promise you it's worth it. And keep reality about you, it's just thoughts, nothing like the early days, just lots of thoughts. How many dumb things have we done by thinking about them...probably loads :)  Don't let the thoughts take hold is all. x
I don't really believe in 'self fulfilling prophecies'especially in regards to 'no man's land'.Some folks hit a bump in the road after the shine of the quit has worn off.They are not alone.N O P E   N O P E  N O P E  and NOPE.
Another pot hole on the freedom road.   Stay focused and remain committed. The transition between smoking and not smoking can sometimes require sayinggoodbye, at least temporarily, to our smoking buddies. Feelings of isolation and loneliness can happen.   Recognize it if and when it happens and make sure you have the friends you need near at hand.

    bump and HERE is a great post Nancy found 
Great post and very interesting....another post coming at a time when needed. No Man's Land....I can say for sure been there or still there or Post Acute Withdraw..which ever freakin one you want to call it. Hit me a month or so ago. Depression anxiety ..all that crap but not as bad as the first time around when I first quit. I don't know how the brain works or when it just says hey guess what I am going to freak out for a while get you back on the right path then leave you alone so you can get shit straight again. I know one thing for sure I am much better and does it really ever go away. I really don't think so it's just another thing in life you learn to deal with over time and before you know it your not thinking junkie thinking. All I know for sure is that one day I think you just have had enough and it's time to move on and your brain says okay your right now lets get on with it. I don't know what happened to me but rest assure I will never forget it or get over confident again. I really do think it's the brain playing tricks doing a last ditch effort to get you to light up again. I read articles where ppl have this the rest of their lives. Well if thats the case then so be it. Just flare ups once and a while for a month or so then they go away. I came to the choice of hey why not. I have many other things to deal with in life what's one more. I will admit it can be very stressful at times but I have learned to accept it as a friend coming. You can't deny it so accept it and just say.."hey your back again,how long you going stick around this time"? Out smart yourself takes a bit of practice , which I am still working on but it helps. Anyway keep the quit..YOU CAN DO IT      Edited March 23, 2018 by stzr500

I had mentioned to my family of smokers that it was my quitiversary and my sister responded, "We knowwww you tell us all the time."     Shot to the heart. I was confused that they had already stopped supporting me. But, now I understand that it's their own addiction that keeps them from being happy for me. What helped was being a part of a community of quitters that would celebrate with me because they truly understood! Refreshing! I went thru alot of personal stuff early in my quit. Stuff that could have broke a weak person, but during that time I learned that I'm strong.

(bump)   During the first year of your quit, prepare yourself with distractions, pleasures and rewards for any craves/triggers that seem to come out of nowhere.  Do not let them catch you unawares or find you cocky and careless.     It takes vigilance to deal with nicotine addiction, no kidding.You really have to be on point, specially the first year.    However, it isn't all 'fight or flight'.There will be days/weeks/months of just living freeand then some folks will have a doozie of a trigger.I had a big gnarly one at 10 months.  I came here and received incredible support. I wasn't going to smoke and thankfully, it passed. It was the last serious hurdle for me.     Remember, you are stronger and smarter than any trigger/craveand this is another opportunity to really reward yourself.Do not be shy with rewards ! They are an important part of the process.Put the word, 'Lavish', to the forefront of your vocabulary.  The Significance of Rewards         Edited February 14 by Sazerac

I found this online, here. A message from your body. (Repost)  By tahoehal  on November 03 2007 at 4:39 pm   Insert your own name .........and days of being smoke free x.Dear ..........It has been x days since you have quit smoking. You probably don't recognize me since you have been real busy for about x years. I am your body and I wanted to have a conversation with you.There are some things I need to tell you and share with you. You may need them now that you are recovering and I for the first time can express them.I am your lungs, your heart, your eyes, your liver, your blood, your skin and your mind.For x years, ......., you have been smoking and I have been unable to talk to you. It's not that there were times when I did not try, because I did.I sent you all sorts of signals to let you know I wanted to talk to you and you were not able to hear me. You passed it off as a morning cough or dizziness and whatever you were doing for all those years was too strong for me to fight.I have been waiting for this conversation with you for years.I must first tell you that we don't miss the smoke you filled us with.There were days when you were out, having a good time in the summer sun and I was too.I like the warm air and I even like the sun. But, ........, even on those wonderful days you would take the time to fill my lungs with smoke, my blood with carbon monoxide and my brain with nicotine. Every time I thought things were getting better and I was ready to talk to you there would be a burst of all these chemicals and I had to spend all of my energy, and YOUR energy, ......., on trying to keep you alive.I think you get the point now and I don't want to sound critical although I may have come off that way. What I really need to tell you is that for the past x days I have been working hard with the rest of your body ,to heal from a lot of years of neglect.I guess I want to say THANK YOU. Thank you, ......., for having the courage and the strength to quit smoking.If you have ever done anything right for me, by not smoking you have given me a new life. I need to tell you that it will take time for me to heal. You know how long you smoked, ........ It will take a bit of time to work with the lungs and the brain and the heart but IT WILL HAPPEN. Every cell in your body congratulates you... ....I need to warn you about something.One of the drugs that the brain thought it liked was Nicotine. That's a bad drug. It fooled me into thinking that I needed it.I never picked up a cigarette in my life and you made me addicted to Nicotine. Hey, I know it was not your fault! But there will be some difficulty the next few days and months. I, too, became addicted to that drug and it will take some time before I get rid of that. But I have a promise that I want to give you now that I can talk to you. If you promise to not smoke and to give this your very best shot, and I know how hard it is for you, I will reward you with more than great health, ........... And in time you will not only feel better but I will give you something that you thought you lost a long time ago.Remember your self-esteem and your image?Well I know who you are and I want you to know that I LOVE YOU. In time you will feel better and be so proud of what you accomplished-This I promise you.By the way!In this process of getting better we will be doing a lot of work inside.So please feed me and water me like you would if you were taking care of a beautiful Rose.It's time that you started to look after yourself with love, understanding and compassion as well; we like that too.Everything you give to me during this process I will reward you with tenfold. I believe in you, .......I AM YOU. I KNOW you can do this. I don't want to have to wait another x years to have this conversation with you. Know that I love you and know that it is unconditional. It seem at times like I am working against you but know that I am working with you, .........., to heal US.Just for Today, ......., please do not smoke. Thank you for listening to me. I love you!Sincerely,Your lungs, heart, liver, blood, mind and skin and every living cell in you.

    How are you both getting along  !!!!......
Thanks for asking Doreen.  Actually, I was doing well.  Then I ran into a problem, well not really, but it seemed like one from my junkie perspective.  I completed two days smoke free.  Then I had to get together with family.  It was something that came up spontaneously and I didn't have a good excuse to get out of it.  I was worried that I was going to be crabby with it being day 3 and I caved.  So, I am starting again.  I don't have to go anywhere for the next few days so I really have no excuse.  Also, I think I need to stay on the board for these first few difficult days instead of keeping to myself.Edited May 3 by Mona
    Hey Mona, glad you're back and have quit again. The first month is by far the hardest. But to insure a solid quit we recommend taking the One Year Pledge. It's a commitment to the board that you'll stay close for the next year to  help you past all the seasons and occasions that come up in a year, like family gatherings.  I was glued to the board my whole first year and it really helped get me through it.
    Never give up ..giving up ....  When the urge to smoke comes ...you have to fight through it ,with all you have ...each time you fight the monster and win ,he gets weaker ..
    I still haven't smoked.          
    Well done Lilly ....your doin great !!!!

    Hows it going @Lilly and @Damona? Long time since we've heard from you both
Hi Ankush.  Going through a lot of stress right now but have quit again.  Almost have 1 day.

    Smoking and feeding your addiction only adds to whatever stress you are going through.  I hope you honor yourself and a commitment to NOPE.  It is the way to a successful quit.     
@Damona Stress can be a very powerful negative thing, there's no denying that. In fact, it can be the most powerful trigger for ex-smokers to go back to smoking, but that's just my opinion. We have to be wary of triggers caused by stress. Look at the positive though, you are back to your quit. Take @Sazerac's advice above ^^. Stay close to the board and talk to the people here. They will help. Here's hoping that you can pull off your quit, all the best!!!
    Good to see you back ....never give up ....giving up !!!
    I also think stress is the primary reason for most relapses. The false belief that smoking relieves that stress is why so many light up again only to find, they feel like crap! Not only is their stress still there but they have just ruined their quit as well. We use smoking as an avoidance tool. Go have a smoke so we don't have to face the situation that is causing the stress. Smoking releases endorphins in the brain which gives us a temporary "good feeling". That's why we think smoking relieves stress - that temporary good feeling we get when we light up. Your stress is still there. The situation that caused the stress is still there. Plus, now you have another stress in your life. The stress that begins building as soon as you put out that smoke. Stress because you're an addict and you need that next fix. Break the cycle - just quit! 
Well I made it  through the first week! My badge from my app! Edited July 23 by Diane R
    Congratulations, Diane on your First Week of Freedom !  This is a very big deal and you need to reward yourself.
It’s funny I love all the little badges that app gives me. The app is quit now in case anyone wants  to get it.Edited July 23 by Diane R
    That is fantastic Diane, congratulations     
Somedays I thought I might cave. But than I remembered all the  fatigue,  nausea, and moodiness I have had. And I thought better of it. I sure don’t want to go  backwards. Plus I hate that my life  revolved around cigarettes. Where am I going to have one. Do I have enough to last. When are they leaving so I can go smoke etc etc. Edited July 23 by Diane R

Never go back - it's too hard to get to where you are now. Moving forward is the only logical plan
That’s an  understatement lol. My hubby is sick of me right now. I have been very grumpy. And everything gets on my nerves lol. But I have started enjoying the pool every afternoon. And a few white claws.  That’s hard seltzer in case anyone hasn’t heard of them before they are delicious and only 2 carbohydrates. It’s a win win for me!Edited July 23 by Diane R
    ^^^ Rewards ARE important after all  Good for you - enjoy!
Congratulations Diane!  I know that first week was really tough but keep up the great work!   You are doing great!       Edited July 23 by johnny5
Thanks again everyone. This forum has been a huge help to me. It’s a great place to  educate. And also to vent and get good advise. I know without a  doubt  it would’ve been much harder if I didn’t have the forum  to go to. Edited July 23 by Diane R
    You are on your way now Diane.  Once the tough week is over, you can conquer the craves.    We love helping you achieve your freedom.  It is exciting for us, as it is for you.     Keep that quit going!!!!!!! 
        Here's another badge and yay you!
    You did it!!!! Great Job!!!
    You are awesome, Diane !!!   
    Nicely done @Diane R!!!
Ankush thank you 2 weeks now  yippee!
    Love these badges lol
Congrats on 2 weeks, Diane.
Thanks MLML. It feels wonderful to be smoke free 2 weeks. And I’m feeling a lot better too. Still having  insomnia and a little short of breath if I do a lot. But there are so many more  positives.
    Glad you feel so much better Diane. Mention and celebrated the positives as often as possible, it wil help you build a solid quit :). 
    Look at those numbers @Diane R!! Keep up the fight!!!
    Two weeks is splendid progress. You are doing great, Diane. Remember to reward yourself for every crave/trigger conquered.
    Yay Diane, two weeks is awesome! 
    Halfway through your first month, Diane!  How fabulous it that?  Very.      Glad to hear you're feeling better already.  Congratulations and keep up the great work.     
    Thanks everyone. Went to dinner last night as a reward. Hope everyone has a great Monday. I have my granddaughter coming over in a little while to spend the night. Her and I will be doing girly things this afternoon!
And this visit Gramma won't need to slip away every half hour or so to go have a smoke!     Great work Diane! Congrats on 2 weeks

Congrats Diane on your first week over and done...... Here's to week 2..
Thanks everyone. My granddaughter is watching her show. Her words lol. She very busy lol. She 5 going on 30. So funny. She heard me tell her mom I quit smoking and she said now nana you don’t have to go smoke anymore. I certainly don’t want her to pick it up ever. Another good reason to quit and stay quit!

    She happy I have more time to do things with her. My grandson is older and he hates smoking. He very happy I don’t smoke. He doesn’t want me to die from it. 
    Great job Diane. I used another app that gave me badges and told me the health improvements I was achieving. I too found it motivating.     Keep up the good work. You’re doing this!
    I am so glad you are beginning to reap the rewards of being smoke free. The gifts will continue and expand.  Learning to live free is v. exciting.      It was only after I quit that I realized how living creatures around me were truly affected by my addiction.    My denial ran v. deep.   
    Congrats Diane  
    Sazerac I think everyone’s denial runs very deep. An addict will, say or do anything to get their fix. Ours just happens to be a legal drug. Every time I am doing something that I would have a cigarette after I say I don’t smoke. And I say it out loud. It seems to be working for me, at least for now. I want to get that mindset  instilled in my brain.

    Nice positive outlook towards your quit @Diane R , you seem happy with your quit and that is also important. Smile a lot and think "How awesome, I quit, I quit smoking!!!"
Ankush I’m very happy with my quit. I planned for it and waited until our family vacation was over. I didn’t think 7 grandkids 3 of ours kids and their spouses would be a good time to quit. We have a couple of grandsons that are hard to handle. Always into something lol. I started my Chantix the Monday we got back. So I was prepared for this quit. Hope you quit is going good.
@Diane R So far, my quit is fine.
    Hi everyone I just wanted to check in and say Hi.  I don't get a chance to be here often but I do have time now.  So I wanted to say Hi, keep fighting the good fight,  IT IS SO WORTH IT!!!    Don't let anyone or anything come between you and your quit!!!! I'm feeling better today, learning how to live a non smoker is FABULOUS!!!!!  I'm just enjoying the ride!!! It hasn't always been like this but for today it is!! So for anyone who is feeling ? Hold your head up because YOU ARE WINNING!!! every day that you say no to smoking you are WINNING!!!!!
    Great to hear from you QueenB and so happy that your quit is going strong!!!!

@QueenB Nice of you to check in on us and give us an update on your quit. I'm glad to know that you're doing well in your quit and off course, thank you for motivating us to keep our quits going!!!
    Here is a vid from our friend, Joel, about the consequences of relapse. We think we have all the time in the world but, we don't.   If you have quit, protect your quit with your life. Quitting IS about Life and Death         
    Should have watched this before I blew my quit today afternoon. I had forgotten I had seen it before during the early days of my first quit. Should have just gone through Joel's channel again. Should not have gotten impulsive and gone for a cigarette. I'm going to have another go at my quit. I haven't had a smoke after today afternoon and I'm not going to either. Set a quit date for tomorrow.
    Oh, Ankush, I am so sorry you chose to smoke.   Why wait to quit ?  It will just make it harder the more brain receptors you loose to nicotine !    Just quit NOW.  We are on your side !        
@Sazerac I chose a quit date for tomorrow because I already had that one cigarette today afternoon. While I have not had a cigarette after and will not have either, I have to set the quit date for tomorrow since I already had one today, just to make the quit date more accurate. I'm doing OK as far as withdrawal goes (I am not experiencing withdrawal so far). That cigarette didn't even give me the kind of kick it used to, just left a bad taste in my mouth, with only 2 minutes of relief, which I could've as well got if I had just tried to calm myself down (I was in a fit of rage at the time). So, the cigarette was pointless.Edited July 26 by Ankush
Ahw shit, no! I am really sorry to hear that. You had a great quit going and you are such a steady factor here..        Please muster up courage and cary on with your quit. Strong decision you made about that. The date is just a date, as much as I understand your need to make it accurate.  What matters most, obviously,  is that you dont light up again.      Please, please call out to us tonight/today, when you do experience withdrawl. Theres a great chance you will, since you administered nicotine to your system.               Edited July 26 by MLMR

NOPE your way through this, it is the only salvation.
@MLMR Thank you for encouraging me. I will carry on with my quit. I realized though, from my experience with my quit last time, that I had found the quitting process easy but staying quit was becoming increasingly difficult due to other factors. Moreover, I may have become a bit complacent without realizing it. So, I'm spending some time watching some of Joel's videos again, including the one on complacency. I just couldn't help myself, I flew in a fit of rage, became impulsive and ran out to buy the cigarette. Big mistake.
@Sazerac Yup, I will YUP to NOPE (if that makes sense)
    Here is Joel's vid on Complacency that @Ankush mentioned.    
    Sorry to hear you relapsed Ankush. You were doing really well and had gathered a lot of valuable information about smoking. You have now learned another important thing. It's not worth disrupting your quit with a cigarette for any reason. I hope you keep this lesson top of mind as you move forward with the start of your new quit. You will no doubt face a similar situation at some point in the future so you will need to rely on this experience at some point to avoid the same result. Welcome back fellow quitter  
    Sorry you relapsed Ankush but even more I'm sorry you didn't come here and allow us to help you through the crave that caused you to smoke. You are such a supporter here so you know the importance of our community and fighting this addiction.  I would also suggest making a ticker for your signature. Looking at that everyday shows you just how much time, money and cigs not smoked you've accumulated and also shows you what you will lose should you relapse.  Glad you're back on your quit and fyi, your quit starts the moment you put out that last cigarette
@reciprocity Well, I'm hoping I don't face any more situations like the one I faced this afternoon.Edited July 26 by Ankush
@jillar I tried making a ticker, however, the ticker doesn't support Indian Rupees. I then tried converting Indian Rupees to Dollars or Euros, but I just got an error saying that the amount was too small or something like that. Don't remember what the exact error was. 
1 USD = 68.9 INR    1 INR = 0.0145127 USD

(NTAP).  It does not matter what may happen on any day in your life......as long as you maintain in a conscious manner The Proper Sequence dynamic as a primary element of your quit, you will not smoke.    The Proper Sequence is: YOU --> QUIT --> LIFE.  •NOT•:  YOU --> LIFE --> QUIT.  By maintaining this simple sequence dynamic in your quit, you will not ever have your quit influenced by life events.       If you always keep your quit close to you,  protecting it with your commitment to Never.Take.Another.Puff (NTAP), you will never, *EVER*, smoke again.      We build our quits, and train our minds, our emotions, and our spirits to live as non-smokers in beautiful freedomby continuing to commit to NTAP. as our way of not smoking, and our way of slowly putting this awful addiction to sleep.  Consciously adding The Proper Sequence dynamic to your new non-smoker identity will strengthen your quit even more.         Cristóbal    Edited July 26 by Sazerac
@Sazerac You are correct that life from time to time throws challenges at us, but it's the petty challenges that I face that get to me.Thank you for that post. We must indeed keep our quits and our lives separate. Its difficult to do so though, since our lives were so mixed up with smoking when we were smokers.Edited July 26 by Ankush
@Jordan7 Just tried creating the ticker again. The error I get is "Please select a value that is no less than 1"
How much do you pay for a pack of 20 cigarettes in Indian Rupees?  Divide that amount by 68.9 (or 69) and that will give you the conversion to USD.  According to Google the average price of a 20 cigarette pack in India is the equivalent of roughly 4 USD.  How many did you smoke per day on average?   If you smoked less that 5 a day the cost would be less than $1, so that could be why you are getting the error message.
    This is sadness indeed ...I was rooting for you Ankush....and willing you on ....   Life will always throw us curve balls....all you can do is learn by this ....   Please post a SOS ,should you get angry enough to smoke ,with your next Fabulous quit...    Glad your jumping right back on !!!!!
@Ankush, sorry to hear.  But also glad that you're back at it.  A lot of folks require more than 1 attempt.     Do use the SOS in future - folks will jump in to support you.  You really need to get past the minute or 2 of intense craving and that's where the support helps you.       Don't let cigs be the boss of you.
    I'm really sorry to hear this, Ankush.  I'm glad you are quitting again, though.        Complacency can be rough but you must commit to never taking another puff.      Reach out if temptation like this arises again by posting an SOS.  We all want to see you succeed.
    How are you doing @Ankush?   
@Jordan7 Yes, that's why I get the error. The cost of cigarettes also depends on the brand. I was using the brand with the lowest cost. In addition to this, the quantity I used to smoke sometimes varied on a day to day and month to month basis. At the time of my first quit, it was around 3-4 cigarettes a day which cost me around 16 rupees a day.@Doreensfree Thank you. I am indeed back to being quit. Took the NOPE pledge as soon as I logged on to QuitTrain@d2e8b8 Yes, I won't let cigs be the boss of me. I will be the boss of them and since they are nothing but unhealthy ruin, they are fired.@johnny5 Yes, I shouldn't have become complacent, I'm back on track with my quit.
@MLMR Thank you for checking up on me. Keeping that quit going. It's a pain though to have to start from scratch all over again. I guess its a million times better than being a smoker again though.
    Well first ...Well done ....you are strong ..you just got back up.....that takes guts and strength my friend ...    I had a punching pillow when I first quit ...I put a face in it with a permanent marker...not saying who,s face it was ...  When I got angry over something ...I used to punch that pillow ,so hard ,it would go flying across the room.    Shouting NOPE...    It sure helped at the time ....just sayin !!!!!  
@Doreensfree I still have those post-its all over my room that say "Never Take Another Puff". Yet, I relapsed yesterday. Probably shows that no matter what I try, Nicodemon can come back, I have to still learn to be smarter than the cigarettes.

@Ankush well done. I agree with Doreen, it takes guts and strength to get back up. You inspire me by doing that.        You will get there, I am sure of that!       
@Jordan7 Yes, that's a good point. I calculated though (manually), I have spent approximately $9500 on cigarettes till date and smoked around 40880. What a profound waste. If I hadn't started smoking and had saved the amount of money I spent on cigarettes everyday little by little, I would have been able to buy the used car I always wanted around 10 years ago. The car isn't even available anymore in the used car market. Also my estimate of how much I've spent on cigarettes is most likely very skewed because the price of cigarettes has changed over the years as have my brands and their respective prices as well.@MLMR Thank you for encouraging me Edited July 27 by Ankush
Great work Ankush! As others have said, takes courage to get up, put your mistake behind you and carry right on with your quit! I think you should change your quit date back to 7-26-2019 though. Your last cigarette was on that date so that is your quit date.
@reciprocity Yes, but I had a cigarette. Having the cigarette doesn't make it a quit date for me, its the date I relapsed. So the day's damage is done. I am taking 27th as the quit date because starting today (again), I have not had a smoke. So yesterday was like a relapse day, and today is the quit day since starting today (again), no smoking.
    That's fine Ankush. I understand your point of view on this - just glad you are quit again. That's the important part  
I am so glad you jumped back on the train, @Ankush, You are an important member here and I look forward to all your posts.      You are so supportive of others quitting and very clear about your journey. How are you feeling ?   Having withdrawal symptoms ?    or ?Edited July 27 by Sazerac
    Good job on getting back to the quit, Ankush.  You can do this!
    Congratulations on wasting no time in restarting your quit.   I’ve been there.  It is frustrating, infuriating & heartbreaking.   I’ve frequently seen you around here. Now more than ever- stay close.         Life will come around and punch us in the face no matter what stage we are in our quit.   Knowing this, make a plan on how to deal with crap that will thrown next time. A plan that doesn’t involve smoking.   A plan that makes you better & stronger.
Thank you @reciprocity and @johnny5
@Sazerac Oddly enough, no withdrawal symptoms so far, and that's a good thing. Just finished exercising, having a nice bath and taking the dogs out for their toilet. Had plenty of water. 
@Lust4Life I know life has its challenges, its the petty challenges that I don't like.
    I'm rooting for you Ankush.....you can do it ...you just need to want freedom bad enough ...

Smoking leaves lasting marks on DNA, study saysBy Maureen Salamon   |        TUESDAY, Sept. 20, 2016 -- Smoking cigarettes can leave a lasting imprint on human DNA, altering more than 7,000 genes in ways that may contribute to the development of smoking-related diseases, a new study says.Reviewing results from blood samples taken from nearly 16,000 people in 16 prior studies, the researchers also found that for those who stopped smoking, most genes "recovered" within five years of quitting.  "Although this emphasizes the long-term residual effects of smoking, the good news is the sooner you can stop smoking, the better off you are,"said study author Dr. Stephanie London. She is deputy chief of the epidemiology branch of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.  Even so, London's team found that some genetic changes remained, even 30 years after quitting smoking.London and her colleagues zeroed in on a process called DNA methylation -- genetic changes that don't alter genes' underlying code but can change how they're expressed, or turned on.    Known to contribute to an array of health problems including cancer, heart disease and stroke, cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 6 million deaths each year, according to the study.    Even decades after smokers quit, the habit confers the possibility of long-term risk of disease. DNA methylation changes have been proposed as one possible reason for this.London's team compared DNA methylation sites in current and former smokers to those who never smoked.   In addition to finding that smoking-related DNA sites were linked with more than 7,000 genes -- about one-third of known human genes -- the researchers learned that some DNA methylation sites persisted even three decades after quitting.    Identifying these smoking-related DNA changes may lead to diagnostic tests that can more accurately evaluate a patient's smoking history, London said."We could use this type of data to estimate people's previous smoking," she said. "No one says they smoke when they don't, but they say they don't smoke when they do, so we could use these signals to find that out."   This information could also be useful for better identifying the health effects of a person's smoking history, London said. And it offers the possibility of developing potential new treatments to repair DNA methylation sites, she said."There's almost no time this information isn't useful," London explained. "Especially with a smoking-related condition, if you have an excellent biomarker of smoking, it allows you to pinpoint the effects of other exposures in a more rigorous way."     The study was published Sept. 20 in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Genetics.Dr. Norman Edelman is senior scientific advisor for the American Lung Association.     He said the new research "raises some tantalizing issues" despite not being able to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship between smoking-related genetic changes and resulting health problems.  "Those of us who deal with smoking as a public health problem understand ...that anything you look at seems to be affected by smoking," he said. "Many cancers, bone disease, lung disease, heart disease, [gastrointestinal] problems -- smoking has such a wide array of effects, it's not especially surprising to hear its epigenetic effects.  "The message here is that smoking has an enormous, widespread impact on your genes," Edelman added. "Most of it is reversible, but some is not. So if you smoke, you're going to alter your genetic makeup in a way that's not totally reversible."     More information   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers information on the health effects of cigarette smoking.Copyright © 2016 HealthDay.

    found this post,  way back in the crypt
    This is depressing
    Scary stuff.
    Thanks for sharing Sazerac. I had no idea they could quantify with a biological marker how long someone had smoked and the recovery from that insult to the human body. I used to justify that smoking was 'my only vice'... But it was like playing Russian roulette.   
Here is an article from June 2017 from Science Daily that goes into more depth. I also edited the link into the original post above.     Where cigarette smoking's damage is done -- down to your DNA        Edited April 24, 2018 by Sazerac

@Sazerac Nice post
    Ok, that was just to get your attention....     My sister is going to quit smoking - she just started Chantix.      She has the normal fears, alright....she's scared out of her wits.      She calls me with her new "fear" OR "I was wondering..."        I am able to give her an intelligent answer! Imagine that????       I guess two and a half years of reading, reading & more reading not only helped me but just might help my sister reach her sticky quit.  KTQ
    That's AWESOME beazel, I'm so happy for you and your sis  We're here if she needs some extra support   
I’m using Chantix to quit today is 7 days of no smoking. Chantix works I didn’t set a quit date but by week 3 I was ready to just quit. Make sure she take the Chantix after she has a meal and drink the 8 ounces of water or the  nausea is awful. But I found if I wait 10 to 15 minutes after I ate I didn’t get the sour  stomach so bad. Tell her good luck!
    This is great news B !
    I'm sure you have told her all about solid support being a great quit tool so perhaps we'll see her around the forum   Lots of love & respect for quitters around here!
    That's awesome, Beazel!  I hope to see her around here.      
    I will tell her there is a train full of amazing folks to support her! Thank you.
    You can also tell her that you're a quit smoking celebrity and are known nationwide. She must do as you say. 
    Great news...   There are plenty of empty seats...
    Great news, wishing success for your sister.
    That’s a mighty fine compliment to you beazel!  Show her the way!  The seas are scary but you’re an experienced Captain and will steer her to smobriety!!   We all will! 
    ....put something in my mouth and set it on fire....
    It's not an option.
No you don’t want to do that. Every time I think about a cigarette I remember how awful I felt the first few days. You’ve got 3 days over with just 1 day at a time.
    Excellent choice -- Great commitment!!!
    Good for you Michelle.   You are doing great.   
    That's how it's done ...repeat tomorrow.!!!!    Way to go Michelle...
    Thanks all. I'm trying to go without a patch today. I just want to get the nicotine out of my system. I may have three days but the nicotine is still in my system.....Today has been one long craving for hours at a time and its making me crazy
    Good move - it might be tough but you can be tougher.  Remember the deep breathing and cold water/juice maybe a hard candy or two and stay close to the site -- keep focused  and you can do this!!!
I understand you wanting to get the nicotine out of your system but I'm afraid with your history of relapses this may not be a great idea. There is no shame in using NRT's so please, if you feel your quit is in jeopardy, put a patch on. XoxoEdited July 24 by jillarDamn autocorrect 😠
    I am an advocate of cold turkey.    It is quicker, safer, cheaper and statistically more successful than many methods.      This doesn't mean other methods are doomed to failure,  All Quits are a Good Quit.      All you must do is stand by your commitment to Never Take Another Puff. NOPE your way through.  (or pretzel your way through, lol)      If you want to quit nicotine then stop administering the drug.  Try Oxygen. If you are fooling yourself and setting yourself up for a relapse by removing patches and taking up cold turkey,    you know that in your heart of hearts.  Don't blame cold turkey for relapse.    Relapse is pre-meditated.  You must procure a smoke and light it. Don't do it.
@MichelleDoesntSmokeAnymore Try writing it on you hand, every time you look at your hand in anticipation for a smoke, what you've written may help you back away from smoking. Just a suggestion...
    And a good one! Thanks Ankush!
    Whatever it takes to stay quit... Do it .....whatever works for you...Do it Just stay determined 
For me personally and what I have seen, I reflect on the word "Struggle" . . .      To watch a loved one die from cancer while all you can see is the whites of their eyes.

You definitely have great wisdom to share.  I am so glad you have found us.

And I totally understand the struggles during such a time.  Not long ago, I have experienced a life changing event in a hospital environment.  Two loved ones (a young couple), being good samaritans, pulled over to help someone in need. But instead, they were both struck by a vehicle. During their time in the hospital, I often had to step outside to get fresh air, to clear my mind, to grieve (one loved one passed away) . . . And at those times I saw patients, and staff, standing in the freezing cold, having a smoke.  I could not wrap my head around the fact that watching them, sucking on a cancer stick, they were endangering their own lives . . . while at the same time our loved ones struggled to survive. And I will never forget the irony of seeing the staff taking a smoke break, since after they were done, they were the same people who desperately worked at saving our loved ones.  A horrible journey for us, and a lesson of how precious life is and yet, how fragile.  You did well not giving in Linda . . . stay strong, for yourself, and for your Dad.
    Peter,  I am sorry for your loss also.  Such a heartbreaking situation.  Thank you so much for sharing it in a way that it will help others.

in the 70s, cigarette smoke didn't smell of chemicals? I grew up in a house with three adults smokers and while the smoke was unpleasant and irritating to my nose and lungs as a child, I don't remember the chemical smell they have today. Someone can light one two blocks away and you can smell it.
    I smoked for years and did not realize the chemicals that were in cigarettes.  I came from a nonsmoking home.  I don't think I could make that distinction.  
    You are becoming more aware of the smell that cigarettes produce when you get away from them even a short while.  I think I was just completely accustomed to the smell that smoking created (I also grew up in a household of smokers)!!! 
Thanks for the reply but no, thats not it...I noticed this several years ago. I started reading up on it after I posted this...sounds like the tobacco industry started adding things to them to make them more addictive, starting in the 90s.
    Very well could be, I know that possibly there had been something about that in the news many years ago though I never saw something final on that.  I have really never noticed anything different about the odor of cigarettes other than I cannot stand the smell of them now !!!!!

Oh they started putting  additives in cigarettes to make them more addicting in the 60s or 70s. I watched a video on that some time ago. Might have been hbo  documentary. I can’t remember. My father smoked so I never noticed the smell til I was much older. But even when I smoked I could smell it if I entered a place that  allowed smoking. Now I can really smell it.
    I think you're just more sensitive to it now that you're a non-smoker. I rarely used to notice cigarette smoke back when I smoked. Now I smell it everywhere. I can smell it when on my motorcycle on the freeway.  It's pretty gross.
I can remember smoking on airplanes!  They had a "smoking section" and a "nonsmoking section".  As if cigarette smoke knew not to travel beyond row 20      I'm actually amazed at how keenly I can smell stale smoke on a person who has just had one. That really stinks to me. The actual smell of someone smoking a cigarette, I don't mind as long as they aren't blowing it in my face.Edited July 23 by reciprocity

This is true..they added more chemicals to keep folk hooked ,when more people started Quitting...   This is why quitted is harder..There is so much more chemicals now ,then when our parents  smoked ..
Around 2004, I started getting sinus infections out of nowhere.  As time went on, they increased in frequency and duration.  Sometimes I had to be on antibiotics long term to get rid of it.  I almost always had a sinus infection.  It was a miserable way to live.  Fast forward to 2013, I saw an ENT.  Last April, I had a septoplasty, turbinectomy, concha bullosa re-section and sinus surgery on my ethmoid and maxillary sinus cavities.  While I could breathe better and the sinus infections weren't as bad, I still got them.  The doctor told me smoking was probably the culprit.  Yeah right, I thought.  A couple months later, I quit during a sinus infection.  I have had one sinus infection since then, just one.  Coincidence?  I think not  :)
Apparent additional blood flow to excitable areas.
Mine was how much I can smell and taste everything so differently and how much I smell better, the downside I can smell horrid smells better too, especially stale smoke on people Its all been positive though and continues to be :)
So happy to hear you aren't getting them as much Colleen! Sinus infections are brutal.  Tracey, I'm the same way. I can smell everything, good and bad. Sometimes I wish I couldn't smell as good as I do, lol. People stink!

I got taller, smarter and better looking. Google began asking me questions and the most interesting man in the world applauds to my stories. 
I got taller, smarter and better looking. Google began asking me questions and the most interesting man in the world applauds to my stories.wake up Bakon ...you overslept :-)
I think I smile every night in my sleep. I had bad smokers cough (of course it wasn't from smoking..it was a sinus problem). I am a side sleeper and sometimes when I rolled over I started coughing and it woke me up. The coughing continued and I had to sit up and drink a glass of water. Now I sleep silently...I can toss and turn (not that I want to) there won't be any coughing involved :-)
It wasn't a cough. It was a pillow being placed over your face and I quit because I moved under someone else's bedBoogieman
I know this is going to sound stupid. The question was about "unexpected benefits" ......and some people's top reasons for quitting was the financial cost. I seriously never considered how much $10.50 could add up. These days, I have handfuls of change in my pockets, my purse, the cup holder in my car. And get this: it stays there! For days...weeks even!! Plus, here in Canada we don't have paper bills for $1 and $2 we have coins so "change" can really add up. I probably have $30 in my car cup holder that never would have been there if I was smoking. Every single time my 16yr old has asked me for money in the last 2 months, I've had it. Now.....I think I'll go clean out my cup holder and pockets and buy a treat :)
CanadiN quarters end up here at the time. Got to be Canuck fans can't see difference after couple of iron city beers. 
I was thinking the same thing- money actually stays in my wallet the other day I looked there was $50.00  few days later still$50.00 until yesterday I spent it- not on cigarettes though.
Having extra money in your pocket is definitely a good thing!
Having extra money in your pocket is definitely a good thing!More money for cheese. :)I picked up a piece of 7yr old white cheddar today. :)I dont even have to hide it in the fridge because the people in my house wouldnt touch 7yr old food......they think its gross. Mind you....they eat cheez whiz and processed cheese slices. Something wrong with them :)
Ok, you said unexpected, I expected money, no cough, feeling better and I continue to be delighted with those things. Unexpected was that cough after "ya know" where you had to hold the cough in otherwise you'd eject his "ya know" and now I don't...so that's an unexpected benefit lol.
Mmmm,what beniefts.....Oh ya having my two feet ,to do the shuffle.....feels good 
I met a lot of people willing to help and guide me, to entertain me, to make me feel their struggle, to listen to me, to count with me, to kill extra time I suddenly had, to reassure me, and to celebrate my milestones as I celebrated theirs.  I will probably never meet any of you but quitting has brought me the unexpected benefit of your company.  Quitting has a lot of benefits and it can include new friends that understand what you are what you are trying to do.  I care for all of you.

He also started vigorous excersize and radically altered his diet at virtually the same time (within 2 or 3 months) of quitting smoking. Could have been quitting. Could have been diet. Could have been all of the above. Who knows?? He didn't expect any of those up there ^^^ but there were a metric crap-ton that were expected that actually showed up, too[1].   Easy Peasy  FOOTNOTE:[1] The classic "better boners via nicotine cessation" is Mrs. Sarge's favorite    :o EDIT: Grammar 'n stuff.

Yup in September
Yup in SeptemberWe'll look at you poppa jingle!! Congrats!! Babies are da best!! :) 
No more putting out fires in the back seat of my car. That's a big plus!
1.The sheer empowerment of being in charge. I used to do exactly what my addiction told me, when it told me. Now when it gives an order, I laugh at it and tell it where to go. 2. Time. I was spending three hours plus smoking. In the modern age, this smoking was done in specified smoking areas. Give or take, smoking was filling 20%+ of my waking hours. Just smoking. 3. You bunch of lunatics. :D
Awww congrats on the baby Jengels, that's fabulous news!
Yup in SeptemberCongratulations! 
No more chronic chapped lips. Seriously painful chapped lips. Who knew?Life long insomnia pretty much gone.And, yeah. . .only one burn hole in the new car I got in September. The trade in had, um, a few more than that.No more chronic cough.Cleaner teeth and mouth.
Yup in September Congratulations!

No more putting out fires in the back seat of my car. That's a big plus!OMG, I had completely forgot about that.  I've had one brand new car my whole life.  In the first two weeks of owning it, I threw my ciggy out the window (so I wouldn't get the brand new ash tray dirty) and it flew back in on the back seat.  I didn't realize it at first.  Huge burn hole and I cried for days.  It still makes me feel sick to think about it. 
I used to have sinus and bronchial infections also. After I quit I had a septoplasty and as a result of the ENT MD consultation I had a sleep study done. That put me on CPAP. Apparently was stopping breathing anywhere from 10 s to 45 seconds per minute of every hour that I slept. So sinus infections are a lot less maybe once or twice a year always during flu season, sleep is great, and not walking around like a zombie half the time or sleeping 12-14 hours a night on weekends trying to bank some sleep.
Several for me One of my main motivations for giving up smoking was that I had spotted the start of smoking wrinkles on my face.  That was the clincher for me.  I didn't want any more.  Within weeks of stopping my face started to lose that pale greyish colour and the skin looked much fresher and pinker.   Other things:  Much better circulation in my fingers and toes.   No more rotten sinus infections. No more embarrassing coughing fits whilst laughing at something funny.    Much healthier gums.   No more smelly clothes or car.  My car is 12 months old and someone got in it the other day and said.  Wow I love that new car smell  :) Millie x
Found this way back in the library stacks. I share most of the above benefits (well, other than Fertility thank you but, Please No thank you). The major benefit for me is a deep level of inner strength I never knew existed.It is more than 'strength', it has notes of compassion and understanding and more facets that I cannot articulate yet.I also have a grand sense of Freedom.It is Delicious.
The mental peace, that it was finally over, and I knew this was finally it and would never have to do it again. The current mental peace, three years on, that I would no more want to smoke than I would stick my fingers in a deep fat fryer. Given me an enormous sense on mental peace, finally.
Really good to see you Sharon...xx
Really good to see you Sharon...xxThank you Doreen, I'm on FB, are you? Be nice to keep up to date with you xx Reminds me of another unexpected benefit! Can spend more time on my addiction I will never overcome, my addiction to Tenerife and spending lots of time on the Tenerife FB page. 
Took about twenty years to pay off the mortgage and other encumbrances.  I am DEBT FREE. The same with smoking.  I am my own man.   I am SMOKE FREE. Not certain what that means but I sure as hell know what it doesn't mean.    I don't bend my knee to the Nicodemon   Never again.  Not one puff. oh yeah, I don't snore anymore.  That was cool.

I don't know about everyone else but since I quit there have been times when the temptation to smoke has been strong and I have had a few quotes that have got me through... this is probably the main one, not in Aussie Rules states of Australia this is a pretty famous speech.. it was made by the coach of Hawthorn during the 1989 AFL Grandfinal and I actually hear this in his voice... so if you listen from the 100sec mark you get the best bits... I just apply the word quit in my head wherever he says game.... but these are the words that at the lowest of the low I hear in my head:        "In every (quit) game there is going to be a crossroad, and when you get to that crossroad, you either step up, or step you down. It is entirely all up to you. You make the decision, not me."
I too had/have special quotes that I turned to when I was having hard times. One of my favorite was 'Nothing Worthwhile comes easily'. I had it as my title so I would read it everyday Edited June 30, 2018 by jillarAuto correct changed easily to radios lol
    Nice post NSJ. I don’t have inspirational quotes but I remember how sh*t difficult it was to stop smoking. If I get a thought to smoke, I ask myself if I want to do that quitting thing again and I say NOPE. I then ask myself if I want emphasymia, COPD, lung cancer, be dependent and useless and I say NOPE! I then get pretty inspired to stick with my NOPE! 
I hear ya, mine was a bit of a song. I heard it on the radio on day one of my quit and I sung it more than once daily for at the very least the first 3 months...       Thank you Hue and Cry       It's the 3rd verse and it kicks in at 2.13  Feel free to boogie on down to the rest of the song too         "I can't stand it, I said I just don't want it  Never gonna need it, anyway yeah    I can't stand it, I said I just don't want it   Never gonna need it, anyway I don't want you, I don't need you  I don't need your tricks and treats I don't need your ministration, your bad determination  I've had enough of you, and your super-bad crew I don't need your, I don't need your    Pseudo-satisfaction baby    I can't stand it, I said I just don't want it   Never gonna need it, anyway yeah    I can't stand it, I don't want it   I don't need your pseudo-satisfaction baby"     Every time sung with passion though the further into my quit I cut it down to "don't want it don't need it NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE."
I am not big into motivational speakers or "positive figures" because they speak all eloquent and intelligent and stuff but then it is found out later they were involved with human trafficking or some other vile action.     My motivational quote when i find myself wanting a smoke is -   No, screw that s***. By the time i get to the store, the craving will have passed anyways".     And here is a motivational tear jerker, get ready for the slow-clap -   People are going to die of smoking related illnesses. Let it not be me, but to be someone else who DOESN'T have the discipline to quit smoking.Edited July 1, 2018 by Jetblack
    We all draw motivation from that place that works for us and we all have different places. This is another one that comes up time and again not just recently but throughout my life it is from a poem my Grandad learned at school that he wrote in his war diary to help him through the rough times...       If the day looks kinder gloomy, An' your chances kinder slim!   If the situation's puzzlin' An' the prospect's awful grim,  An' perplexities keep pressin'  Till all hope is nearly gone,Jus' bristle up an' grit your teeth    An' keep on keepin' on.
    The world is cruel and life is a joke. You gotta be relentless. Theres no other way around, you gotta be gangsta in this life to survive.

        And another from Tommy Hafey (just doesn't feel the same having breakfast coffee down the beach without seeing this great man)...    
    This weekend has hit me hard in my quit journey.        I have felt so exhausted and out of my depth even in menial tasks. I have been sleeping on an off. Having horrible dreams (actually I should call them nightmares) Not sure if this is any side effect of the quit or general exhaustion, but each time I've even felt a slight need to smoke... I have read the poem "Invictus" which is part of my signature.     This poem really wakes up that last bit of strength, will power and resilience I have, and helps me get over the next few minutes, and then some. Next thing I know, the craving is just a blip on the radar.       The one line that I keep saying to myself from this poem is "In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under thebludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed." And it won't bow to the trickster that is Nicotine...ever.  Thanks for the lovely post Jo, just what I needed to pick myself up before facing the coming week.
@Tammy what you are going through is totally normal and won't last forever so just try to keep your head up and know that once you get past it you never have to do it again

I have read the poem "Invictus" which is part of my signature.             Fluctuations in mood and energy are more pronounced during the early stages of the quit.  It is important to bear in mind that these ups and downs are not entirely due to the quit.  Addiction does weird things to one's perception and distorts our memories.  When we quit, anytime we begin to feel a bit down our addicted minds offer up a false remembrance of a life free from challenging moments when we smoked.  Life wasn't all roses and rainbows when we smoked cigarettes, but our addicted minds will try to make that leap anyway.        This will pass Tammy.  You're doing great.
    Tammy...I was where you are once...and I reminder a wise quitter wrote to me....    Doreen ,its OK ,if you have a wobble now and again..just make sure you don't fall over and stay down... I still remember  those words ,almost five years on....your doing just fine....
    Yes Tammy. What you're experiencing is totally normal and to be expected. I remember having like a fogginess in my brain for a while in the early part of my quit. It is all temporary and you will emerge from your quit cocoon as a beautiful, smoke-free butterfly ready to live the rest of your life in good health and with more $$ in your wallet  Keep going girl!!
Ok so for the 100th anniversary of Nelson Mandela's birth... here are some of his words that help on this journey....

    So giving this a bump for @pottanramu .     But had to have read through, like ya do.... and OMG @Tammy .... look how far you have come..... you are a champion my friend, so super proud of you and your awesome quit.         Here are some new ones:          
With a bumpy start to November thought it might be best to give everyone some positives to think about... because its never smooth sailing 100% of the time, but what you do when the sea gets rough defines you... hang on my fellow quitters the rewards are worth the short term struggles... and they are short term, they pass, it gets easier and better...

JEEPERS!!!  There should be a WARNING in the title!!!!!! YUK


Awww... 727 xox You're a STAR!!!
Sarge is gonna be That Guy and say this: damage is done. Some of us, even though quit, will still suffer these horrors.  Salute and honors to JWG. A quit warrior who still died of lung cancer. I owe my quit and my life to you.  We are not immune because we quit.  We are at risk because we smoked. That is all.   Easy Peasy. 
To those that haven't quit yet or relapsed... you can still benefit from quitting... the Sarge did get to keep his teeth At the very least I get to breath a little easier for the time being... the damage is already done but I refuse to go as a smoker... RIP John  Peace Out  :wub:
Awww... 727 xox You're a STAR!!!Yup indeed... hugs xx
... the Sarge did get to keep his teeth  The Sarge has permanent bone loss and will lose his teeth a decade (or more) earlier than he would have had he not smoked.    Easy Peasy
damage IS done...but..no new damage...and not going down without a fight!  :)
You live and learn... The price I pay for trying to look "cool" many years ago...
I still worry about suffering these horrors three years after quitting. Here's to hoping we don't have to go through this. My teeth are also damaged... at 28. You live, you learn. NOPE!
Didn't Skip also die from Lung Cancer, that's the thing-YES we're doomed sooner then later BUT at least we might have bought us some good yrs. Like on  that video I saw an autospy on tv & saw all that gross fat coming out of that heart artery & that's what really did it for me-I quit for good 2 months later. So yes some of us will die soon but at least we quit. Better to quit then keep puffing & speed up the death clock. :dash2: :dash2:
Every day...myself  and my two feet are still together...it's  a bonus...amputation .....how close I came...What ever time I have left....who know,s....but I'm living it in one piece....
It's better to die after living the life we've CHOSEN rather than wasting precious time feeling restricted and financially stunted!!! I don't care when I die... I only wish I KNOW so I can 'plan'/make arrangements etc... but I now I can die in PEACE!!! no one to FIND all the smoking paraphernalia, and feeling cheated, lied to, disappointed and (in my sister's case only) more lost!!

    For some reason, this doesn’t bother me much. It didn’t bother me when I smoked, and it still doesn’t.  Denial? Perhaps.

Sometimes I think that was the way I dealt with it. The only one that ever upset me was the baby ones.
    *bump*
    I keep getting the feeling that "Something's missing" or that I want something. Not necessarily a smoke or a vape but.....something. But theres nothing to get or have. I could go back on the sweets but I really don't want to and besides there aren't any sweets in the house. My sister and brother in law don't have sweets in the house. Yargh. I've got my ice water, gum, toothpaste and mouthwash.        Motivation: My dear Michelle    You have abused and neglected your body for your entire life thus far. Its time to take care of yourself. Every time you resist reaching for that smoke, vape or unhealthy food, you are doing right by yourself and you should be grateful and proud. Smoking and/or vaping and/or eating junk food will only make you feel worse and set back your healthy lifestyle committment more. Remember how you get such a carb crash after eating sweets, how it makes you feel bad about yourself etc. Remember how you want to research things that will help your skin look more youthful, like Loris. Even if you can't erase the smoker's lines, you can halt them. Think about that friend of yours who's face looks like a roadmap. That is your future if you return to smoking. Don't be a fat old lady in a wheelchair on oxygen, still smoking and overeating. NOW IS THE TIME while you still have a chance. So if you don't think of your health, think of your appearence and the quality of life you are setting yourself up for.     I love you,     Michelle
    Love your motivation section -- awesome and will give you help in the future-- Keep strong and soon you will be able to fill that "something" feeling.  (and yes I had the same feelings)!!!
    Stay strong Michelle, you got this!
    I love your motivation also Michelle.  Keep  telling yourself all those things.  The rewards in quitting are immense.   I do think you should treat yourself a little though.  There must be something you like to do that you don't always leave time for.  Now is the time to pamper yourself. 
Or good afternoon, depending on where you are. I'm on PST so its 8:30am. I hope everyone is doing well! I sure am! Have a great, smoke-free day!
    You are doing great Michelle.  Glad to hear you getting through the tough days.     It is afternoon here.  Rainy day but a welcome relief of the heat we have been experiencing.  
I live in Sacramento aka "Hellfire Inferno" Its dry heat but I question if it matters when its 105.     Oh yeah, I was in Alabama during the hot season. It does.
    Move along, friends, nothing to see here.....
So I’m having a lot of fatigue, shortness of breath(never had this before) I’m a little grumpy. I understand I’m going to have withdrawal symptoms. Man they are hard to deal with. I keep telling myself they will pass. I need to be strong. I’m still taking the Chantix is does help but it doesn’t stop the craving or the withdrawals. I can’t wait for the fatigue to get better so I can go to the gym. I’m so tired I’m having a hard time getting anything done. I went on a little vacation with my girlfriends over the weekend and I was beat just taking a little walk. So not use to this. I like to stay busy and I’m usually an active person. Not so much the last 3 weeks. I have totally stop smoking as of yesterday. I was up til than only smoking 3 cigarettes if that a day. I’m hoping in a couple of days a lot of this will be totally gone.
    Hi Diane, what you are experiencing is totally normal. Your body is working hard to heal from all the damage smoking has done. So if it's tired, rest. Hungry, eat. Craving sweets, eat a candy or drink some fruit juice. Just let your body dictate what it needs right now.  Many of us experience shortness of breath after quitting. I have asthma and my breathing got so much worse I was questioning why I even quit! But, it does get better. To ease your worry though it's never a bad idea to talk to your dr. about it. My cousin quit and doesn't have asthma but her Dr. gave her a rescue inhaler to use for that first month or so. She's great now.   Congrats on being past day !  
    Thanks for the info jillar! It’s nice to have a place to just vent and get things on your chest. 
    I concur with Jillar -- there are several things you will go thru the first several days off of cigarettes.  The fatigue got to me a bit -- did not expect it, what I did was rest.  Again  drink lots of fluids -- cold if you can and use deep breathing techniques they really help.  Again check out the site and all of its information as it can really help you understand what is going on.  If anything seems really out of place it cannot hurt to discuss with your doctor.  Congrats on the first day!!!!
Shortness of breath, I had it too. Mine was anxiety related. Quitting scared the hell out of me. It lasted a while, diminished and came back again. Its a proces. Do some research to what causes it, maybe visit your doctor if you dont trust it. And try concious breathing. See it as an opportunity to learn something about yourself, rather than something that has to get out of the way!       Just to clarify, have you quit 'officially' now? If so, good for you, congrats on your decision          Edited July 16 by MLMR
    These symptoms can last a while during the early days of your quit. Be patient with the process, it's a marathon not a sprint race. You WILL heal but it takes some time regardless of who your are or how long you smoked. People above have given you some good ideas of things to try to relieve some of the issues. Glad you have put the smokes down all together because that's what is required not only to break free from your addiction but as well to get through all these early quit symptoms you are experiencing. Now that you are not smoking at all, the true healing can begin  
    Diane, so glad you are finally quit.  Hunker down and stay strong.  It will be difficult for the first couple of days but so worth it.      I did sleep a lot the first couple of days but I was glad to do so.  It helped avoid the other discomforts of quitting.  I was also crabby for a couple of months.  Stay close to the forum and we will help support you along the way.   
Yes I have  officially quit no cigarettes since yesterday. Not even a puff! Im really not feel deprived of smoking. I’m having the most trouble with the habit. I wasn’t getting anything from smoking for the last couple of weeks. I really think the habit and as dumb as it might sound fear of quitting smoking as been the worst. No one like to fail and I’m no exception. I’ve been reading a lot of others stories on here since I found the site. They have helped me more than I can tell you. I’m very thankful to all of you for sharing you experiences and stories.and I’m sure I will me posting a lot in the coming weeks and months.Edited July 16 by Diane R
Congratulations on the quit.  Two quick observations...     First, maybe think about trying to force yourself to go to the gym despite the fatigue.  Sometimes exercise can be an energy producer instead of an energy consumer, and you may feel better as a result of going.  Second, definitely don't be alarmed if your energy is not back to normal in a couple of days, as you mention in your initial post of this thread.  Recovery can be a long process--and given how long most of us smoked, the toxicity of the chemicals we've ingested, and the habits we've ingrained, it would actually be surprising if this weren't the case.  Cultivate patience.       Christian99 17 1/2 Years Quit

    My withdrawals are getting better. Still have a little fatigue. The  body aches are much better. Still have the worst headaches though. But it is getting better. I know when it’s all said and done I will feel great. 
    Good job Diane -- congrats on the past few days!!  It slowly gets better -- just remember to stay close.  Keep focused and strong!!!!!
    Thanks Martian I will stay close. Been on and off all day. And thinking about all the reason I have to stay a non smoker!
    You're doing awesome Diane, I had a bunch of quit withdrawals too including fatigue, extreme shortness of breath, bleeding gums and my tongue was so sore lol.  But I still remember the morning I woke up in the best mood I had been in in years and realized all that misery was worth it

Please pay attention to any symptoms.       This is from the FDA Drug Safety site,  "Patients taking Chantix should contact their health care professional  if they experience new or worsening symptoms of cardiovascular disease, such as chest pain, shortness of breath,    calf pain when walking, or sudden onset of weakness,    numbness, or difficulty speaking.   Patients should also contact their health care professional if they have any questions or concerns "        Here is more information from Chantix       Stay aware and alert.       I was so excited that you had quit, I forgot you were on Chantix.   There are more complicated things to be aware of with a drug like that. You may be experiencing things that have nothing to do with quitting smoking    and everything to do with taking Chantix.            Edited July 19 by Sazerac
Sazerac thanks for the info i’m  aware of the side effects of Chantix. I don’t have heart problems. I’ve reduced my Chantix I 1 day. I’m going to stop taking it in the next couple of weeks. I don’t think I need it for a full 3 months. I’m always aware of what’s going on with my body. I only have a little shortness of breath. No signs of a heart attack. I’m not sure if I  mentioned  I have type 1  diabetes. I was Diagnosed 3 years ago. I see doctors all the time. Just went to my doctor 1 week ago. No heart problems blood pressure is good. They keep a good eye on heart  disease as a diabetic I’m at a higher risk for it.
@Diane R, years ago I quit for three weeks using chantix and quit taking it after a month and almost instantly started smoking again. So I would really recommend staying on it for the suggested three months. I'm just speaking from experience.....
    Thanks jillar did you use it this time?
    No, this time I went cold turkey. My attitude wasn't very good on the chantix lol

I don’t think I need it for a full 3 months.              Hi Diane, I am no expert in Chantix, wouldnt know if thats the wisest thing to do (quit early). Like Jillar said, Ive also heard from people who went straight back to smoking after quitting the program early.        I went cold turkey, but I did have some time frame in mind. No worries about over-eating the first month, shifting focus to exercize only after 6 months (i tried walking daily though, from the 2nd month or so), making sure I celebrated every milestone and counting weeks on a calender. I wanted to have a grip on my first year and I was well aware of all the triggers/patterns (both daily, seasonal, mental and many others) to overcome. This time frame helped me a great deal. I am not one for NRT's, but I can imagine that the programs that often come with it, like with Champix or patches, can be helpful. Working towards something.      Do you have some kind of plan, or will you just go with the flow?
I have quit before. I just stayed busy and I did start going to the gym. I plan on that again. When I smoke I can’t do all the workouts I like. I love spin classes but no way you can do that and be a smoker. Of course I changed the place I went. In the  beginning I just made it hard to find places to smoke. That helps if I’m out having a few drinks with friends. Most of my friends don’t smoke. So that is helpful. Even when I smoke I don’t like the smell and I can always smell it. When I don’t smoke I can really smell everything so much better. I went out with a few friends that at the time where smokers and it was a bar you could smoke in. The is how I started again too many drinks and friends with cigarettes that didn’t talk me down. Today I don’t go out drinking like I did than. One I can’t drink like that now. I have type 1 diabetes. Two I’m 12 year older so out drinking like that doesn’t do it for me. I’ve made a lot of life style changes. So this is the last one. So I guess I’m just doing the things I know worked last time.
     
    Sazerac believe me I know it wasn’t a successful quit. I think I learned I can just a one. And I have no  intention on go though this again. No fun and I have better things to do with my time than put those nasty little needy things in my mouth again.          
    Lol wrong link but I like that one too       
    How are you doing @Diane R ?
    I’m doing good. Still smoke free. I still think about smoking of course but I’m able to find something esle to do instead.

    Hello all,  Please I need your help, support.   I want to quit again ... I’m struggling with making this decision, scared of making decision ... shall i do it now or tomorrow..?   I’ve done it several times before: each time was different. Sometimes it was a huge struggle sometimes easier .. Once i even thought: OK i am quitting the last time: if it works great, if it doesn’t ... let it be.. I was so tired of going through it, that I was ready to accept it if I had failed ..     but here I am and I don’t want to accept it ... it is so self- destructive .. so against the human nature .. I feel horrible.. i feel guilty, frustrated, and angry at myself ..        Just a thought of quitting makes me panic and make grab another one . ... just as if I wanted to store as much as possible in me ..     haha ... how absurd..       I had some good excuses why I started again .. but I know I didn’t have to - it was self pity or self distraction..         Please help me with starting ... and I will keep going ...  the words: "you can do it"  can do miracles..       all the best to all of you - keep on ..  
Welcome aboard Edy!!! You can quit smoking whenever you want to, but keep in mind that the sooner you quit, the better. Write down your reasons for quitting and keep the list of reasons to remind yourself why you quit. Also, think about why you went back to smoking and learn from past mistakes, so that you don't go back to smoking again. Take the NOPE pledge a day at a time. Post an SOS when you need to and stay close to the board. Here's the thread on posting an SOS:     https://www.quittrain.com/topic/8-posting-an-sos/      You will get plenty of good advice and motivation from the people on QuitTrain. All the best!!!Edited July 17 by Ankush
Welcome, Edy.       Forget about past experiences. Instead focus on the 'now'. Now is where you want (and can!) quit. It is doable, just as much for you, as for anyone else.       You ask, shall I quit today or shall I quit tomorrow? My advise would be, make up your own mind about that. Take matters into your own hands, it's empowering! Lean on us for support along the way, that's what the board is here for.     There is plenty to be scared of.. but, actually, there isn't. Because you will find your way and you will discover how strong you really are.       Let us know what you decide!         Edited July 17 by MLMR
    tomorrow ...    thank you both.. i am already totally stressed and irritated .. and feel that cribbeling  .. therefor i think it is regardless smoking .. and smoking may make it actually worse .. 
    You can do this Edy!!! The Addict in us is not going to let go willing!! We HAVE to fight!!! It is the ONLY way out!!!! Please reconsider your decision.  Decide not to decide for one hour
Edy, you must be willing to change  and you must be willing to honor the commitment to Not One Puff Ever (even just for NOW, one minute at a time). This is a commitment to yourself.  Quitting isn't that hard, it is just the addict's voice that is lying to you.    You Can Quit.  We quit !  Believe just a little bit.    I am glad you found us. Have a stroll through this thread 10 Ways To Effectively Use This Forum To Quit Smoking
    Edy welcome aboard.  Just focus on the here and now then make the commitment to quit -- one day at a time.  Then come here often to educate and socialize -- it will truly help!!!!!
    Welcome Edy, planning a quit date is stressful, especially once it arrives. That's why for me it worked better to prepare instead of plan. By that I mean I quit smoking in places I normally smoked. I also waited just a few minutes more from the regular times I normally smoked.   When the day did arrive that I decided not to buy anymore and just be done it made going into those areas and doing those things much easier. I didn't instantly crave a smoke. Glad you've decided to take back your life. We will be here as much as you need or want to help you  
        Quote               I had some good excuses why I started again             This is thinking you need to be rid of.
Anticipation is way worse than actually doing. That applies to most life situations you don't really want to do but know you must do. Jump in, all in and stay on the forum for education and support. That will help you. Quitting won't kill you but continuing to smoke just might. One day at a time my friend. It IS possible for anyone to quit!Edited July 18 by reciprocity

Welcome Edy.  I truly hope you decide to stay and start that quit.  You can feel your desperation in your post.     I smoked for 42 years and never felt that I could quit.  I was ashamed and afraid that I could not quit.  I finally found freedom on this forum.  You can too.  Just make the commitment.  We are here for you.

    Yaa eat to go Edy...    How you doing ?
     
Good morning/evening to all,    it is a day 4!  .. and I am actually doing good ...i am not struggling as much i did in the past..  which is strange..  it makes me feel:   - embarrassed: why was i postponing it for so long .. and was panicking about the quit      On 7/18/2019 at 1:31 AM, Boo said:              Anticipation and worry leading up to an event are often more troublesome than the event itself.         exactly!!       - embarrassed also because.. i am wondering why am i so privileged to have it easier than others ..  feeling sorry for others ..    - anxious that the addiction is not manifesting right now as expected and normal..  but it will hit me later when i am less cautious..  - as it is being a relatively easy quit .. i may just think .. oh.. i have no problem .. i can do it any time .. .. and will relapse again ..       today was actually somehow the hardest day so far .. more cravings and i felt like crying  ... not sure if it is due to quitting or life itself ..
Fantastic job on day 4 -- you are doing great.  Glad that you posted what you felt, hopefully it will help keep you focused and understand that the cravings can sneak up on you.  As to this being the hardest day just keep committed and if need be come back here especially if you need to post an SOS.  You are doing good -- pat yourself on the back!!!!
    Edy you are doing great.  I think the two are intertwined (life and quitting).  If things were going bad in my life,  I would be chain smoking.     As I look back on my quit journey, it does not seem so bad.  There were bad moments but wonderful support.  
    Congrats on day four Edy, that's great! 
13 hours ago, Edy said:             today was actually somehow the hardest day so far .. more cravings and i felt like crying  ... not sure if it is due to quitting or life itself ..          Quitting can produce similar effects to grieving a personal loss. Denial & isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance. Quitting is a huge life change so don't be concerned that your emotions are all over the place early on. Just focus on staying quit 1 hour at a time. Setting small goals will get you there in the end.
    You're doing great @Edy hang in there!!!!
    Each quit is different, Edy.    Be grateful you are having a relatively easy time   and stay vigilant.  You may have triggers that seem to come out of nowhere. NOPE your way through them, breathe your way through them and reward yourself for conquering them.  You are doing great.
    Stay on your guard ...that sneaky Nico Monster can spring up anytime ...
    ...I just caught a nice, deep, delicious breath, without having to try hard and concentrate!

    Fantastic -- and it only gets better day by day, hold on to that!!!!
Can someone tell me where it is? Cuz believe me I have a great picture LOLEdited July 21 by MichelleDoesntSmokeAnymoreaddding to it
    It is the first one in the Off The Record Forum If you are following me, I just posted there.
    It can be helpful when you quit, to imagine your quit like this:            This allegory is completely correct in every way possible that you can imagine what the reality of quitting smoking really is.      Of course the Grim Reaper is still a smoker.....and you are not any longer......so the longer you keep your quit the more faster you can run than him.          Cristóbal
    haw haw great post!
This morning I awoke and my first thoughts were about coffee and a cigarette.  Incredibly, I started rationalizing that maybe the worsening of my eyesight in my right eye was from something like eye strain, something temporary. I stepped back 20 feet from the eye sight testing chart I bought on Amazon and taped onto my door and tested my eyes. 20/70 at best with my right eye. No change with left eye. The results of the chart triggered a cascade of reasons I quit for.  I felt some relief that I could feel good about the improvements in my health that might be possible when I stay quit.         All the while I smoked in the past, I said to myself that, "my father was "healthy" and smoked since he was in his late teens"--and he was around 80-85 at the time. He got prostate cancer somewhere in there, but survived.  The irrational addictive thought was, "If I get cancer after 50 years of smoking, it' won't be a tragedy, it'll be a miracle!" (I'd be 120 years old.)  What an idiot.       My father had quit the moment he had the diagnosis and the doctor said, "quit or die." It wasn't until later that he was diagnosed with emphysema. I used to visit him most Sundays for an hour in the last few years of his life. I watched the disease take hold ever stronger and suffocate him. He was 91 when he passed away 10 months ago, his body like a skeleton with skin stretched over them -- emphysema made it difficult for him to eat anything in his last year.        Somewhere in my mind I was thinking, "I'll quit before any cancer or other disease becomes a problem." The darkening color of my toes in the winter--they'd be better in the summer--it was just the cold weather. The pressure in my chest when I climbed stairs--just need to start walking.  The varicose veins that cause my legs to swell--vascular surgery. The way my facial skin has aged, taking me from looking 40 into my 50s, to looking early 70s in my 60s. In my addictive haze, I rationalized that I could stop or reverse anything that assailed me.      How crazy is our thinking when we smoke, mine, anyway. Dr Abraham Twersky wrote a book called Addictive Thinking. He wrote about how an addict skews cause and effect, attributing a problem or problems to anything but the addictive substance. In these early days of quitting, when I'm still craving, I'll have to reread it to reinforce my understanding of the lies of the part of my mind that wants nicotine.
Oh Kate.  Hang in there.  I also made all those excuses,  but when I turned 60, I knew it was inevitable that I would get a smoking related illness.    I really think you have been mentally preparing yourself for this quit.  Keep educating yourself and stay close.  We are here to help you through.      Keep looking past those craves to the power and freedom you will receive when quit.
    Here is Joel Spitzer'sDay Two of Quitting Smoking.      Going through Joel's lessons are a great way to get through your first days.    Education really inspired me.       You must also reward yourself for every crave you conquer.  Many of my rewards were taking a delicious breath of oxygen, listening to a piece of music, acknowledging beauty in some way.   This helps to re-claim your brain receptors from nicotines grasp.       Stay true to your commitment to NOPE, and Never Take Another Puff, you will win.    It gets easier.  You are in the slog right now as nicotine leaves your body, Forever.   Glad you are here.

Stay close here Kate...
    Hi Kate,    i’m in The same boat. I just quit a few days ago. I still think about smoking when I first wake up. I’ve changed the way I have my morning coffee. And the place too. You can do this! This week has been hard with the  lovely parting gifts smoking has left me to deal with while my body works to undo all the damage. But this morning I’m feeling better. Just one day at a time. I can I will I must! My new motto. 
    The early morning was tough on me also -- when I had the strongest craves for a cigarette with a cup of coffee.  I went a hard way to combat and I drank cold juice or water first thing in the morning then deep breathing (I would also use the Jillar Air Cigarette also).  And yes I went all stupid and quit coffee at the same time, I knew that would be a huge trigger for me. It was very tough the first couple of weeks but I got thru it and the morning crave faded the fastest of all the other craves since I focused on it so much and since it was the biggest trigger for me it gave me the confidence to conquer all other craves.  And yes I have not had a cup of coffee since I quit smoking, very hard to believe!!!!!
Oh my I love my coffee drink it all day. I’ve had to give up a lot my things due to my type 1 diabetes. I can’t even think about giving up my coffee too. You are brave Martian

The mornings were tough for me too, Kate, but things did get better.        You are doing a great job of expressing what you are experiencing.  That helps you better understand what you are going through and also helps others early in their quits.  Keep doing this as I believe it will help you.     Also, congratulations on making it to day 2.  These early milestones really are huge and I hope you realize that.  Just keep taking it one day at a time and you will get there.Edited July 20 by johnny5
My three biggest triggers were alcohol, coffee, and food (after a meal).   I didn't drink alcohol for the first 3 months because I didn't need anything to make quitting any harder; I couldn't stop eating so instead I ate more; but, like Diane, I decided I would not give up my beloved all day coffee.  I was very happily surprised when I found that I still enjoyed drinking coffee without a cigarette and it actually became a bit of a life raft in my sea of abstinence. I guess I just need to have at least one active vice at any given time.   Interestingly, when I started drinking alcohol again after 3 months (although I was still definitely craving cigarettes), I found that having a drink was not only still enjoyable, but also helped ease by cigarette cravings at that point in my quit -- but I don't think it would have at the very beginning.  Cheers and hang in there, the things you love will still be lovable when the smoke clears.

    Hello everyone,  since most have you have a much longer quit than me what are the things that stop you from letting that nasty   addiction creep back into your life? 
"What are things that help you stay a non smoker ?"     I have chosen to never ever smoke again and I stand by that commitment every day.   Continuing my education about nicotine addiction also feeds my quit.        Addiction doesn't 'creep back in'   we make a conscious choice to smoke or never take another puff.Edited July 19 by Sazerac
    Fear....    When I arrived here. I was in fear of having my feet amputated.....due to smoking.. Quitting when I did ...I avoided this ...   Why would I go back there ..not a chance ....
    Doreen thanks a good reason for sure! 
When I quit, it was primarily out of frustration with the cigarettes being in control of my life.  I was sick and tired of being a slave to the smokes.  With that in mind, any time the voice of addiction was trying to convince me that "just one" would do the trick I thought beyond the "one" and saw where it would lead.  One turns to two.  Two leads to three.  And so on.  I knew if I smoked one, I would be right back at 25-30 per-day.  And recognizing that I would have ceded control of my life back to the smokes, that would have meant that I would be constantly thinking about how desperately I needed to quit.     Sometimes breaking the cycle is a simple matter of putting your head down and continuing forward progress.  Once I had a couple of days under my belt, I figured since I was already on the right trail I might as well keep on hiking.
     I just remember how I felt just before I quit smoking -- that can help.  One thing I do is still come here daily to read and to do the daily NOPE pledge so that I keep my focus and commitment to not ever smoking again and that has been a game changer.  Also remember to you have to remain ever vigilant to the voices of addiction (as Boo calls it) because the nicodemon  is always calling out to you -- the good thing is that the longer you are quit it gets harder and harder to hear or pay attention to that voice. And answering questions like this that may come up (good question by the way) helps keep my mind in the right place!!!!!
    Finding a forum with people who understood what I was going through was instrumental in helping me. Doing the NOPE pledge daily and continually telling myself that all good(?) things must come to an end really helped keep my mind on the prize.

    Thanks everyone. It never hurts to have as many way to stay a non smoker that you can get. I don’t like. To be controlled by anything and cigarettes have Certainly done that to me for many years. It’s time I take back my time. Geez when I think about all the things I’ve missed because I was smoking.
    Another thing that helped me, especially with really bad craves, was my JAC (jillars air cigarette). I just pretended I was holding an actual cigarette in my fingers and then went through the motions of "smoking" it. Some use cut straws, pens, etc.
    ^^^^^Yes this, when I read about Jillar's air cigarette I made one right away and it really helped -- great idea!!!!!
A support forum like this one.  It really gave me a sense of accountability in my quit and wound up making quitting a much more enjoyable experience (something I didn't think possible).       I also read Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Quit Smoking.  Some people don't like that book but it really helped me realize that smoking did nothing positive for you at all and that quitting is one of the best things you can do.  I still wouldn't call it an "easy way" but that book helped me and many others.      I smoked for 20 years.  The first 10 years, it was a very sociable experience.  The longer I smoked, though, the more of my smoking friends either quit or I lost track of.  I eventually grew to think of smoking as living under a dark cloud (literally and figuratively) of negativity, isolation and poison.  I wanted out of that.  When quitting, I really tried to focus on the positive.       In time, you will see that smoking does absolutely nothing positive for you whatsoever.  There is no negative in quitting.  It can be tough but it is worth it.Edited July 19 by johnny5

    Not feeling that cigs are controlling my life was a factor and the bad feeling when you have to find a reason to slip out or just get away from a group of friends to take a smoke.
    Recognizing that Junkie Thinking is nothing more than a brain pattern at work. Crying receptors.        It takes time  but it is trainable.         The emotional side of the Junkie Thinking needs attention too, but rather in a constructive way: Ask yourself, am I Hungry Angry Lonely or Tired? (HALT).
    It's hard to explain...but basically it's a mind set thing...when I quit this time I sort of just fell into it. I have a previous very long quit that I planned. Even though I stayed quit for years last time I was still thinking like the junky I was, focussing on what I was missing, and searching daily for a reason I could justify smoking again...for years... This time... Didn't plan to quit, just did it to sorta test meself but the big difference.... I don't even think about smoking anymore it doesn't tempt me ...and the big difference, I decided I would never smoke again, there is no reason that will make it acceptable. But it took time to get to this point.     Confession:  few months ago I had a really bad day at work...man I wanted a smoke...I smoke would fix it...went across the road to the cafe and bought some chew, just normal gum not NRT, and chewed my way through the day. Crave gone.       And being completely honest...I am terrified that if I did smoke I would loose the friends I made after quitting.
Well I would hope people wouldn’t stop being for friends for that reason. This time I had be thinking about quitting for a long time and I just had my doctor write the script for Chantix. I had it for over 2 weeks before I started taking it. Not knowing if I really believed it would work. I didn’t set a quit date. I just thought I see what happens. And after about the 3rd day I found myself not smoking as much. Til one day I didn’t really need the cigarettes after I lite them and I just put them out. But still I decided not to put too much pressure on myself to set a date. I found this site and than I set a day I would try to on Monday. Well I did quit but not til Monday night. I had 2 cigarettes Monday and I haven’t smoked since. I still find myself thinking I would be having a smoke while I wait to do this or that, but I find I can just not do it. I hope it stays this way. I know there will be times I think a cigarette would make me feel better. But I’m lying to myself I know it won’t and I’ll just me mad at myself for letting that little cancer stick control me once again. I can I will I must.

    I know me mates wouldn't snub me if I smoked, but I will admit, especially early on, I stoked that fear and used it to keep me not smoking.         Congrats @Diane R for being smoke free since mundee. That is brilliant. 
    Now the trick is to not get another vice to take the place of smokes! I’m trying not too. 
    Not smokin jo it is my dream to come to  Australia. It’s one of my big bucket list place to go! And I love  the  accents
    What accents, we don't have accents, everyone else does ..lol, joke Joyce.      Australia is the greatest place on earth (not biased)... and when you get down here you will love it. Just plan well it's the same size almost as the USA so unless you come for a long time you won't manage to see everything..it's a huge place. Wait that gives me an idea....get one of those money tins or jars and each week put the money you would have used to buy ya smokes in there....before you know it you'll have some of you coming to Australia money...two bucket list items for one, Visiting Aus and being Smoke Free.
     
    Thanks Sazerac. I really don’t want to replace smoking with anything. I’m working are not to.

    Thanks Johnny! I’m starting to feel human again lol. I’ve been stay in my little cave for the most part. Think I’ll try and get out tonight for a while.
    Great job Diane, I stayed close to home for almost my first month because I didn't trust myself to not stop at a store! 
    I have found that deep breathing exercises are a good sub for cigs and can help during a crave and also down the road for health. You can get this quit Diane R! Best wishes.

You just do not smoke.     You were not born as a smoker, so your brain in both conscious and inconscious manners has memory of how life was without cigarettes.       Just because you learned how to be a smoker, does not mean that forever you are to be a slave to the addiction.     It takes time for your brain to return to handling life without cigarettes, but it will. It did it before you became a smoker, and it will do it again now that you have quit. Just be patient, and most important thing is to not be afraid of nicotine addiction. It is not a monster hiding and waiting to get you. It has no intelligence. And no power. You control the it 100%. As long as you do not put nicotine in your body again, it will stay asleep.       Cristóbal
    Thanks everyone for the great advice! I went out tonight had a few drinks and dinner, than went over to the beach and listen to a band had a couple of drinks. People where smoking it didn’t bother me in the least. I’m no longer a smoker. I will not pick up any thing put it in my mouth and lite it on fire. Grant it you can’t smoke in a restaurant so that was no problem. But you can smoke outside where the band was playing. I think I did a good job of not smoking. Baby steps. I can’t hide in the house forever. 
    Well done D !!! The more you do it ,the easier it gets ...feel proud ....you did great !!!!
    Awesome Diane, glad you had a good, smoke free, time. Your First of many....  
@Diane R Was going to suggest to avoid alcohol for the first two weeks. But you made it through a drinking session. Way to go!!! You're doing great
    I only had a few drinks with dinner. I feel like I have to put myself out there. The world isn’t going to change because I stopped smoking. If I got  i’m comfortable at anytime I would have just left. But it really didn’t bother me. 
Hi ya!  I've been a smoker for longer than I like to admit.  I have quit a few times in the past using different techniques all with varying lengths of success.  I have been determined to quit and free myself for good for a few months now.  I purchased Allen Carr's book EasyWay for women to quit smoking, Bootcamp, and Quit Now all on audio.  I've listened to all 3 books numerous times but I found no success.  I let a bit of time pass and last week I listened to Bootcamp again.  I got so much out of it this time....so many Ah ha moments.  I understood more, saw what he was saying, and found truth in what I was listening to.  I was so stoked to crush my final cigarette.  I was so amazed there was absolutely no withdrawal pangs.  No depression.  No anger.  I was great! I was happy!  Then out of the blue I lit a cigarette (30 some hrs of being free).  I had no cravings to do this, no triggers, no stress.  I have no idea why I did this.  I went back to listening to Bootcamp again and I have no Ah Ha moments.  I understand since I've listened to this a few times it will be anti-climatic but I can't find what I missed that made me light up again.  Why?  Has anybody had a similar situation?  Any suggestions?  I did contact EasyWay and was told to listen again in 1 sitting but never received any insight as to what I am missing to free me from this slavery. Thanks!!!
    Welcome peeper glad you came aboard.  As to Allen Carr's books there is great information though I only read part of Quit Now, I really used this site way more for education and socialization and it helped greatly.  I never did have an Ah Ha moment -- I just realized I needed to quit and made a commitment and focused one day at a time.  I also realized I had to stay vigilant those first few weeks.  It is hard but it can be done.  Coming here can help you -- take time to review the site and some of the stories -- it really will help!!!

Rule Two: If you have any further questions, refer back to Rule One.
Welcome Peepers.  I never had an ah ha moment either.    I smoked for 42 years and tried everything to quit.  I was not successful until I found this forum.  I lurked for a while and even joined thinking I would never quit but something miraculous happened.  Supporters on this forum knew exactly how to guide me through my journey.    There are some tough moments in the beginning, as you rid yourself of the nicotine, then you learn to redirect your thinking.  I set my sights on looking forward and not backwards.    Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do for yourself.  I hope we can help you find your freedom from smoking.
    Welcome peepers, like the others I didn't have an aha moment either but knew I needed to quit. First thing to do: THROW OUT ANY CIGARETTES!!! You can't smoke what you don't have! Also, being with others who knew what I was going through and could offer insight helps unbelievable well. Stick close, we can help you through those tough moments  
Hello peeper !  Welcome to our merry band of quitters !     A eureka moment is not necessary to have a successful quit.     The only thing you are missing is making the commitment to yourself to never take another puff.     Not One Puff Ever (moment by moment, day to day....)        Sure, you may have some gruesome moments but, education about nicotine addiction    will help you understand and live through them as a Free person.        This post may help you negotiate your way around.10 Ways To Effectively Use This Forum
I remember reading a piece about this exact topic,  in which the question was something like, will I be able to quit without having some motivational kickstart, a true belief of succeeding. Hmm, cant remember where that was.        I was disappointed myself, when a book id read  prior to this quit, didnt do a thing for me. The realization though,  that I was externalising and not taking responsability for starting my quit, eventually led to that same start.       You know your reasons. Trust in the proces, you'll probably have plenty epiphanies coming your way!      Edited July 18 by MLMR
Thanks to all for your input but I am confused....above says to check out 10 ways to use this forum effectively. I checked it out and it says to read Easyway which I have already done. Easyway talks about no withdrawal symptoms (anger / cravings / substitutes etc) yet when I read the first few days most talk about fighting cravings, it so difficult, what was used to get through the cravings etc.  This is exactly the opposite of Easyway.  I'm not sure who or what I am suppose to follow.
    I didn't read Easy Way peepers but I can tell you that mindset plays a big part in how your quit goes. My first few months were pretty hard but I also dwelled on how hard it was. Others who were just done smoking had a much easier time. I quit because my health was suffering and had to. It wasn't so much wanting to as it was being ready to, if that makes sense. Maybe someone who's read the book will comment to your question. I don't see though how anyone gets away from cigarettes without some sort of withdrawal/recovery symptoms...    
There are many paths to the center.     The point of providing choices is;  everybody is different and will build their quit in their own unique way.   Some swear by Alan Carr,  others resonate with Joel Spitzer,    some find guidance through other quitting methods.      I quit cold turkey, that is my experience but, there are many successful quitters here who found NRT's helpful.     There is NO one way, no right way,  no magic bullet, except tocommit to never taking another puff,  and it has been my experience,  that educating myself about nicotine addiction,  especially the science of it,  helped me understand what I was going through and empowered me to keep my quit.     I read Alan Carr, watched all of Joel Spitzer's videos and lurked here and there to learn everything I could.   I am still learning.        I just want to add that quitting smoking is a personal journey and one that will provide numerous benefits, not only health, & wealth but an honest trust and confidence in yourself.    Edited July 18 by Sazerac
    ^ just like with how we have a cuppa we are all different.. saddly there is no miracle cure, the only consistent thing with all former smokers is we decided to take back control in our lives ...we choose not to put something in out mouths and set it on fire.
@peeper you lasted 30 hours without a smoke, so what did you learn? You learnt you can not smoke for a while day, and in your own words it was easy. So break it down, just quit for one day, you know you can do that...you already did...then the next morning when you wake up just quit for that day, only focus on not smoking for that day. The point is you only focus on 24 hours, one day, and you know that you can totally nail that. Don't worry about yesterday, forget about tomorrow...the only thing you can control is the now and in the now you do not smoke.
    ^^^^^What Joe says -- focus on one day at a time and if need be one hour at a time.  As said by others above this is a personal journey that we have all gone thru and can be different from others.  There will be tough times and we very well may be able to help guide you on the journey but the work is up to you, again commit and focus!!!
    Sounds to me like you're missing true commitment. Commitment to not buy cigarettes, posses cigarettes and smoke cigarettes. Books, videos and quit aid products are all well and fine but it always boils down to personal commitment to quit smoking. Without that commitment, you can not be successful!

I don't see though how anyone gets away from cigarettes without some sort of withdrawal/recovery symptoms...               There may be folks out there who were able to simply flip a switch and be done with smoking, but they are the exception rather than the rule.  Most of us had put in some time to unpack the mental and physical baggage of decades of addiction and conditioning.      To any of our newbies I would like to strongly suggest that you don't put added pressure on yourself when starting a quit.  I did it in past, failed, quit attempts.  I've seen people here on the Train doing it to themselves.  If you've quit smoking and realize all the ills that come with cigarettes but still want to smoke, it's understandable.  Addiction does not work from a place of reason and logic.  Eventually you will reach a point where you no longer want to smoke, but it takes time to get there.      Quitting smoking is strictly a pass/fail grade.  There are no style points and you're not rewarded for increased degree of difficulty.  You either quit or you don't.       There is only one question that matters in a quit: Did you smoke today?  If the answer to that question is "no"...you're good to go.  If the answer to that question is "yes"...you screwed it up, start over.
    Hi Peeper , Sounds like your over thinking...this can be dangerous ...and messes with your mind ..  Try and keep it  simple ..if it works for you ..then it works ..we are all different ...    No matter what method you use ,books video,s... ect...  You still have to do the work ...and never stick anything in your mouth and smoke it ..no matter what ..    Take smoking Off the table ...it works ...

It does boil down to commitment, I agree. I get where the folks who are struggling to keep a commitment. I felt as though I had two warring personalities, one that wanted to keep the commitment, the other easily overpowering it with the promise of easing the panic that something terrible was going to happen to my kids, or that I'd make a fatal mistake at work and lose my job. All that panic the result of craving nicotine, but my commitment wilted in the face of the anxiety.      I can't count the times I threw away cigarettes and lighters, said, "that's it!" and hours, days, or weeks later I blithely and without a specific trigger trotted off to the store for cigarettes. I don't know what was wrong with me. There has to be motivation to state, "I'm committed," and ongoing motivation to keep that commitment. I tried vitamins, Tony Robbins, a book, "What to say when you talk to yourself," nicotine replacement, self-hypnosis/suggestion, meditation...I can't remember what else. It was all in the service of trying to stay committed. It was as though I was only reaching one aspect of my personality, with the addicted aspect unaffected.     When I was successful for days or weeks, I don't really know where I found the motivation to stay abstinent for those periods of time, but made it only hours other times.      I agree, it does boil down to commitment. It's been staying motivated that has been lacking for me to keep that commitment. I feel committed now because the specter of encroaching blindness looms on my horizon. In the mind of a person who keeps the commitment, is there perhaps a consciously or subconsciously held picture/sounds/feelings that are more powerful than addiction?
    Holding fast to a commitment isn't necessarily fun or sexy, motivating or inspiring.        It is just a minute by minute, day to day affirmation to never take another puff.       A certain maturity and power ensues when instant gratification takes a back seat and rewards accumulate with time.      This thread may be usefulNOPE ~ Never/Ever/Forever   
Hi Peeper,      What you are missing from       On 7/18/2019 at 11:22 AM, peeper said:              I  did contact EasyWay and was told to listen again in 1 sitting but never received any insight as to what I am missing to free me from this slavery. Thanks!!!             Most people who quit smoking do not use a forum, or study ways to quit.     They simply make a decision to "Never Take Another Puff", and then keep the commitment with themselves.          A big danger of studying different ways of quitting is to believe that studying is what will keep your quit.    It does not.    What is missing from your quit, is that you have not yet made your commitment to "Never Take Another Puff".     It does not make any difference how many times you read Alan Carr's  or EasyWay materials or watch Joel Spitzer's videos, or use nicotine patches, nicotine gum, Chantix, accupuncture, hypnosis....    Without this commitment, you will always fail.          That is the answer, to your question "what I am missing to free me from this slavery".                 Avoid "analysis-paralysis". The very tall "quit smoking" mountain you think is front of you, is a illusion. Your F.E.A.R. is actually "False.Expectations.Appearing.Real".       Keep it simple, make your commitment with yourself to never "Never Take Another Puff", and simply do not look back.        That is all you really need to keep your quit clean, easy to maintain, and 100% successful.     Forever.            Cristóbal
Hi @peeper and welcome aboard!!! A lot of good advice has been given here already. Bottom line is, it takes a commitment to oneself not to smoke. Talking to people on QuitTrain can be helpful. However, no matter what anyone says, and irrespective of the methods (books/videos/NRT...etc.) used to quit smoking, one has to make a commitment to oneself not to smoke. It takes courage as well. You may be scared as to not knowing how you will be to handle life as an ex-smoker. You may be scared to throw out all your smoking paraphernalia. You may be scared not knowing how you will carry out your day to day routine without smoking. Although easier said than done, take quitting smoking in your stride and work through it an hour and a day at a time. Keep yourself busy with activities. Drink plenty of juice and water during the first 3 days. Take the NOPE pledge on the forum, it helps. When I do get a crave, I admit to myself I need a smoke, but I also say to myself that I'm not going to submit to it. Personally, I never read any books w.r.t quitting smoking, I just watched Joel's videos and talked to people on QuitTrain. I also take the NOPE pledge everyday. I also stuck as many post-its I could that say "Never Take Another Puff" all over my room, and the post-its still remain to this day. Its like a reminder for the commitment I made to myself not to smoke. You can also watch Joel's videos on his YouTube channel, working through them a day at a time as organized in playlists. Here's the link:  https://www.youtube.com/user/joelspitz     Here's a video that may be of some help to you:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTb3d5cjSFI        All the best!!!
It was after quitting smoking, I realized  how addiction had turned me into a spoiled brat.I indulged myself completely,  I smoked anytime and anywhere possible.My most shameful example was after a home birth,my brand new daughter, alive and healthy,was being walked around by her father and I said to my midwifes,'man,  after 9 months and the last 12 hours, I NEED A SMOKE'.One of my midwifes asked,'Really ?''Yes yes yes yes yes YES, I want a smoke !"                                                                                                          She handed me a non filtered cigarette from the pack she had hidden in her jacketand that was the end of that abstinence for 29 years !I call it 'abstinence' because I never ever wanted to quitand only quit smokes and drinks 'temporarily' for pregnancy.That was really Big of me, huh ? I didn't give a hoot about second hand smokeand that was worse than just acting the spoiled brat.Second hand smoke does actual HARM to people, animals and plants. Smoking is suicidal, homicidal, herbicidal, biocidalall the cidal-s you can think of and continues to makethe tobacco companies rich beyond measureGah! I am elated  to not be lining those evil pockets anymoreglad also, to not be 'cidal' anything.and one more thing...                                                                               My Spoiled Brat also made quitting harder.'This is too hard'  the brat would moan'I don't want to !'  the brat would whine'Why Are You Denying Yourself ?

When my father was in the hospital dying of lungcancer, me and my mom sneaked downstairs for a smoke outside :(
When i had my first little baby...weighing in at six pounds...The ash tray was waiting on the cupboard next to me...Ignorance..selfishness..stupid...as she was growing up...I wouldn't let the wind blow on her..Just my second hand smoke...
I could list so many times, all as bad as each other. Smoking never seemed to be my life but it certainly was.You need to break though to the other side and then it is so obvious :(
It is a very selfish habit. Things I didn't do because I wanted to smoke...

    I'd quit while pregnant and feeding but the minute that was done... smoke back in mouth... not proud of it. AT ALL. 
    I LOVE this post, thank you for sharing 
    Geez....from Brat to Angel.....pretty cool. (thank you)!
    Coming to terms with how addiction turned us into selfish, spoiled brats    made it easier for me to identify the addicts voice and choose Freedom's voice. The voices are both powerful and one leads us to incredible changes and attitudes,  the other keeps us down and abused. Start listening to your voice of freedom no matter how faint it may be, it will soon be so beautifully loud and inspiring.  Your Spoiled Addicted Brat has nothing for you. Never did, never, never will.

    Sazerac,        Not sure if you were really a spoiled brat or just in denial about what you were actually doing.        Regardless, I see you on this board constantly helping others so maybe the karma will balance out someday.

'           The Brat cajoled and wheedled           until I simply had no other choice,         I killed the Spoiled Brat.          Killed Dead.            Spoiled Brat-icide.         Hah !           If you are thinking about quitting, Know You Can.           You don't have to be the spoiled brat that addiction turns us into or,  a slave to nicotine anymore.            You Can Quit.                   I don't want to make light of how anyone feels during their detox from nicotine but,    please ! look at the big picture...you never have to go through this again  and all the discomfort is temporary.    Freedom is Forever.
    Thanks for sharing this.

Then the view changed and smokers became ostracized and shamed.  That is when it really hit home with me.  Instead of hiding my head in the sand, I began hiding myself in my home and not smoking around people.  The isolation and shame lead to depression.

My weekly visits with him never lasted more than an hour at a time. I was a closet smoker. I'd make excuses to leave. I couldn't stand another minute without smoking.
    Came across this TEDx Talk this morning. It resonates with me and thought maybe someone else who is struggling might find it helpful. It has given me hope.  
Quitting smoking can bring quantum changes in a life.  The self-confidence and the trust in yourself propels you to bigger changes.     What's going on with your quit date, @Kate18 ? It reads today (July 19, 2019), is that correct ?    I'm hoping it is a typo but, are you back after a relapse ?

It reads today (July 19, 2019), is that correct ?                    I'm hoping it is a typo but, are you back after a relapse ?         It is not a typo, unfortunately. I lapsed and had given up. I had no confidence in myself to keep a pledge to not smoke and was never going to come back to QT. I've been impulse driven. The insidious thought that one more pack won't really matter had me going from pack to pack. I'd resigned to being a smoker.      Seeing the video, and recognizing the truth of what Davos says--a lot of it from Anthony Robbins, I think--reminds me of how change can happen and gives me a glimmer of hope again.    I like Davos's suggestion of saying out loud--and I think "out loud" is a key factor-- that "what I really want is ......."  She suggested air, what I really want is air. In essence, I think it's, "what I want is a hit of dopamine, a sense of elation or relaxation without it being prompted by a hit of nicotine."       I'm making this up as I go through my day today. I'm buying a few cookies when I get to work.  I'm practicing what she said.  For today, it's "what I really want is the small sugar rush when I eat a cookie on my break." I'll figure out tonight what I can do tomorrow.     I just ordered a sustainable farming book on Amazon, "How to Grow More Vegetables (and Fruits, Nuts, Berries, Grains, and Other Crops) Than You Ever Thought Possible on Less Land with Less Water Than You Can Imagine." Jeavons, John. The reality of my ever having a mini-farm again (I had one years ago) is dim--I'm 69 and have to work until I drop. But the dream makes me happy. I'm hopeful that studying the book will give me hours of pleasure--dopamine, that is.        Other than the above, I don't know how to make this time quitting different. At least I'm out of the mindset that I was always going to be a smoker. I had quit trying. I realized two days ago that my eyesight in one of my eyes went from 20/40 to about 20/60 within the space of four months. Scared me. This morning I went online to review quit-smoking sites and motivational, self-improvement quotes. I found this video and what Davos says makes sense. After so many failures, I'm afraid of failing again. But if I don't try again, I am doomed to a nightmarish life.
    Kate !  Do not give up !  You can quit and I am so glad you came back.  Never stop quitting.    Stop Smoking !      When I had a crave or a trigger I would holler, Free Your Head !    and take beautiful clean breaths, Oxygen !  Commit to NOPE, quit fooling around.    You have plenty of time left to enjoy and thrive in your freedom.   Stay close, we are looking out for you.
    Sorry you smoked Kate ,but glad to see you have taken your seat back in the train ...   Never give up ,giving up....do whatever it takes ....   Remember your not giving up anything but poison that will kill you ...your freeing yourself...  Wake up each day ..shouting Yipee I'm free...a Fabulous Non Smoker....I'm no more a slave to that Nico Monster.
    So glad your back Kate.  Yes, never give up quitting.  I was like you and never thought I could quit.  I became a closet smoker and gave up on life.  Finding this forum gave me the power to quit.  Stay close and we will help you through.
    Hi Kate, glad you're back to quitting. And glad you came back to qt. I think one huge thing you haven't tried yet is staying glued to this site. I'm not joking when I tell you that it worked great for me. I was on any and every time I could be and found that keeping my mind busy with reading and responding to all the various threads really did help silent the constant thoughts of smoking. And if I did feel like I was getting ready to cave to a crave I posted about it and people came running to get me through it.   I REALLY do think you should try it this time. Who knows, it just may be the trick  
Yesterday I allowed myself foods (including some rather high in sodium--forbidden because they worsen glaucoma) -- in order to stimulate the pleasure center of the brain and counteract the void left by ceasing to feed my brain with nicotine. I especially like hot dogs, which, unfortunately, are a class-1 carcinogen. Won't repeat that one, but I enjoyed them immensely with some rice and vegetables.  It worked to stop the cravings. I made it with little difficulty to evening.      It isn't a permanent solution, but for a few days I'll indulge. I just had a cookie left over from yesterday with my coffee.        I joined the 24 Hour Fitness gym across the street from my neighborhood. My first induction/training session is Monday. I want to see how much nicotine-craving can be countered by exercise, and how long the effect lasts.        Anyone have success with easing cravings with exercise? The amount of it? How often do you have to exercise to stave off craving?       I'm thinking it could be useful to learn to properly punch a punching bag at the gym. When I visualize that I'm punching the bag as a surrogate for a cigarette or the tobacco industry, or the dark side of myself that wants to smoke--quite a satisfying image.
    Kate, exercise is a great distraction.  You also deserve to reward yourself.   Each day you power through your craves, it will get easier.  
I was thinking about Doreen caring for her Tonyand found this video on what emphysema feels likehere are two short videosand our friend, Joel Spitzer KEEP YOUR QUITS Y'ALL 
That is terrifying! I sent the shorter video to my husband and roommates. They smoke, but have been thinking about quitting since I have. I told them it's some motivation for them. One of my roommates is going to quit on Monday, actually. 
I found this over at http://www.emphysema.net/smokers.html I believe it covers the trajectory in excruciating detail.

    The first days can seem like the longest days of your life. I’m sitting here this morning counting all the reason I’m quitting. So many wonderful reason but still the beast is calling. I’ll have a bite to eat and I’m  so accustomed to having that after meal cigarette and then I realize I don’t really need it. Come on here and read some post or watch a video. Thank goodness for this forum. And all the wonderful members who take the time to help all us newbies. 
Oh yes Diane, the constant thoughts of cigarettes drove me crazy too. That lasted longer than any of the other quit symptoms I was going through. And yes, finding others who knew what I was going through helped me a lot too. I found that supporting my fellow quitters gave me that break from thinking about smoking that I so badly needed and stayed glued to the forum daily.  The forum is also where I first discovered using my air cigarette to get past a bad crave. It really worked to trick my mind into thinking it was getting the real thing so if things get too bad, try it.  Oh and congratulations on day 2
    Write down all your reasons for quitting.   You might want to post a Pre Response to your own  SOS    HERE. and here is a video index of our friend, Joel Spitzer,  Daily Quitting Lesson Guide These vids helped me immeasurably.      Soon your body will be free of nicotine !   I am so glad you made the step to quit.  You will be fine and free !
    I napped a lot just to escape a the cravings for a bit while still moving the clock.  Seriously.  But I was a very grumpy quitter.  
I’m moody too Jordan7. I can’t help it. Than I’m constantly saying I’m sorry. Everything seems to get on my last nerve. My daughter called me last night and the kids where in the car with her. I had to go they weren’t doing anything just being kids but I couldn’t take the noise my head hurt so bad.

    And I swear time was almost standing still for me during those earl days. A day seemed like a week. It was frightening. I thought it might stay that way - lol. I think most of us end up with a short fuse during the early days. I learned to keep my yap shut, especially if it involved my wife, although she knew what was going on so she picked here times carefully to approach me with any issues.
Congratulations on making it to Day 2 @Diane R!!! Keep marching on forward!!!

Each day gets better.
You are right Diane.  Those first days seem to be a total obsession with fighting off the cravings.  And the irritability is off the charts.  I still recall standing in the "15 items or less" line at the supermarket and my head nearly exploded as I counted the 21 items that the sweet, elderly lady in front of me unloaded on the conveyor belt.  When she pulled out her checkbook to pay I just lost it.  "Are you %#&ing kidding me!?!?!?!"  Calmness and sanity will come back.  And the freedom from "needing" to light up every half hour will actually make your life much more peaceful.    Keep up the good work.  You're on track.
    Yes I also thought the first couple of weeks seemed like months.  When I found this group it helped me get thru those "long days".  But as each day passed I saw new benefits and that really helped me get thru the worst.  Keep going girl you are strong and you are doing this!!!
I keep telling myself  patience is a virtue but it’s not helping very much lol. And I also have a lab Jordan7 my baby boy Samson. He been staying close by me. He knows something is different. Such smart dogs. I would walk him more if I had the Energy. I miss that the most. I can’t wait to have my energy back so I can join the gym!
Here's some reading for you Diane       https://www.quittrain.com/topic/2747-your-first-days-nicotine-free/     Your body is trying to rid itself or a lot of toxins; it's going to take some time but the human body has an amazing ability to heal.
    Hang in there Diane. You are getting through the worst of it. Fight that Nicodemon with all you have. Things will get better the more time you invest in your quit!
    Get up off your rusty dusty, "make a move-change a thought".    You will feel so much better, it will get your endorphins flowing,  just do it.

I remember sitting in my house locked up like a prisoner for almost the whole first week of my quit and wish now that I had just forced myself to get off my butt and get out in the fresh air. Just a short walk or anything. Not only revitalizes you physically but will distract you from smokey thoughts. Take you doggie for a short walk. You'll both be better off for it

    How are you feeling, Diane ?    Hope I didn't give you a Disco ear worm yesterday.  Soon nicotine will be gone from your body and the healing will begin.   Our bodies are amazingly forgiving.
    Thanks you checking on me Sazerac.  I’m just waking up. So far so good. Took the dog out and didn’t think about having one at all. Of course I wake up with a headache. No biggie  Ibuprofen here I come and my coffee. Yesterday afternoon I decided to go hang by the pool. That helped a lot. So hot here in July. And I could do a little  exercise in the pool. Not ready for the gym just yet. I don’t seem to be as  achy this morning. So I’m going to try and get a little housework done today. And if I get to tired to finish oh well, i’ll get there. It’s going to take a little longer this go around. I never had and of the withdrawals with the laser treatment. I look at it this way if I think about ever putting a cigarette in my mouth I’m going to remember how awful I have felt when I quit. That should do it. At least I hope. This is no fun at all. And I’m not a spring chicken lol  
    You're doing great Diane.  It's WAY more rewarding to accomplish something that was a challenge than to achieve something that was effortless.

    Samson loves to play fetch. And he loves swimming. Which I had planned on doing again with him today but it’s raining here. South Florida summers never know what you will get. I put my quit post up on Facebook last night. I got a lot of you can do it. I didn’t really tell to many people I was quoting right away.

Here is something sickening I found on the Wall Street Journal twitter feed today,       The Wall Street Journal Retweeted  WSJ Custom Content‏ Paid Program for PMI:   More than $6 billion has been spent researching and developing smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes.       A short vid,     It's Time To Unsmoke,      sponsored by our friends at Phillip Morris.Edited July 18 by Sazerac
    And it continues. Anyway to promote their product.  So Sad.  (as a side note I got and ad from Juul stating that they are going to stop producing and shipping flavored nicotine products to their retailers, why not any of their products -- shows money is more important) !!!!
    Yuh the y will never stop. 
    Seems legit.        Wait ......... isn't that what I said about the advertising for cigarettes when I first started smoking?
We may have quit smoking but our environment is still bombarded with the toxic chemicals contained in the filters of the discarded cigarette butts. World wide, it's in the Trillions annually. I can't even wrap my head around trillions. I know I have never seen that descriptor mentioned on my bank statement!https://globalnews.ca/news/4418956/cigarette-butts-ocean-pollution-ban/
    I have to admit that I always wondered about this as I smoked -- and yes I was part of the problem.  I believe that cigarettes have caused more harm than what we have ever thought.  This is hard to wrap my head around but something I have to look deep inside myself as to the consequences.  This is something to follow up on and move forward with!!!!
I'm more motivated than ever to join a local clean-up volunteer group. 1 person may not make a huge difference but I will make at least some difference. That's important because I too was a major contributor to this problem for more years than I care to admit!
    And maybe more of us should, I too will commit myself to volunteer for local clean ups. We have a clean up the beach a couple times of year and this is for sure one I will work on ( have you ever seen how many butts are on the beach)!!!!
Well, I pick up cigarette butts all along my street nearly every day, in a mostly calm fury.    When I smoked I thought I was being virtuous by 'field stripping' my smoke, which is stubbing out the fire, twisting the leftover tobacco out and pocketing the filter to be thrown in the trash.       You know where the trash goes ?  Landfill, put out to sea on a barge, or sent to another country.   Filters are not biodegradable.  My nearly 300,000 cigarette butts are still on the planet.  Sickened at the reality.  Virtuous pffftttt.
The following was some of the more weird things I didwhile going through the stress of decompress.  Sharpen knifes.  Oh Vay!  scrape, scrape, scrape....Take your time with it.  Focus on getting the sharpest edge.All my knifes are very sharp. Emptied out my ashtray into a glass jar (with lid).  Added a bit of water to the mix.  When I feel the need I take a good long look at this stuff.  If I still feel the need I unscrew thelid and take a long deep whiff.  Really brings back the wholesmoking experience - to include the gagging, retching, and full body coughing. If the time and place allows for it; a good stiff drink.  One shot only!  Purely for medicinal purposes.  Bonus points for Barcardi 151. A personal favorite.  Chopping Wood.  Nothing like swinging an axe to work out the aggression and utter unfairness that constant denial piles onto my little psyche.  Plus, I'm doing something constructive! Hold your breath until the desire to breath meets and exceeds the desire to smoke.  While holding your breath contemplatehow each cigarette you consume brings you closer to holding yourbreath involuntarily. Breathing is far more satisfying then smoking. Enjoy a fresh Jalapeño. Pop the whole thing in your mouth and chew slowly.  mmmmmm...  Bonus points for not having water near at hand.
Cool post, Sirius * I sharpened all my knives, too !  In fact, I got into the excellent habit of keeping them sharp.  I have a lot of knives. * Deep cleaned my house like a maniac, it was so beautiful.  I wish that maniac chick would come back once in a while. * I was eating a lot of Satsumas and worms aren't crazy about citrus near the compost so,     I scraped down the white from the skins, put the skins in bottles with isopropyl alcohol and made excellent mosquito repellent. *  Yes !  Breathing ! Learning how to take a break after a chore and have beautiful clean deep breaths be my 'reward'.
Good ideas. I preach licking an ashtray or asshole. Same result of shit breath
I love this post...at the beginning some craziness is needed..Besides music blasting down my ears..probably damaged them.lol...I drew a face on a pillow with a marker pen....And punching hell out not it.....sending it flying through the air..or lying it on the bed and punching away for all my life..Oh it felt good...
Cool post, Sirius * I sharpened all my knives, too !  In fact, I got into the excellent habit of keeping them sharp.  I have a lot of knives. * Deep cleaned my house like a maniac, it was so beautiful.  I wish that maniac chick would come back once in a while. * I was eating a lot of Satsumas and worms aren't crazy about citrus near the compost so,     I scraped down the white from the skins, put the skins in bottles with isopropyl alcohol and made excellent mosquito repellent. *  Yes !  Breathing ! Learning how to take a break after a chore and have beautiful clean deep breaths be my 'reward'. *Quietly retreats from the thread....
*Quietly retreats from the thread.... Well I did say "Crazy." I'll make another thread detailing the elegant, suave, and glamorously sophisticated yet coolly cerebral things I did to quit as soon as I think of anything that fell into that category.  B)

Speaking more in generalities I would recommend:Don't replace your addiction with another addiction.   Don't use smoking cessation as an excuse (too much).Use crutches if you have to but wean yourself off them at some point.The first week or two is hell week.  Its tough but the time does pass.Remember why you quit and keep the list at hand.Make the NOPE pledge every morning to yourself, in the mirror.Sugar free gum gives the pucker something to do.Chewing Ice.  Hmmm...so much for generalities...Off to the land of the wierd - I have fresh spearmint growing on my property.  I'll pick some and grind between hands till hands are wet.  Drop spearmint and cup hands over nose and inhale sharply through the nostrils.  It may be that strong (and hopefully pleasant)) scents serve to interfere with a craving.  It gives me something of a reset.   It's like my brain is saying, "gotta have a smoke, gotta have a smo-  **SPEARMINT!!!**"
    Bump    What are some of the odd things you did/do while you quit smoking ?
    My weirdest by far was my JAC (jillars air cigarette). I'm positive I looked like an idiot puffing on an invisible cigarette lol. 
    I formulated a plan for Australia to take over the world and bring about world peace.... There is a dossier...there are spreadsheets and graphs....there is a timeline....it is completely feasible..... I have pricing projections, contingencies for those countries a bit slower to come in line um I mean join the party.... But shhhh I'm saying to much....this plan is perfect, Australia  will rule the world, everyone will be happy, but let it be know you should take the time to translate my posts cos before ya know it you will need to know Strine it might just come in handy. 
    Can you bring Aussie weather to Canada In Feb,? I'd vote for you if the answer is YES!!
    I can learn to say G/Day instead Hi Lar.!!!!
    If you can learn to say; "Holy F*** It's cold!!!" You can move to Canada!

When I was 11 and started to smoke ...I took some smokes out of my Mum and Dad's packets ...they never knew ....

As the first few days were the worst, during my free time on those days I cleaned everything I could in the house. My bedroom furniture went from yellow to white. Curtains, all my clothes, and bedding got laundered. Pictures came off the walls to get a cleaning, walls got cleaned, everything I could clean.     It kept my mind off wanting to smoke plus I figured if I wanted smoking out of my life, I needed to rid as much evidence and stench as possible.    Going from being a smoker to a non-smoker is kind of a big transition. While it is not possible to get rid of smoke residue 100% but I was going to do everything I could to live as a non-smoker. My car got a good cleaning and the ash tray bleached.        Of course I had already gotten rid of the rest of my cigarettes, my cigarette rolling machine, paper tubes, ash trays, etc.     It made it easier to stay quit with everything clean.
Sarge logged over 1800 miles on The DreadMill (basement treadmill) that first year.     Every time he wanted to smoke, he hopped on and ran a mile the fastest he could.    Got up to running full marathons within a year.     A typical year is under 1000 miles these days, with the past 13 months being exactly zero. Diddley-Squat.   No. Miles . Logged.     Achilles injury.    EZPZ
    My wife and I quit almost at the same time. With this song (and a few others) at maximum volume for hours and on repeat,                we cleaned the house all the time.      And then when we finished, we cleaned again the clean house.        If I never hear this song again, it will never bother me !!!            Cristóbal
    I put all my favourite songs on my I pod.!!!!!  Loud in my ears ...I quit but now I'm deaf !!!!......only kiddin.....   I danced around the house for months ..singing away ....it worked for me ...took away any crave.....
I walked down the street to the store and bought a bunch of white chocolate.    The store was 7 miles away. It took all day.
    How long would this pile last the average smoker ...just over a year ...maybe not that long for some ....   There is no such thing as ..Just One !!!!......      
Wow!  I think I have smoked about 28 of those piles.

Hey, I can add my 10,000 to the pile.  Wow, all of that would have been inside of me ....
    Hello everyone, when did you feel like the worse of the  nicotine addiction was behind you. I’m  struggling  With that today. I want to go out on the patio and have a cigarette but I know it’s not going to taste good. And will mostly likely make me beat myself up for breaking weak and lighting one. And I will only have a few puffs and put it out. Geez why can’t I just put them down? I can do anything esle I decide I want to do
You can do this, too.  You have to decide that there are absolutely no circumstance in which it is okay to take even one puff.  You reactivate the addiction each time you do.  You have to truly believe there is not one positive effect from smoking, other than relieving the withdrawal symptoms that begin again within 30 minutes.Edited July 14 by Nancy
Hi Diane, to be honest, my whole first year sucked. BUT, I was my own worse enemy. Like Nancy said, once you realize smoking offers nothing positive, you'll have a much easier time.   I see that you're quit date is July 11? So you already have three days under your belt. That's half way through what we call hell week. The name speaks for itself....  It's not going to be easy but it is doable, IF you truly are ready to quit......Edited July 14 by jillar
    If you have cigarettes around you, it makes it way too tempting to go smoke one and yes, all of the negative things you mentioned will happen should you light up again. Get rid of any smokes you have access to and old ash trays etc. As Nancy said, every time you light another one up .... you renew your addiction; every time! The only way to break that cycle is to quit and stay quit. Sure there's some uncomfortable days in the beginning but the longer you stay quit, the easier it gets.       In terms of your question about the worst being over? It's different for all. The first week pretty much just sucks big time. Then, each week gets gradually better. You start seeing good days but still have down days too so, it's not like flipping a switch. It's a process The .improvement is very gradual.      The key is your mind set. Stay positive! You are doing the best possible thing for yourself. You need to celebrate that. Embrace the suck of the early days because they will soon be gone and that discomfort represents the fact that you are healing - body & mind!       
    You are in the first week and as said above it is tough and it sucks but you can get thru it-- just stay focused, use deep breathing techniques and drink cold water when a crave comes on and use the  air cigarette.  It takes some time to go thru the process -- no magic bullet here just determination.  It does get better week by week and as you celebrate those milestones and the monthly ones then you see your own control and determination wins out !!!!
Please correct me if I am wrong, @Diane R,  but, I was under the impression that you haven't quit yet.  You were starting Chantix and preparing for your quit.  Is this right ?     It is the commitment to yourself to never take another puff that matters.       Quitting smoking doesn't kill you,  craves do not kill you,     triggers do not kill you.   SMOKING KILLS YOU.      We have all lived through some gnarly times and some easy times, too.       Once you make the commitment, smoking isn't a choice anymore.       You can power through, 'embrace the suck' as our friend, Sarge, says.   Change the Story, Free your Head to emerge stronger and more confident with a solid and profound trust in yourself.     To answer your question, when did you feel the worse was behind you?    I feel the worse is in front of me should I ever choose to smoke even one puff ever again.   Edited July 14 by Sazerac
Diane, things will not improve until you stop smoking altogether.  There will be a rough few weeks but once you brace the suck and quit, you just keep looking forward.  Looking forward to a life without a smoking related illness or possibly a longer much healthier life.      I smoked for 42 years and was so depressed and discouraged that I could not quit.  I was so embarrassed and ashamed that I continued to smoke knowing that it would most likely lead to a terrible end.  I was lucky to find the forum. To answer your question, yes it was tough for about a month.  Once the nicotine is out of your body, you just keep redirecting those thoughts to your new and improved life.
    No I’m not totally smoke free. But I’m working really hard at it. I’m not smoking when I drive which is huge. And I’m not smoking a whole cigarette at all. Mostly just lighting it and having a few puffs and putting it out. Chantix is making that possible. And I’m not buying anymore cigarettes so tomorrow should be it for me. I think it’s more but going though the motions of smoking that I’m having the  most trouble with. And thanks again for all the support and tips.  
You can do it Diane...  Think of it as a little monster ...one puff of nicotine keeps him alive and kicking ....starving him of nicotine will kill him off...after 3 days he's gone ... Unless you light up again ...then he springs back to life .....this is why we carnt have  !! just One Puff. !!!.....
Thanks Doreen! That’s so true. Little devil always temping me. I have to show him the door. He doesn’t belong here. Nope. So far 0 today. I just have to take it hour by hour.

You poisoned your body for 40 years. You can't just expect to be over it in a month or two.     I knew I was past the addiction fairly quickly. I never really craved a smoke after I quit and I knew I'd never smoke again, so that helped.  I did, however, deal with pretty bad mood swings and a short temper for many months. Jesus bless my sweet girlfriend for putting up with me through it all.       It was around the 9 month mark that I finally felt normal.      You have to remember that this is a process. You have to be determined to put in the work and stay strong and focused.      Bottom line- If you are 100% committed, you can't fail.

Let’s see, (checks calendar) it’s been over 3 yrs since I quit.  So I would say, that give or take a few days, not counting holidays,  was there a leap year?  No leap year, good.   I started feeling that the worst was behind me early last week.        I’m joking of course.   The worst was behind me the day I quit.   The aftershocks I would say lasted about a month for me.  Your mileage may vary of course.  But that day will come when you don’t even think about it.   You’ll be going to dinner or a movie or be getting on a plane and not even think about when and where can I smoke?   You’ll stop scoping out new places for the smoking area the minute you arrive.       You will feel better, smell better, and save money, and have a lot less stress in your life
Thanks everyone. I’m doing ok today. I didn’t light one up on a 4 1/2 hours drive from the west coast. And I was driving. And ex smokers you  that’s a long time (when you smoke in your car)and great  accomplishment. At least for me. I’ll take it. Of course I want to smoke but I didn’t do it.
    I didn't think it would be possible for me to never smoke again the day I quit. Now, I don't think it would be possible for me to ever smoke again. Funny how your perspective changes once you make that commitment to change your life.
    I didn't even want to quit and now I'm kicking myself I didn't do it sooner. Never thought I'd be able to. Now..I don't see myself ever smoking again.      As to when it got better...don't really know it was so gradual that one day I went, hey haven't thought about smoking for??? Since??..dunno when..woohoo.       Don't worry about when, worry about NOW.... especially in the early days focus on today...tomorrow isn't here yet and yesterday can't be rewritten.  
Thanks everyone and good morning. So far 0 today. One day at a time. I can I will I must!
Yes -- look at this as one day at time, they add up quickly.  You will get to the point where you think less and less about smoking but it takes some effort to get there.  Again focus on that one day  and you  can do this!!!Edited July 16 by Martian5

Nice post :)
Not only will quitting lead to becoming a healthier non-smoker, the process of quitting will serve you well in every area of life.  Any stress you feel during the process will lead to adaptation.  Adaptation leads to strength.  Strength facilitates living.  The process is simple and the rewards of quitting when weighed against the challenges make the decision an obvious one.   Break the chains and start reaping the rewards.
I wish we could bottle and hand out that "eureka" moment. As smokers, we lived in perpetual fear that we will always crave or be triggered when the reality is you co create that yourself.Stop doing it and you're freer then you were. Educate about nicotine addiction and you move another step towards eureka. Then just give it some time and distance and trust that the feelings will subside. All of which is less effort then smoking in reality, more cost effective and better for your health. After that the mental ability benefits start piling in and you feel so much clearer, about everything! x

    You need this education and understanding about nicotine addiction in order to quit successfully for ever!      Without this and other quit smoking forums, I'm not sure I would have ever done the research on my own to come to this important understanding. That's the real benefit of smoking cessation boards is the wealth of useful and critical information that is available and the people who have used it in their own quits who can guide you to it. Reading the material, understanding it and putting it into practice is up to you as an individual. Quitting is our individual responsibility. Others can only assist and support you.
I watched a wonderful man wither away. He went from working on big rigs to needing a mobility scooter...not easy for a man like him.    After he was diagnosed COPD/CHF, man...he went downhill fast.   He turned into a beef jerky version of himself...like the all the life had just been sucked out of him and left him begging a tank for air. He still smoked tho. Colon cancer, leukaemia, nicotine addict.  Took almost 3 days for his body to drown him to death. His family by his side (well, when it wasn't THEIR turn to go smoke because YOU just had one!!)...you could smell that room from the entrance.   All the while he's dying, (before they finally put him in a medically induced coma) he'd pretend to be asleep...then he'd peep open an eye and yell at everyone "Go the fxxx home!" "I hate y'all crybabies" and of course "gimme a smoke" "I DONT CARE WHAT THEY SAY!!"    Did I mention this was all very hard on a man like him? His wife (God, I love this woman)...beautiful, red haired, angel of a woman; by his side 60yrs...he tells her "Get your axx outta here, You still ain't worth nothin."  She sat there 3 days with this...didn't ask one bit of help because (let's be honest) she didn't know how.  She said the most relieve she felt is when the monitors went flat...She said he snored heavily and she knew that was his last breath, and in that moment the weight of the world was finally off her shoulders. She had taken care of him for years leading up to his death. Not a wife, a companion, a friend, a lover, none of the things you think of when you look at your spouse on your wedding day.  She gave him pills, baths, fed him, lifted him, she was his chemo chamber-pot maid...   The last time I went by, she had already cleaned out the dark den (where he would spend most of the day watching tv and smoking) and was in the process of cleaning up the 2nd bedroom they had converted into a medical suite for him. She had even dyed her hair, which made my heart smile because she is totally worth it   Smoking doesn't only ruin the smoker's life...think about the people that love you.
    Powerful post Jane! The damage long term smoking does is horrible - and often not only to the smoker themselves!

She had even dyed her hair, which made my heart smile because she is totally worth it           Smoking doesn't only ruin the smoker's life...think about the people that love you.                                 Sometimes I read a post here..

Still a smoker...her last one 24 hrs before she passed...   I will never stop missing her every second of every day.... It's hard to watch someone you love ...believe they carnt quit....

    "Quitting smoking is not hard.  In fact, the whole process is quite enjoyable if we only focus on the benefits of being a non-smoker.  There is no need to focus on anything else because we’re not giving anything up.   We’re not missing out.  The cravings come and go and soon will be gone forever."      I agree with everything in this statement, with the exception of "Quitting smoking is not hard". I find it extremely hard. If it was not hard, more people would have successful quits. The trick is to remember the rest of this quote.        Whats your take?
It is one of the hardest things I have ever had to do! Now that I have some time under my belt, I hardly ever think about lighting a poison stick on fire and sticking it in my mouth. Currently, a friend is in the hospital suffering from lung cancer and doesn't have much time left...she quit smoking about 5-6 years before being diagnosed this past  April. The cancer metastasized to her brain....she is now a shell of her former self, is no longer verbal, cannot control bodily functions and needs round the clock care. To beat a crave, all I have to do is think about what she is going through...awful, awful, awful!
    Attitude towards quitting can make it as hard or as easy as you'd like.  There is some physical discomfort as your body frees itself of nicotine and the rest of the tars, yuck.  This is to most the "hard" part.  After that, there is a period of retraining yourself mentally.  This can be hard or easy.  You have to reach the point of accepting that you are never going to smoke again, you're done with it.  All successful quitters get there in their own fashion and time.  The NOPE pledge is a training tool in this.
    Attitude is the focus.  Yes it is hard at the beginning but when the process has gone by for several months you can see how easy it has become, just put your mind to it and realize in the end it is the best thing that you can do!!!
Quitting smoking was exceptionally hard for me--much harder, in fact, than I thought it would be, and I think I began the enterprise with relatively reasonable expectations.  But the rewards have also been exponentially greater than I ever imagined they could be--continuing to grow and help me even now, more than 17 1/2 years after my last cigarette (and about 16 years since my last craving of any kind).  A positive mindset is helpful, but if you're feeling miserable in the early weeks/months, that's OK.  Develop and trust a thoughtful and well-informed process that caters to your individual strengths, insist on absolute abstinence from smoking, and you WILL break through.  And when you do, I bet you'll be astonished at the ever-increasing benefits.         Christian99 17 1/2 Years Quit
    It's hard in the beginning but what life changing thing isn't? What are you prepared to pay for your freedom? If this was war, you might be asked to pay with your life but quitting smoking won't cost nearly that steep a price.      Look to your smoke free future. It's that bright, shiny thing straight ahead of you. Don't ever look back because your smokey past is done ... over!
    My take is that there was nothing easy or enjoyable about it. So glad to be past that first year!
    It took a full year and change before I was grooving in my new normal.  There were gnarly moments but, I didn't care,   my commitment was unwavering and I was willing to go through anything in order to be free.      I really considered the process as an adventure and I love adventures so, that provided some impetus    plus, reading peoples stories helped me to see the light at the end of the tunnel and celebrate little victories.       Learning about the Significance of Rewards was a great tool and v. fun, 'spoiling myself' for craves/triggers overcome. It was an enjoyable technique that helped smooth the rough edges of a quit.
Quitting  is awfully hard for me. I’m on Chantix and it is helping a lot but it doesn’t take away the habits I have formed over the decade I’ve smoked. Edited July 12 by Diane R
    What Sazerac said Diane  " reading peoples stories helped me to see the light at the end of the tunnel and celebrate little victories"      You can go backward on any pages on this forum and read people's stories and comments. You will be able to relate a lot of these comments to the feelings you're having with your own quit and then not only will you feel that you are not alone but you will come to believe that when others tell you it will get better then ..... it actually will. It just takes time is all. We are all the same. We go through the same process and providing we adhere to the NOPE principal, we all remain life long nonsmokers and are very comfortable as such

    Two groups of people tell The Big Fat Lie:  Successful Quitters: Boy that was THE HARDEST THING I ever did. I'll never do that again ...    Failed Quitter: Shit, that was TOO DAMNED HARD. I'll never make it.     Don't believe 'em, folks.   Quitting is as easy or as hard as you choose to make it.    It is, indeed, a choice.    You can choose to embrace The Suck and be happy about it ...    ... or you can fight it the whole way and live a life of difficult misery.  The Suckage Level is gonna be high at times for all of us. It's what makes us addicts.  The Big Choice is in how we react and keep drivin' on to The Goal.  We can make it easy on ourselves.   We can make it hard on ourselves.   It's as easy or as hard as we make it.  EZPZ
Sorry to hear about your friend @Rozuki....sending prayers ....     We are all different ..some take the nice quick route to Quit ...some of us take the slower route ...it's just about getting there ..in your own time ...   When I first Quit ,I thought it was very hard ...but not as hard as amputation....  Not as hard as spending time on a oxygen machine 16 hours a day ....    Whatever you are feeling Michelle ..is all Temporary ...and will pass ....
This lady never thought quitting was going to happen.   Here I am at 11 months smoke free and the thoughts of smoking again are a thing of the past.    I know it was very difficult for about two months.  I was very crabby and difficult to live with.   Now I feel more free and know I will never visit this part of my life again.    I love to see the newbies appear and help them to find the same freedom.
    I'm a very practical and scientific person (maybe even a little cynical).  I could never convince myself that it was all about my state of mind, and it could be as easy or as hard as I wanted it to be.  For me it was HARD.  Is there a way I can emphasis that word even more?  I felt that I had a real knot in my stomach for a long time.  It was like a physical kick in the gut and a non-stop mental obsession.   But despite it being really difficult, I did it.  I truly think if you go all in, there is nothing in this world that will prevent you from achieving your goals.  And the good news with quitting smoking is that time and distance do eventually erase the desire and make the quality of your life so much better.   So, easy or hard, it can be done.  It really must be done.
I read Alien Carr’s Easy Way book. It helped.  What helped me the most was really adopting the philosophy/ mantra of this forum. Not one puff...  I became quite the fan of an old poster on another forum & adopted his way of thinking.  Just make it through the day until my head hits the pillow. Wake up and say to yourself. I did it! I’m going to do it again.  Then do it.        For most- myself included- it sucked. Hard.  But when I fought like mad all day & made it to my pillow smoke-free another day. The joy of completing another smoke free day far outweighed the agony of fighting monster craves.        Post SOS when needed. It works.  So does NOPT/NOPE Edited July 12 by Lust4Life
    I wouldn't call the early stages of my quit "hard", more irritating than anything.  Dealing with the quitter's paradox: "I don't want to be a smoker but I would like to smoke a cigarette right now."  Those persistent, nagging thoughts about smoking.  The self-doubt and internal bargaining and negotiating...yeah, the beginning of the process was a pain in the ass.  Worth every bit of the effort and then some, but irritating.     I didn't really focus on the "hard" or "easy."  I stayed focused on the word "simple."  Don't put things in your mouth and set them on fire...this process could not be more simple.
Hello Everyone, I’ve been taking Chantix to quilting smoking. I’m on my 3rd week. So far it’s working. I’ve been a smoker for at least 40 years. This is my 3rd  attempt  To quit(hope 3rd time is the charm). I quit the first time for over a year and thought I could have one and stop. And at first I could. But I got to  confident  That I could only have one once in a while. Nope I can’t I’m  truly addicted to nicotine. I can’t have just 1 or 2. I know this now. I’m now down to a few cigarettes a day. Most of the time I don’t even smoke half of the cigarette. And it definitely doesn’t taste the same. I think I’m battling the habit at this point. Chantix has been a little tough on me. The  nausea is the worst of it. So yesterday I took a  dramamine  And it stopped the nausea. That has been the only side effect I’ve had. I have been very  tired but that’s  The nicotine withdrawal I know from the last time I quit. As anyone esle quit with Chantix?
    Hi Diane - Congratulations on making this choice!! I cannot give you any feedback on Chantix (i did cold turkey) but i have heard good things! Good luck, you can do this - remember you are stronger than the nicotine!  
Welcome aboard QuitTrain @Diane R. First off, well done to reaching the 3rd week of your quit. I have never used Chantix before so I have no experience on its side effects. Please consider seeing a doctor if Chantix gives you trouble. Maybe the following videos will help (I haven't seen the second one, found it in Joel's collection of videos on his channel, it may help though).     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27eei-r6BvQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZj9tEEkaEs     All the best and reach out to us in the SOS section at any time!!! Here's the thread on posting an SOS:  https://www.quittrain.com/topic/8-posting-an-sos/
Hello Diane, welcome.   I believe @Nancy quit with Chantix and has a long successful quit.  There may be others.    I, like @Christa326 quit cold turkey.   This site supports ALL quits.       Let us know when you quit and we will be great support.     In the meantime, watch the videos that @Ankush so kindly found for you  and continue with your education about nicotine addiction.  You may find this thread helpful 10 Ways To Effectively Use This Forum To Help Yourself Quit SmokingEdited July 11 by Sazerac
    Welcome aboard Diane, we have lots of successful quitters who used chantix. I quit the first time using it but didn't take it for the length of time recommended and relapsed. So my clue for you would be to take it for the time recommended which I believe is three months.     As far as the nausea I found that eating something as small as a mini donut before you take your pill worked great. You just want to have a little something in your stomach.    
    HI and welcome Diane I believe @JimHannoonen quit using this method too and he's been quit long term. Maybe he will chime in on this quit method too. I have also heard good things about it although some seem to get bad side effects while some don't. If it's working well for you ..... that's great! Stick around and you'll get awesome support here.
Oh haaaaaaay!       Yes, I quit with Chantix and initially, it was all sunshine and rainbows. It made one of the hardest things I'd ever do not so bad at all. I took it for a few weeks, set my quit date and that was that. I can't say that I wouldn't have been able to quit without it, but it helped a lot.       My issues started when I weaned myself off of the Chantix. I didn't have that chemical crutch anymore and had to deal with the reality that I couldn't smoke and that was hard for me. The mood swings and everything else that typically comes with quitting showed up. It was a rough patch, but I never smoked. Never even considered it. Not once.  After about the 9 month mark, I finally felt normal again. It was a rough road, but of course, it was worth it.     I got nauseous a time or two, but making sure I had food in my belly before I took it solved that problem.      At the end of the day, whether you stay quit or not is up to YOU. Chantix will help, but It's a decision YOU have to make and stick with NO MATTER WHAT. If you're committed, you won't smoke. If you're not committed, you will. It really is as easy as that.     I smoked for 30 years and was as addicted as anyone and here I am 2.5 year later, smoke free. If I can do it, you can do it. Stay strong, stick to your guns and you got it.
Thanks everyone for the support. While I am using Chantix I know I have to want to quit. I quit with laser treatments the first time and I was smoke free for well over a year. I just need a little help. I will keeping telling myself I won’t be a salve to cigarettes. When I really stop and think how much they run my life I’m quite pissed off. As I’m sure anyone who has ever smoked know they are calling the shots. I never went anywhere with making sure I had enough cigarettes. Since I don’t like to be controlled this should me a good tool for me. I’m ready to me done with them. Each time I think I need a cigarette that what I remind myself. Only 2 cigarette today so far. And I’m a heavy smoker. Also live with a smoker. Makes it a little harder. But he is good about not bringing them home. He has alway been able to not smoke when he’s home. Not me.
I quit using Chantix and celebrated 6 years free last week.  Always take Chantix with food...the only time I was nauseous was when I took it on an empty stomach.  Keep in mind that the Chantix takes the edge off withdrawal symptoms, but you still have to make the commitment.  Quitting can be uncomfortable, or sometimes even miserable, but it will not kill you and all symptoms are temporary.  You can do this...as you have discovered the hard way, we are all one puff away from a pack a day.
-ankush I’m under a doctors care with Chantix. I wouldn’t take it any other way. And it’s not for everyone. I have none of the other side effect or I won’t take it. Only nauseous, but my stomach can be a bit on the  sensitive side.Edited July 11 by Diane R
    I myself went cold turkey but I have seen others use Chantix  with success.  Whatever helps you to quit and using the medical approach may be of great benefit as long as you follow your Doctors orders.  Some that did not succeed with Chantix all stated that they had stopped using it too soon.  
I have seen that people who quit taking Chantix before the 3 months is up almost always start again. It’s not an option for me to give up. I have other health issues to deal with as well as quitting. So more  motivation to stop. Thanks everyone for all the support!

I have friends who have successfully quit with Chantix... Everyone I know who had success with it did the full 3 months.        I have a failed quit using it because it didn't agree with me. If you do get any odd side effects please see your doctor immediately don't down play them. Adverse reactions are very rare but they do happen. If things don't feel right, then please see the doctor.
    I’ve only had the sour stomach and that’s going away now. I alway take it with food. And a full glass of water. I’m hoping to be done with cigarettes my Monday. I’m starting to feel better each day. The  fatigue has been bad. And I know I still have a way to go, but I’ll make it.  And thanks for the support everyone.

I’m not having to many dreams I’ve had 1 or 2 there where funny dreams. No nightmares. And I do know I can’t smoke again. I’m addicted to nicotine. But the Chantix as allowed me to not care so much about smoking. I light 1 and don’t really want it. Everyone must find what works for them. If I could do it on mine own I would have by now. It’s not  convenient to be a smoker.
    "Everyone must find what works for them."   Absolutely correct! We all face the same challenges but we surpass those challenges using different methods.    The method that is right for us.
Despite my experience I'm not against Champix (what it's called down here) and I'm sorry if I gave that impression ... I know too many successful ex smokers who used Champix for it not to be worth trying if cold turkey is not for you. It's not like I didn't have an NRT crutch at the start of my quit. If it gets you over the line to freedom they go for it...I'm with you 100% of the way.
I wish I could just put them down. I’ve been a smoker for 40 plus years. Quitting is one of the hardest things to do and staying quit is even hard. I also live with a smoker. This makes it much harder. He is the one that could just put them down. He can come home and not smoke all weekend. I wish! Hope everyone has a great day.
    You're going to succeed Diane, between the chantix and us for support you got this  Enjoy your girl time 
    Hi Diane and welcome,   Everyone must find what works for them.  With that being said: I would reach into my goody bag and use whatever forms I had to ease the withdrawal !!!! I mean whatever!!!!! My motto is Do anything, any way, any how NOT TO TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!!!  And then I would celebrate OFTEN!!!! every half hour(lol) or hour!!!! seriously. I was making some life changing choices and I meant  business!!! I Can not let anything, or anyone get in the middle of my FREEDOM !!!! Hang in there Ms. Diane, read alot on here and stay close. YOU CAN do this              
Thanks Queen Bee! Well still on my mini vacation. I did ok yesterday. Had a few drinks. But I only smoke 3 cigarettes all day. So I hope the one I just lite and put out was my last. Didn’t even want it. And last night I thought I would have one before I went to bed and than picked it up had in my hand and decided I didn’t want or need it. So I think that was a win. I’m get closer to not having another puff! Edited July 14 by Diane R
You're well on your way, Diane!  I didn't use Chantix but I did cut down and "practice" not smoking in various situations for quite a while prior to actually quitting.  This method isn't recommended by most people, but I was such a heavy smoker for 40 years and was used to smoking everywhere (house, car, outside of work, etc.) so cutting back and getting used to not always being able to smoke was a huge help for me.  I imagine cutting back with Chantix helps in somewhat the same way, with the big bonus of making you have less desire to smoke.  Whatever works for you is the best way to get through this, and it sounds as if you are determined to make this your final quit.   We'll be rooting you on all the way!
Thanks Jordan7! There is no cookie cutter recipe to quit! We are all different and what works for some don’t for everyone. Habit are hard to break too. Not just the addiction. I unfortunately have both. When you do anything for 40 years to hard to just stop. It becomes a part of everyday life. At lest my not running to smoke every time I feel stressed. And that a big step for me. I’m coming here and reading others post.
Women Who Smoke At Risk of Vulval Cancer    27 June 2019    By Frances Hardy    In the UK, 58 women are diagnosed and 21 die each day from gynaecological cancers. Here a doctor explains the impact smoking can have on a woman's body For many people, the idea of developing cancer is hard to comprehend.   Yet young female smokers are at particular risk of developing the disease – in parts of their body they might not even know could be affected by their habit.   Dr Jeff Foster, a private GP based in Leamington Spa, explains: “Smoking is a serious risk factor for many cancers including lung, breast and throat. But it’s easy to forget it is having the same impact all over the body.”  What Does Smoking Do to Your Reproductive Organs?   The Impact of Smoking on Male and Female Fertility  Gender and Smoking: How Men and Women Differ    In particular, smoking is a risk factor for gynaecological cancers. In the UK, 58 women are diagnosed and 21 die each day from one of these cancers, which includes womb, ovarian, cervical, vaginal and vulval.    This last is probably the least known type - yet vulval cancer is diagnosed in 1,000 women each year, according to the Eve Appeal, the charity which specialises in gynaecological cancers.     Mostly found in women over 60 – although younger cases are becoming more common – vulval cancer has been linked to the human papilloma virus (HPV) infection as well as a weakened immune system. It can also be due to a skin condition called lichen sclerosus.   And according to Cancer Research UK, researchers have found a clear link between vulval cancer and smoking. Researchers have found a clear link between vulval cancer and smoking   This is partly because smoking weakens our immune system so that it’s harder to get rid of infections such as HPV which cause cancer.   It is also possible, says Cancer Research UK, that the harmful substances in tobacco damage cells in the vulva directly and so lead to the development of vulval cancer.  Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is a risk factor for vulval cancer as well as cervical cancer. It is possible that being a smoker may mean that you are less able to get rid of the HPV infection from your body. One of the dangers of this type of cancer is that its intimate location means women may not notice early symptoms, so diagnosis comes later than it should. “Many women will only be diagnosed with vulval cancer,” Dr Foster explains, “when they are examined for something else, like a repeat smear test.”      However, there may be earlier signs, including a new itch or sore patch, a lump or swelling on the labia, or a burning pain when you pass urine. "Women should never be embarrassed to contact their GP if they experience any of these," he adds.  Treatment is surgery, Dr Foster says, unless the cancer has spread into lymph nodes. “Vulval cancer doesn’t usually spread too far so chemo is not often needed although a course of radiotherapy may be used.” Survivors of vulval cancer are grateful but tell of operations which have left them feeling less feminine as a result.  Clare Baumhauer, in her 40s, from Kent, explained in her blog that radiotherapy had sent her into an early menopause, saying: “In May 2016 I had the surgery to remove a tumour from my perineum, but they couldn’t get clear margins so I had radiotherapy but unfortunately it had spread to my lymph nodes so I then had two further operations on my lymph nodes and more radiotherapy. Giving up smoking is essential  "Which put me straight into the menopause and I now have lymphedema in both my legs, pelvis and abdomen, among other side effects.” On the whole, survival rates are good. According to Cancer Research UK, for all women with vulval cancer more than 80 percent will survive their cancer for five years or more after diagnosis. "Giving up smoking is essential," says Dr Foster, to "prevent further cell damage and to help your body recover faster."    “Better still,” he says, “young women could be encouraged to give up smoking before cell changes make cancer inevitable.”
    It was horrific lol. But it passed. I'm still wearing a patch. I can sleep with them on as long as I put them on in the early afternoon instead of evening. It does help during the day though. Its just that mornings are my strongest craving. But I've been up for an hour and haven't seriously thought of smoking. Yay. I'm going to one of my recovery meetings at noon where many people smoke and its sort of "normalized" but I'll be with a nonsmoking family member so I won't be tempted to bum one. I'll do my best to remember why I'm quitting, look at smoking as something horrible and destructive that endangers my life instead of romancing it. Thats what it will take when I'm at a meeting. Its NOT okay, its NOT "normal", its NOT something that I do because everyone else is doing it, I will NOT push down the fear and knowledge that I'm endangering my life. I will remember why I'm doing this, and so will ya'll!
    I had my never smoker husband go places with me the first few months because I didn't trust myself not to stop and buy a pack so good on you for taking a nonsmoking family member  I also used my air cigarette when cravings got really bad. I simply pretended I was holding an actual cigarette and then went through the motions of "smoking it". I may have looked like an idiot but it sure worked to trick my mind into thinking it was getting the real thing  
    Thats actually a big help...I used a medium sized straw for a while last time. Who cares if it looks silly...and it probably doesn't because I think most people know its a substitute for a cig. I'm a sneaky person...if I decide I want to smoke I will actually insist on going somewhere alone...sometimes when I make the decision to smoke, the barriers I put down for myself go out the window. Its like...I can put all these barriers up but I have the power to take them down if I want to smoke. Thats why its so critical to remember why I want to smoke and honor that commitment to myself. Must remember that.
    You are going to have smokey thoughts, no doubt about it.   Push them out of your head, replace them with a thought or sight of beauty...   Look !  the light on that leaf, the shadow on that wall, the color of that edge of sky etc. Think of a loved one's smile or laughter.  Think of anything/everything that brings beauty to your senses.      The sooner you identify smokey thoughts and replace them, the sooner your brain will reward you.
    I changed my morning routine completely.  Not so much a choice as it was a necessity.       So much of my morning routine revolved around smoking it made change unavoidable.       Starting a quit is the perfect time to create new habits.  You're already out of your comfort zone and things don't quite feel normal.  Replace smoking time with something more healthy and productive.        Out with the old, in with the new.
    "I can put all these barriers up but I have the power to take them down if I want to smoke﻿."       You said this above @MichelleDoesntSmokeAnymore and it's true. You have the power over whether you smoke or don't smoke, just like we all do so use  ALL that power to not smoke this time. Change your old thinking and channel all that power to your quit  
    Thank u all....very helpful
    I wouldn't kneel down and suck on a car's tailpipe.  I hold my breath when I walk through a cloud of exhaust. Probably safer than smoking or vaping.
Let's all throw in those cancer sticks we haven't smoked since we Quit ...  I throw in my 43,257....burn you buggers !!!    In honour of all the folks taken far too early !!!

868 days for you Roz, i just looked at your quit date and 2/10/2010 was my orig quit date. You learn from my mistake (blown 9/24 2012)
1,685 days.         I can't believe I used to smoke.  I was around some smokers today and the smell was horrible.       Stick with it if you are early on in your quit.  Things get so much better with time and the freedom is definitely worth any early struggles.

My stat is I was quit all day today.    That's 1 more day quit than I ever had when I was a smoker.
@Rozuki, if your mom smoked a pack a day (20 cigs), at $3.00 a pack ( I was guessing) and quit July 20, 1991:       Oh and congratulations to your mom @Rozuki
I've been quit for 17 1/2 years, and by a conservative estimate I have not spent  $48,106.50 on cigarettes that I otherwise would have spent during that time.   That's assuming, of course, that I would have survived the widowmaker heart attack and cardiac arrest I experienced (at age 40) seven years AFTER I quit, which every physician I've encountered tells me would not have happened had I still been a smoker.           Christian99 17 1/2 Years QuitEdited July 4 by Christian99

Eugh :D
Disgusting!
So gross....
I damn near puked watching this. Why did I ever smoke again?!
And where does all that tar go?   HERE!   It is gross. I know. But for those of us with early quits this may be a good reminder of what and why we are doing...
Thanks for this. I mean I understood it damaged lungs but I don't think I ever actually connected the blackness on our lungs was actually a tar based product (in my head smoke blackens things so I didn't consider tar as well).  Just reinforces a great decision by all of us really. x
    Smoking kills ....emphysema kills .....don't leave it ...quit now !!!
How to motivate yourself to quit smoking and what steps did you take?  
I was fairly typical I think, in that I chose to ignore the obvious risks and damage associated by tobacco.  I ignored them because I was addicted. I ignored them because I was frightened. I was frightened of failing.  So, I would laugh, I would tell people 'Live life! Enjoy every moment! We all have to die some time of something.'  I bought Allen Carrs book 'the EasyWay' and I read it. (Not for the first time) I sat down and really thought about smoking. About mortality. I thought about my wife. About how she had moved away from her beloved London and her beloved family to support me and my work. I thought about COPD. I thought about my wife as a carer. I thought about dying. I though about my wife all alone. I decided that I was right. We do all have to die of something. We should enjoy every moment. Did I really enjoy smoking? Did I need to hurry my death along? No. And No.  I simply followed the instructions in the book. I chose a date. I committed to quitting smoking and celebrating that quit immediately. I quit on vacation. My wife still smoked. So on the first morning, after breakfast, we carried on our routine and went up to the terrace for our after-breakfast cigarette and espresso; the obvious difference being that I did not smoke. She was worried, watching me from the corner of her eye. Me? I was fine. I quit.  As the vacation continued, my wife decided that she would quit too, and smoke her last cigarette before we got the flight home. Did I crave? Yes. Sometimes. Did I sometimes rely on support from like minded people online? Yes (mostly lunatics here!). How do I feel now? Absolutely fantastic.
I kept picturing my kids growing up without their mammy, they were what I quit for,   I watched videos on you tube of people dying from lung, throat, mouth cancer etcI changed my morning routine because that was always the hardest for me, my favourite smoke was first thing in the morning when kids were still asleep, so I'd get into the shower first instead and put loads of body moisturiser on, I found when I smelled yummy it really helped keep the craves at bay because I didn't want to ruin the nice smell with the stench of cigs.
I was self motivated for the first week.  I quit just to see if I could.Then, I 'discovered' Joel's videos,  they are now on site HERE .Once I educated myself about my addictionthere was simply no turning back.I had many patterns to change and one by one was able to dissociate the tobacco habit from my life, sometimes by tricking myself, sometimes through education, sometimes through fierce will, and sometimes just slogging through one more smoke free day.Commitment to NOPE and education were  two major motivations..
In one of Joel's videos he says that he hopes to screw up smoking for us forever. lol  It's true because once we know the truth, we can never look at smoking the same, even those who go back to smoking.  Yep, Joel screwed up smoking for all of us.  I'm going to find that video because it's a good one.  :) My motivation to quit was out of extreme guilt that I was robbing my kids of time with their father because I was on my way to an early death.  It's this very reason that I told my doctor that I wanted to quit and could quit but I enjoyed it too much (he laughed at that called me on my bullshit).  When I told him that my daughter was the most important thing in my life he responded "No she's not.  Smoking is the most important thing in your life so don't sit here and tell me that your daughter is because she's not.  You're an addict and the only reason why you're not out stealing to feed your addiction is because cigarettes are legal." Wow.  Tough words to hear but it made me look at smoking in an entirely different way.  For the first time I had to admit the truth that I was an addict.  He cared enough to piss me off to get me to save my own life.  After I left his office I remember lighting up a cigarette and thinking that smoking will never be the same again.  I thought about what he said and he was right.  I was putting smoking before my family because of all the times they wanted me to stay indoors to play a game, watch a movie or do something else and I had to get up and leave them to go and inhale poison.  As soon as I quit this huge weight was lifted from me and that burden was gone.  Sure, I may die from a smoking related disease or I may not but I do know one thing for damn sure; I will not die a smoker.  I used to smoke.  That is all. If you're lurking and are thinking about quitting, please realize that you're an addict just like a junkie or an alcoholic.  Treat it like and addiction and take control back of your life.  As soon as you quit you'll feel better.  Focus on how your blood no longer is polluted with carbon monoxide, your blood pressure lowers and you instantly are less likely to die of a sudden heart attack.  Do you know how many people are found dead with a cigarette next to their body?  A lot.  They died as they were puffing on a cigarette.  I don't know about you but I wouldn't want to be found dead that way. 
" You're an addict and the only reason why you're not out stealing to feed your addiction is because cigarettes are legal."   This. Newbies do me a favor read this one sentence to yourself over and over. Then go over and watch these documentaries. When I was in the throes of withdrawal I wondered "how the hell is this legal?!?!" many times.We are all addicts but the good news is that we can break free once we become educated. 
I got really bad pneumonia and refused to go to the hospital like my doctor wanted because I knew they wouldn't let me smoke. I came home and tried to smoke the rest of the night sick as hell and coughing up a lung with each inhale. I stood there in the parking lot (only place I was allowed to smoke at my apt) and it hit me.  I like breathing, and I am too damn smart to be standing there hacking and desperately trying to take a drag,looking like a sick fool instead of in the hospital getting better. At the very least my kids deserve better than that in their mother.  After that I just started one hour at a time. On day 6 I found you guys and now I am heading to a month with loads of education and support.
when i found out my daughter was pregnant with my first grandchild....this little angel right here..  that's when I vowed that this little girl was never going to know her mom-mom as a smoker.  I kept my promise and will continue to do so.  Unfortunately...she spends much time at the back door asking her pop pop to come inside.  That's sad...and I am so grateful that's not me.  I picked up the dusty Allen Carr book on my shelf that had periodically haunted me...and I started reading...again.  This time though...I was smarter and searched for online support...and found it...along with the Joel videos...which i watched...over and over and over again.
What made me decide to finally give up smoking was when I went for my yearly eye exam (diabetic so have to go yearly) and I did not hear the usual "everything looks great; no sign of diabetes in the eyes."  Instead I heard "there is some very slight hemorrhaging from the diabetes in both eyes".  When I went home, I researched how to stop the progression of this eye vessel hemorrhaging and everything I read said QUIT SMOKING....DO NOT SMOKE...NO SMOKING.  So, since I value my eyesight, I decided to make a plan that day.  My family and I were going on a cruise vacation to the Pacific Northwest in mid-May, and I vowed that when I came back from vacation I would quit that weekend.   I chose to use an e-cigarette to quit.  I had tried every method out there (except drugs like Chantix) and never succeeded much beyond a day or two.  I also knew in my mind and heart and soul that I had to succeed this time in order to improve things for my health.  I did quit that weekend, and I have not had not one puff since then.  I do still use an e-cig; perhaps not as often as I did in the beginning.  I do not use nicotine in my e-juice, just the juice.  When I'm stressed or just getting a craving (which are getting very weak now), it's there and I use it.  I have been nicotine free for 6 months and plan to continue the remainder of my life.  I know at some point I will stop with the e-cigarette as well, but until I feel confident I can go without it, I will continue with it. I hope this helps someone out there who is trying to decide to quit or not.  Quitting was the best decision and best action I've ever taken in my life.  I always thought it would be impossible for me because I was that addicted.  But I found out that if you really are resolved to being smoke-free, then you can conquer anything.
Although I had smoked for 52 years....I had never considered my self as a drug addict.....To me I was just a smoker....It was Allen Carr who motivated me .....he made me see smoking for what it really is...All the excuses I had used over the years...He made me take a long look at myself....and question what I really was getting out of it.....It turned out to be nothing....I made a promise to quit to special people in my life....and I intend to keep that promise...
    bumpity bump
I set a date. I circled it in red and told myself daily that was the day I would quit smoking.  (Mother's Day was close enough and appropriate as my kids were a big factor in my decision.)    I made a quit list and put it right at eye level on the fridge...read it daily; it's still there and I still do:)   The day before I quit, I divided what was left in the pack I had (you know, the ol' romance). I actually smoked my "last one" at 6:30pm that Saturday at my mom's.  Then that was it. I was a non-smoker the next day when I woke up, and have been ever since. Plus, I read like a crazy person about nicotine addiction and learned that I'm no better than any other drug abuser.
Realizing that I was now over 40, I figured it's probably a good time to quit taking my health for granted. That was the nagging thought that was always on my mind every time i lit up.    Plus, I had racked up a few "four hour quits" over the years.       Steps - One thing that helped was hearing someone I know say "I gotta have my ambien!" I thought, "Am I as hooked on tobacco? That's pitiful!" I mean jeeze!    I wondered what life would be like without needing a cigarette all the time. I chain smoked when I wasn't at work. Last time i wondered what it would be like to do something big, my life  changed for the better.     So I was gonna quit on Oct 2nd 2017 but of course it only lasted four hours. I thought, "Alright, I will allow myself three cigarettes a day (down from 30) but Friday I need to quit quit. I gave away the rest of my smokes (about three packs worth), got rid of my cigarette machine (one of those top-o-matic type machines) and cigarette tubes, and that Friday Oct 6 at 5:30 AM, took my last hit.      I was highly motivated to quit. I was having problems breathing, I was coughing a lot, breath rattling at night worse than ever, I was scared. I used to joke that I would probably die by age 60. But that meant less than 20 years to live, if my guesstimate were accurate.      If the "11 minutes off your life per cigarette" average is anywhere close to true, I have lost about three years. No big deal but the years I am around will be better without smoking those stupid-ass cigarettes.     What does my doctor say? Besides telling me to get my diet under control (groan), she says my lungs sound perfect. I doubt they ARE perfect but at least they are not getting worse.
I would light up in my car on my way to my office. Three drags in, I would be coughing up a lung and put it out. 5 minutes later, I would be relighting it, and hacking again. Once I finally made it through a few, I felt fine. On the way home, I looked at the pack. Only three left. After these three, I will quit. And of course, I stopped and bought a carton. After doing this a few times, i again was on the way home and looked to see again I had three left. This time I forgot to get the carton. I was out on my deck. I looked up and asked God for the strength to make the decision.  I promised i would go through it all on my own if he just helped me decide. BOOM! I felt it immediately.  Call it inner strength, or Divine intervention.  It does not matter to me. I did not smoke those last three. I threw them out. A week later I joined QSMB and never looked back.Edited October 16, 2018 by gonfishn21Mis spelling

    Quitting smoking, while may be challenging at times is ultimately do-able and wasn't as difficult as anticipated.       I committed myself to quitting 'for a year', jumped into it as an adventure and it turned into a most rewarding one in so many ways.
    Made a promise to myself ....Take smoking off the table no matter what .....this meant no more excuses to light up ....ever....
    Yeah ... first "The Letter" from AARP for Sarge's official "Too Old For This Shit Discount Card" came earlier in the week ...Now this from Phillip Morris ...   EZPZ
That's so odd because I got something from Marlboro too today. Two coupons for $1.50 off a pack of cigarettes! I use to get those things all the time in the mail for $5.00 off a carton and I hadn't gotten one since my birthday in March! You would think they would have figured out that I hadn't used a Marlboro coupon in over three years and stop sending me those things
    WTF?  I guess they think you’re still gambling w your health... Desperate SOBs. 
    How do these people know your name, address and DOB?.....I'd be more freaked out about that tbh. That just creeps me out... Maybe it's just a US thing?....I don't ever remember the tobacco companies doing give aways or vouchers down here. That's so outside my realm.....      What's the AARP letter? Is it like a senior's card to give you discounts on things like the movies?
    We had vouchers ..a loooooong time ago ....to recieve gifts ...like a free lighter ...lol....   So I should imagine they would need a address to send it ..and as a numpty smoker who needed another lighter ...say no more ...all the addresses are on file somewhere I bet !
    That wasn't a thing here in my time as a smoker...maybe earlier though.

Used a credit or debit card at a tobacco shop which would record what and how often you buy.     That data got shared with Philipp Morris.   Always be careful what you do online folks.     I did get an AARP letter almost on the day of my 50th birthday though.   I joined of course do get all of the old fart senior discounts.     Edited July 7 by Wayne045
Eff all these tobacco companies I can almost see their lecherous advertisements " Feeling low and alone?    Are you old and all by  yourself... With no one to wish you on your birthday or your anniversary?   Have no fear... Phillip Morris is here...   We never forget your birthday or your anniversary.. We're here to encourage you to your deatheversary....   So go ahead have a Phillip Morris today..." Eff 'em How the hell did they get info on addresses and birthdays anyway?   *Just a sarcastic take on how tobacco companies may try to feed off the aged, nothing else*Edited July 7 by Ankush
The thing that surprises me most is that this "club" (AARP) declares people 50 years of age as old!     Isn't 50 the new 40?
They got my info because years ago they had a promotion called Marlboro miles. You saved up your miles and then bought things with them from their catalog. You had to fill out the order form complete with DOB to prove you were 18. I bought a Marlboro backpack, duffle bag, mini binoculars and a few other things with my miles. Since there was no internet back then it was all done through snail mail and I've been receiving things from them ever since.

I had a massive list of things I thought I would miss and thought I could not live without before I quit.       For example, I thought:     - I would be stressed as I thought cigarettes relieved stress   - I would lose my identity  - I wouldn't know what to do with myself when waiting for the bus or train  - What was I going to do on ad breaks in the middle of a film or programme? - I would be less sociable  - What if anything negative happened in my life? I wouldn't have a way of dealing with it with no cigarettes    - How on earth would I ever go out again??  - And have a drink? What about when it's summer and I'm having a beer outside? Surely I can't not smoke then?   - Eeek, what about holidays?    - Oh and my darling morning coffee, that always goes with a cigarette. Surely I can't separate those two?       I also thought:         - I will never be able to sit through a 3 course meal in a restaurant without cigarettes in between courses - Or go out to a bar with my friends without stepping outside all the time  - Or go through a day at work without smoking. An absolutely absurd idea    - Or go to the airport without frantically smoking a million cigarettes before going through security checks and not being able to smoke until I get to my destination  - Or get out of bed and not have a cigarette as the first activity of every single day      - Or ever feel like I'm not a slave and ruled by addiction      Luckily for me and most other ex smokers it turns out every single one of these assumptions were wrong. I can't even tell you how much better my life is now. But it can actually be a very vulnerable state when you quit, as all these habits and perceived comforts are changing in one go. Edited July 2 by greenlight
So many of those applied to me too. Especially when drinking or being around people who smoke. Great post greenlight Edited July 2 by jillar

    - I was scared as to how I would deal with stress if I quit - I was scared that negative things (from people) in my life wouldn't stop if I quit smoking        Minor things    - I was worried I would never get over the fact that I need a cigarette after meals - I was worried I wouldn't be able to go out of my house several hours at a go without needing a cigarette (since I used to avoid carrying cigarettes when I went out with my family)       Stress is still there, negative things don't stop, but at least I quit smoking. And, I eventually got used to not having a cigarette after meals. I still get stressed when I step out of my house (whether its a short period or a long period), but fight off the urge, if I do get it. Nevertheless, at least I quit smoking.

Must have been gross to sit there in all that smoke... So happy you got even more confirmation that you will never go there again.

This was part of my quit as well, that I decided I would never smoke again, regardless of what happens and this includes really, really difficult losses. I'm pleased you didn't want to smoke at all even then and I hope you're doing alright otherwise too

But, from the moment I quit I knew,  in my heart of hearts,     I would not miss the bondage    and all the gnarly craves/persistent  triggers  only solidified my pursuit of Freedom.      The me that emerged was a sincerely confident and strong woman.     nice post @greenlightEdited July 2 by Sazerac

    My fear was that not having that first smoke of the morning was going to be an awful way to start the day and that it would be all downhill from there.     Most every other misguided fear mentioned in this thread also applied to me.        I really let myself get snared in the addiction.
    Most all of what was posted but the two big things were my morning coffee on the porch or when I was driving (I always "enjoyed" smoking while on the road).  I seemed to have gotten past all those but I still stay on guard!!!

I still can't understand how my non-smoking gf at the time did not dump me for this (I was a non-smoker when she met me but I started again). I'd go to bed stinking of a cigarette and get out of it in the morning to have my fix. Ugh...
    The group of "outcasts" I smoked with at every social event. We were the ones who stepped outside to sneak a smoke outside. I met some very nice people in this arena. The conversations were great. In fact, I still miss these impromptu meetings. 
    Thought I'd miss my answer to everything: boredom,  fear,  social akwardness, lonelyness etc. etc. All things existential. Turned out to be a big fat lie, BUT: One I have to remind myself over and over about. At times its frustrating, but still a million times better than be back at nasty, pride consuming smoking.

    When I can stand the stench,    I still go outside to talk to people,   to look at the stars,   to gather my thoughts.  Smoking is not a part of it anymore, that is all.

Smoking is not a part of it anymore, that is all.               That brought back a memory from the very early days of my quit.  Had a moment where I thought about stepping outside and taking a little pause for the cause.  Got a bit frantic as I thought about how much I was going to miss that.      Then I calmed down a bit and reminded myself that smoking is not a prerequisite for stepping outside for a moment.  Oh yeah, people who don't smoke go outside too.     I don't miss being a newbie, but it was a time when basic truths could feel like a revolutionary breakthrough.

    This is a great question and I've been straining to come up with an answer and have none.  I was tired of the social stigma, the smell, the cost, the fact that my day revolved around when/where I could smoke, jonesing for a smoke when on a flight or any other situation that I couldn't smoke, standing out in rain/cold to smoke.        It was frustrating that I was stuck in this addiction and was dead-set on quitting and getting my freedom back and have a real peace of mind (not the false peace of mind when you finally relieve a craving by lighting up).       So my answer is nothing.   Don't miss it or anything about it AT ALL.
    Worried about going to the loo.  How do you make morning stuff happen without a cigarette.  I thought I'd miss my 'me time with my cig' but there are other much better ways to find me time.

    I decided to quit the day before I did quit so there wasn't much time to think about anything let alone one specific thing I would miss. There was just a dark cloud of trepidation as to how I would possibly be able to quit doing something I loved doing and had done all my life pretty much. Funny how one's perspective can change so completely in such a short period of time. I don't miss anything about smoking now - nothing!

    Keep busy.... It does help ....bumping this ..feel free to add ...
I lurked here and learned all I could about addiction.  I danced wildly. I walked willfully.    I sang, took screaming showers, went down to the tracks and primal screamed when a train rolled by (love that). I yelled, 'FREE YOUR HEAD' over and over and over.  I buffed out my fingernails, my toenails to a gloss.    I did a super detail house clean, top to bottom.  Everything smelled so good.   Washed all my clothes, shined all my boots. Drawers were artistically arranged, closets compulsively organized.     Folders of personal ephemera were sorted,  letters bound with ribbon to save.   The purge had no boundaries and I threw out a ton of detritus.      It also looked like I had gone to 'the agent orange school of gardening'    there wasn't a 'weed' anywhere, everything horribly neat and tidy.  Thankfully, I resumed my happy garden to it's riotous nature    but, I do miss that neat-nik woman keeping my house spic 'n span, where'd she go ?      Thanks for bumping this, @Doreensfree   great to see the 'old' faces.   I was still lurking back then and these were some of my heroes, two months later, I joined with a 10 month quit under my belt.           Edited July 2 by Sazerac

    I think that as you gain confidence in your successful quit you will find that the skills used in quitting can be applied to other aspects in your life.        For example, the notion of H.A.L.T. are you Hungry, Angry (which can be switched to emotional), Lonesome, Tired.        To this day, I turn to this technique for a variety of reasons and situations.  While it may not solve the underlying issue, it certainly alleviates compounding any distress by addressing these issues    and I am better able to solve the problem if I am, at least, fed and well rested.       Another example of using a quitting skill is deep breathing !   an excellent technique to calm myself and think more clearly.   A conscious flow of Oxygen is a panacea, the handiest of magic elixirs !        Just knowing that we have the ability to change,    and acknowledging  the proof that we Have Changed, (we quit smoking!)   gives us encouragement to change other things in our life.      I know many of us have changed other aspects in our lives with 'quit smoking' skills.   The self-confidence acquired in quitting, especially, encouraged me in any endeavor.        What skills have you learned in quitting smoking    and how have you applied them to your fabulous nicotine free life ?
    I learned a lot about having empathy for people and their struggles.  I am more kind towards people, a good transferable skill useful in many parts of my life.         At the same time, I learned to recognize junkie thinking and reasons for it.  Also a good transferable skill that can keep me from having empathy for someone who doesn't deserve it.
    I stopped making excuses and addressed a major issue head-on.       I stopped telling myself that I couldn't do it and put my head down and did it.     I made a commitment to myself and followed through.     I stayed focused on the big picture and wouldn't allow temporary feelings or events put me off course.      I built positive momentum for myself, success begets success, and used that momentum to make improvements in other areas of my life.        The basic tenets of a successful quit can be laid out as a blueprint for success in most any endeavor.
    Our friend, Joel Spitzer, has a great vid    
    Ok...when I quit, I had a plan....date and time and supplies.   My husband quit spontaneously.  I am trying to help a friend quit....she has tried several times spontaneously "this is the last one"...... Everyone is different of course but how did you do it ? plan.....no plan. ?
A plan gets my vote (A plan to fight the craves/triggers)Edited June 27 by Whispers
    I didn't have a plan because I didn't know I should have one but I knew I needed to quit so I prepared by not smoking in the areas I smoked in. That enabled me to disassociate those places with smoking and as a result I could go into those areas and not crave a smoke.    Your friend is lucky to have you to get clues from. I would also recommend telling them about us so we can help support them 
    Plain and simple I had no plan.  I was fortunate enough to find the forum and do it with support.   I think the biggest part of quitting is realizing that it is possible and everyone has the power within to do it.   I would advise your friend to do the homework and read all the information available here.      Hopefully it will help ease her into the process needed to quit.
Great to see you, Parsley,  congrats on your 10 months of Freedom ! Hope you have escaped all the flooding in your part of the world.       I quit on a whim and as a personal challenge to myself. I was completely ignorant about addiction.  I lurked here and there, educating myself and joined the QTrain in the tenth month, or so, of my quit,  thankful to everybody that had shared their stories and for the incredible resource of information compiled here.
I was already fed up of being a smoker but never managed to quit, Joel's videos encouraged me to take the step of going cold turkey and so I made a plan. Big part of my plan was to join a forum for people who wanted to or had quit smoking. The other part of my plan was to keep make myself mentally prepared for the withdrawal of the first 3 days. I had come to know to have a lot of juice and water (during the first 3 days) and to do deep breathing. Once I joined the Train, I just stuck to the NOPE pledge and stayed quit a day at a time (and am still staying quit). The support I received during the initial days of joining the Train was also very helpful.        Bottom line - every person will have their own way of quitting smoking.
    I started reading everything to know what I was up against.  Everything I felt or experienced was laid out and explained by those that had already quit; there is plenty of information (and support) online. An educated quit is a strong quit.  
    "Plans" for quitting are generally code for "procrastination."  "I can't quit until I've got my Magic Plan in place ... "   Just quit now.  EZPZ
    I really had no plan at the beginning only a desire to quit.  As I went into my quit during the first week I set up kind of plan and that was to educate myself more and to find support -- that is how I got here!!!
    Thank you for all of your responses I have in fact told her about this site . And I agree not one shoe fits all .   Still very wet here as far as flooding goes, it has been a dreadfully wet year I really feel bad for the farmers it's not good  Sorry for the multiple post but I'm not on here much just wanted you to know I bought an opal and diamond ring with my money saved from not smoking !
    One more thing that I remember from when I was getting ready to quit it is true that it is a lot of procrastination I couldn't be this day and it couldn't be that day and it couldn't be this day and it couldn't be that day, so I could have avoided that if I had just done it spontaneously.
"A goal without a plan is just a dream"     Someone said that once..        You have to have a plan. You wouldn't just hop in a boat and attempt to sail to Thailand would you? No, you would plan the trip. Map it out and pack supplies, etc.     Quitting smoking is the same.       Benjamin Franklin supposedly once said, “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail."         
    I understand what you're saying about a plan and I was successful with the plan , because I finally put down my foot and did it but it sounds like some people have a plan that drags on forever . So there again I guess there are many ways to do things whatever works I guess is the only thing that matters 
My first quit i just quit with no plan outside of the words of a good friend who had been quit, he said just get through the first month and you're in the clear. I believed him and that quit was quite easy but blown at 2 1/2 years. I wasn't educated on the addiction and had no plan to face the triggers and craves as i really thought i was done with them. This quit i learned and have that plan to face the triggers/craves head on if they ever come back and i educated myself and i also learn from others stories. Move a muscle, change a thought is golden for me . BTW my friend who gave me that advice back in 2010 has blown his quit as still smoking to day(just get through the month)..           FWIW
    Absolutely! And wholeheartedly! This site made my quit happen for me , I fell off the wagon once and came back and you've helped me through and I am here smoke-free as is my husband ! Alan Carr's book was also huge to me 
I just re-read my first post here:   'Hi there, this is me introducing myself. First time here,  but not new to this whole quitting thing. Have been smoking on and off since I was 15 (in my mid-thirties right now). My most serious quit lasted for three whole years. I am sweating carrots  (yes, in Holland we do that when we are afraid) by the thought alone, to start this journey all over again. I am not so sure how to handle it this time. I feel like I know everything there is to know  and still don't feel confident enough. In the past I used to read a lot about addiction, fear, etc. I bought different kinds of cleansing﻿﻿﻿﻿ tea, drank water until I became a water balloon, tried to meditate and then always ended up failing miserably. I have a history of depression and anxiety. I also have ﻿the experience of becoming calmer and much more relaxed at non-smoking life, but only gradually after the first year. I know it will take time. I know I want to take that time. And still I am terrified.  My quit date is next friday, 24-08-2018. I shall look around a bit, hopefully i﻿t will motivate me. I do not need willpower or pride, but faith. That much I know..'        So, not really a plan, 'just' a strong desire. I think thats mainly what got me through so far. For me, every phase is so different and I have no golden rule exept  not lighting the damn thing.
I had a plan, but it turned out to be pretty much useless.  For instance: I spent a lot of time thinking about how I was going to deal with being around other people smoking.  Then I quit and found that I was indifferent to other people smoking.  The sight of someone smoking and the smell of the cigarette had no affect on me either negative or positive.     I don't like nitpicking over semantics, but I would go with preparation over planning when starting the quitting process.  Learn about the nicotine trap, the psychology of addiction, and the misguided "beliefs" that lead to us "needing" a cigarette.  If you're firmly rooted in the fundamentals you can sort everything else out with ease.          6 hours ago, sgt.barney said:               "Plans" for quitting are generally code for "procrastination."          "I can't quit until I've got my Magic Plan in place ... "               I know a guy who has been "planning" on quitting for over two years now.  He has all the information he needs.  I think at this point he's waiting for a Bigfoot to ride by on a unicorn and deliver the magic code for quitting.
    ^^^^^ Boo I like your idea of going with preparation -- it is kind of what I did.  Sometimes if you put a Plan into place and one little thing goes wrong can lead to making excuses for not completing the plan -- so I go with preparation!!!!

    No plan whatsoever.  Went to bed and committed to quit the next morning.  The only weapon in my arsenal was to berate myself for being a weak "kitty" (insert synonym) whenever I felt I might cave in.  True story.  And it worked.
    I planned many times to quit.  I planned and made an appointment with a hypnotist and that plan failed.  I planned and made an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic for their smoking cessation and went to one appointment - that plan failed.  I planned to quit this day and planned to quit that day.  I would buy the patches and would use half before returning to smoking.   I even tried the gum.   When I found the forum, I started reading and decided that I wanted to be a part of this group.  I just stopped.  My only plan now is to continue smoke free.   I do not know what the magic formula of this forum is.  I did start to have a high regard for the people fighting to save lives.  I wanted to give them success.  I could not let them down.     
    Some people use a Quit "toolbox"         
I quit suddenly in the middle of the day without a plan. It's like something just flipped in the right position in my head and I was just done. I was sick of it and increasingly annoyed at myself for previously blowing a nearly year-long quit due to basically getting cocky, i.e. "I've now beaten this addiction, I can smoke socially if I feel like it and leave it at that + all the other BS lies I fed myself so I would be "allowed" to smoke again. Of course that social smoking plan quickly turned into me smoking full time just like I had done before... duh. So this last time I just had enough. I was on the street, took a cigarette out of the pack, realised it was the last one of the pack and I'd have to go get some more, and I thought what and idiot I was for ever blowing my previous quit. And then something just flipped in my head and I was done. I decided there and then that I will never smoke again, this is it, I'm not doing this anymore, ever again. And I didn't buy more, I went home instead and signed up to a forum and posted on there straight away.        7 years later that was without a doubt the best moment of clarity I've ever had.
    Please, stop it with any bullshit about How To Quit.    All it has to do with is your choice.   Either, you smoke or, you don't smoke.  Personally, I don't care how you get there. The happiness comes with your choice,  TO BE FREE  and accept ,  Not One Puff EVER. 
     Addiction is the inability to stop. If i didn't watch what my mother and grandfather went through it would've been a lot tougher for me to quit. It may have been that easy for others but i was addicted and it wasn't for me. Seeing the ending motivated my quit.        
    All we have is choice.  Choose well.    I choose to not indulge my addictions.  That is all.    Choice. Possibly, I have something in my DNA that predicates my addictive behaviour.    I don't care.   I have Choice.  I Choose to be Free.    s

If they want tough love, there's a few they can goto here for that support.

We have different views with the same goal, quitting. When personal shots come in thats when its not good and no support or educating. There's different  model/views for understanding addiction. Old school will tell you just say no and stop it and think people lack willpower. Science will tell you addiction is a disease, and the research is there to support it.
    I didn't have a plan ....I just had desperation....I had more failed quits behind me ....with a plan ....than I care to count .!!!! What did it for me was just plain old fashioned fear,of having limbs amputated .....yep !!!!.....didn't like the idea of having no feet .   Joined a forum to see if anyone out there could help....well ....it did ....    What I have learnt .....you have to be a hundred percent cent in it ....to win it .......
No plan...it went like this; open the purse, fruck not enough money, buy a box of NRT gum to get me through to pay day, in the chemist on payday on the way to the bank, 6 months of NRT gum was the same price as a pack of smokes...said to meself "go orn, let's see how long this can last".... 19 months today since that last smoke, 16 months-ish since the last NRT gum.        Edit: well that ^ was the kind of blade post that really pissed me off in my early quit....I didn't just decide that was it and that was it....it was hard work, but I dug in and gave it a red hot go and chose each day not to smoke and then protected that commitment.  Oh and I did have a plan, but it came about after the fact and it was an exit plan for getting off the NRT.... That NRT exit plan was much needed for me or I would still be chewing. Edited June 28 by notsmokinjo
    I don’t think it hurts to share different experiences and methods on how people have quit. Doesn’t harm anyone and might even give someone who’s struggling to hold their quit a new idea

    So sorry I brought it up, thought it was relevant....
Don't you worry about a thing, Parsley !    It is a great topic and the cream will rise to the top in the thread.       Some people are planners and successful with their plans.   I am not a planner and have a successful quit running.  I think making the choice to quit, committing to your quit and educating yourself about addiction are essential.    To plan or to quit spontaneously makes no matter,  just a personal choice.Edited June 29 by Sazerac

I kind of had a plan.  Took 2 weeks  time off from work while the rest of the family was going to be away.  Plan was to lock myself in the house and get past the initial withdrawal without hurting any of my loved ones.  I had read up and I thought I was prepared.  Didn't work for me.  At the end of 2 weeks, I was back at work and smoking on that Mon.        Angry at myself for having lost the perfect opportunity and weeks of planning,  That was the day I found QSMB and at around lunch hour decided to try again.  No plan this time.  And it worked - the difference was the online support of folks who had  been through the same journey and could connect in ways the medical sites couldn't.       It's probably different for everyone but there is a right way for each of us.  Sometimes it takes multiple attempts to find it.  I'd say the trick is to keep trying even if there are bumps along the way.
here is an interesting vid  and text on this issue from our friend, Joel.       Conventional wisdom in smoking cessation circles says that people should make plans and preparations for some unspecified future time to quit.  Most people think that when others quit smoking that they must have put a lot of time into preparations and planning,   setting quit dates and following stringent protocols until the magic day arrives.   When it comes down to it, this kind of action plan is rarely seen in real world quitters.   I emphasize the term real world quitters as opposed to people quitting in the virtual world of the Internet.    People who seek out and participate in Internet sites do at times spend an inordinate amount of time    reading and planning about their quits before taking the plunge.    Even at our site we see people say they were reading here for weeks or months before finally quitting and joining up.   Although I suspect there are a fair number of people who had already decided to quit right away and searched us out after their quit had begun, and some people who may not have actually decided to quit but who when finding WhyQuit.com  and seeing cigarettes for what they are decided then and there to start their quits.    Getting back to real world experience though,   the best people to talk to when it comes to quitting smoking are those who have successfully quit   and have successfully stayed off for a significant period of time.  These are people who have proven that their technique in quitting was viable considering they have quit and they are still smoke free.  Talk to everyone you know who is off all nicotine for a year or longer and find out how they initially quit smoking.    You will be amazed at the consistency of the answer you get if you perform that little survey.      People are going to pretty much fall into one of three categories of stories.   They are:   People who awoke one day and were suddenly sick and tired of smoking. They tossed them that day and never looked back.  People who get sick. Not smoking sick, meaning some kind of catastrophic smoking induced illness.     Just people who get a cold or a flu and feel miserable. They feel too sick to smoke, they may feel too sick to eat.     They are down with the infection for two or three days, start to get better and then realize that they have a few days down without smoking     and decide to try to keep it going. Again, they never look back and stuck with their new commitment.  People who leave a doctors office who have been given an ultimatum. Quit smoking or drop dead–it’s your choice.   These are people for whom some sort of problem has been identified by their doctors,    who lay out in no uncertain terms that the person’s life is at risk now if they do not quit smoking.      All of these stories share one thing in common — the technique that people use to quit. They simply quit smoking one day.   The reasons they quit varied but the technique they used was basically the same.    If you examine each of the three scenarios you will also see that none of them lend themselves to long-term planning    — they are spur of the moment decisions elicited by some external circumstance.     I really do encourage all people to do this survey, talking to long- term ex-smokers in their real world,   people who they knew when they were smokers, who they knew when they quit and who they still know as ex- smokers.   The more people do this the more obvious it will become how people quit smoking and how people stay off of smoking. Again, people quit smoking by simply quitting smoking and people stay off of smoking    by simply knowing that to stay smoke free that they must Never Take Another Puff!   Joel        © Joel Spitzer 2006     The British Medical Journal reported an interesting study that tied into this article very well. Here is a link to the study:http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7539/458    I wrote a reply to the Journal that was posted on its response website. Here is a link to that reply:http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/31/setting-quit-dates    That commentary elicited a reply from another person, who was basically trying to give the impression   that serious scientists shouldn’t put too much emphasis on real world experiences.  I wrote a reply to this editorial but it somehow did not seem to get past the editorial review board at the British Medical Journal.    I think the reply is still valid so I am attaching it below:    Re: Flawed reasoning    Joel Spitzer,   Health Educator Conduct Stop Smoking Clinics for the Evanston and the Skokie Illinois Health Departments 60201,60076    Send response to journal: Re: Flawed reasoning          “…because something commonly happens in a particular way ‘in the real world’ then this should be considered the best way.   ” Smoking cessation experts often seem to have to be telling people to dismiss real world experiences.  Usually I see a little different variation of the comment above.    Common statements I have seen are something to the effects that while it is likely  that a person may at times encounter real world quitters who succeeded by using non-recommended techniques, usually meaning no pharmaceutical intervention or in what this study is showing, people who used no set quitting date,  that these people are just the exceptional cases.   What the experts are trying to do in effect is discredit observations made by people,   making them think that the occurrence of such experiences are really rare.  The author above was at least accurate enough to say,   “While it is true that most smokers who quit do so without any specific behavioral support or pharmacological treatment…”   The rest of the comment was going on to try to give the impression that there would have been even more successful quitters if people would just do what smoking cessation experts say should work as opposed to doing what actual quitters continually say has worked for them.    The tactic being employed here is to leave the impression that we could just have a whole lot more successful quitters  if people would just utilize the miraculous effective products out there that actually help people to quit. There is also the perception being portrayed that there really are very few ex-smokers out there    because most who have tried to quit have done so unaided    and everyone just knows how improbable it is for people to be able to quit in an unaided attempt.   Medical professionals and the general public are being misled to believe that quitting smoking is just too plain difficult for people to do on their own    and that the odds of a person actually quitting on their own is really pretty dismal.   This would all make perfect sense if not for the fact that we have so many successful ex-smokers in the real world. In America, we have more former smokers than current smokers.   Over half of the people who used to smoke have now quit smoking.    From the comment made above it should be clear to all that most of the people who have quit either did not know of professional recommendations for quitting or chose to ignore professional intervention techniques.   Yet these people successfully quit anyway.  I think that this is an important point to hit home with all medical professionals. The medical profession has got to start to help people to realize the real potential of success that individuals do have to quit smoking instead of perpetuating the idea that quitting is just too hard for an individual smoker to expect to actually succeed without help.   While this article should have been about planning techniques,  the original author and a few experts weighing in on the discussion have tried to turn it into a referendum on selling pharmaceutical interventions. Nicotine replacement products have been around for over two decades now–   and a significant percentage of smokers have used them to try to quit smoking.  If a product has been around for decades, used by millions of people worldwide, AND, has been truly effective, it should be easy for most health care practitioners to come up with lots and lots of successful patients, colleagues, family members and friends who have quit with these products. As I said in my original commentary above:  ” I don’t believe that there is a single professional smoking cessation “plan your quit” advocate   who will suggest other medical professionals should take a similar survey.  For if they did their study results would almost certainly be called into question when the health care professional starts seeing the results of his or her real life survey.  The experts will end up having to spend quite a bit of time trying to explain away the discrepancy, using rationalizations  like the people who planned their quit “didn’t do it right” or didn’t “plan” long enough or were “just more addicted smokers.”  In all honesty, I don’t expect my encouraging of real world observations by health care professionals   to have much impact with smoking cessation experts. They are going to profess to believe whatever other experts keep telling them to believe or, what the funders of their studies believe. I do however believe that health care workers who are on the front line and actually deal with patients who smoke are going to be a bit more critical and analytical about this.    If they spend any time talking with patients they are going to see through the rhetoric and the rationalizations of the experts.    I have always tried to disseminate the message that just because something works in the lab or in study conditions  doesn’t necessarily translate to the fact that the process will work in the real world. The smoking cessation experts seem to have to work on the basis that just because something works in the real world doesn’t mean that it is a good approach if it doesn’t seem to work in a lab.    I have high hopes that medical professionals really wanting to help their patients  are going to be more influenced by what they see is successful than by being told by the experts what should be successful, but somehow not replicable in their own practices.      Also related:“I will quit when”
     @Sazerac Now that you mention it, I remember seeing this video. Its a great video. However, in a way, it made me doubt if I plan my quit, I will be successful. But I had to plan, at least for the juice (since the juice I wanted may have not been easily available at the local store). Besides, I like to be mentally prepared when undertaking something new. Again, what works for one person may/may not work for another. So like I said, to each his/her own.

Joel gets this shit all the time. It is ridiculous. An oncologist doesn't have to have cancer in order to help a patient    just as a psychiatrist doesn't have to be a sociopath to help a sociopath or a psychopath for that matter.

But he does, since he's dealt with so many people (through his clinics or online) who have quit smoking, he has a lot of insight and experience (without being a smoker).
@Sazerac To clarify - I'm not against Joel in any way. In fact, it was his videos inspired me to go cold turkey, and I'm grateful for his videos. I did say it was a great video. Also, I do think, since he makes the videos, they will all have his own words. I didn't mean that in any negative way.

Why do we expect the people that are the best qualified to give us advice to be ex-smokers? Yeah, personal experience is second to none. But is it necessary? Just like you pointed out you don’t have to be a psychopath to become a good psychiatrist.        Maybe we should just focus on wise words as opposed to who said them.
    I didn't think you were disparaging Joel, Ankush.   You were very clear which was v. appreciated.   I was responding to the other poster.       Again, sorry for the mixup, @Ankush !   We have to stop meeting like this, lol.

@Ankush, you are SO right.  Thank you for the reminder.  I appreciate it.
@Ankush Plan or no plan, there is no one way. Whatever works , some of gave you our success and both ways. A plan works
@Whispers   lol.  nobody would ever hire me as a moderator.  funny.     I am a proponent of cold turkey only because cold turkey is my experience   and I know that you don't need a plan to quit   because I quit, almost six years ago on a whim.     Over these years I have supported ALL kinds of quits,   I believe the community will back me up on this.    How one quits, matters not. ALL quits are good quits.       Please, there is no reason for your vitriol towards me or, Joel or, anybody here.   This is a kind and supportive place where we may have different views or techniques in conquering our addiction,    but, at the end of the day, we are on the same side.        Here is MQ's post on the subject of Joel Spitzer     MarylandQuitterBy endurance we conquerAdministrators Posted January 27, 2018    Joel ASKED me if he could join up and cautioned me that his presence could cause some discord.  He then asked me how much I wanted him to post to which I told him he could post as often as he would like to.  After all, when you Google how to quit smoking (or related searches) Joel's materials are always at the top of search results so why not allow (not that he ever needed my permission) him to post here?  It would be insane not to, as his materials have helped masses of people from all over the world quit smoking.    The notion that his materials are insignificant or somehow illegitimate because he never smoked is preposterous.  The psychiatrist who successfully treats patients doesn't have the prerequisite to have had the same disorder in which he/she is treating in order to see results.  He or she only has to have empathy, experience, knowledge and most importantly, the data which shows efficacy of treatments.  Through the many clinics that Joel ran through the American Cancer Society and on his own,he gained a vast and invaluable collection of data which came directly from smokers over the course of decades. He, like the Dr. helping a person cope with the devastation caused by a divorce, losing a job, a spouse or a child does not have to have experienced the same to help the patient.  You know who spoke truth to me about my drug addiction to nicotine?  My Dr.  He never smoked a day in his life yet he knew about this addiction and what it would take for me to quit. He steered me to a place to get help which led me to Joel's materials.     Lastly, those who mentioned that his posts were spam ought to be ashamed of yourselves.  Spam is profit driven or driven for some other nefarious purpose.  Joel has never made a dime from any of his materials. His time spent here behind the scenes before he ever joined was free.  He has a desire to help people quit smoking and stay quit.  He's never asked for anything and to assume that he posts to drive people to YouTube or elsewhere is bananas.  Do you not realize that ALL of Joel's videos were posted on this site long before he ever joined??  If click bait were the case, he would have never allowed me to do this.  He encourages anybody to use his materials with the goal of helping people save their lives.  Talking about inflicting bodily harm to Joel because of efforts is very telling of where some people are at.     Should it get asked, QT is funded solely by me; always has and always will be.  Nothing on this site came to me as free as I have to retain programmers, designers, pay for licensing of the software etc.  Moreoever, QuitTrain is a Registered Trademark which was also not free, but imperative to the longevity of something that myself and few others created (the Moderators) and what was created is protected.  I allow no advertisements and don't take donations etc., even though I've been asked to.  Hell, I don't even allow Facebook logins because in case you didn't know, when sites allow this,they gain access to your friend list and can send adverts etc. to which I want NO PART OF. I share the same desire as Joel and my moderators to freely give time and money to help ANYBODY quit smoking and stay quit.  To this, you do not have the right to make false accusations regarding the motives of those who take their time and moneyto help complete strangers save their lives by quitting this deadly addiction.  Joel will not be posting here and that is his choice. However, he will still be in daily or weekly contact with me as he has for several years now.  He has lots to offer and ways to help and I am always grateful for this.               Edited July 2 by Sazerac
    I'm a former smoker who successfully quit.  I've also been a member of this forum for over three years now.  As Yogi Berra said: "You can observe a lot by just watching."      In my time here, I've developed a thesis...feels like I just might have cracked the code.       What if I told you there was one secret that every successful quitter used to set themselves free from cigarettes...        Ready for it?  This is groundbreaking stuff right here...Every quitter who has enjoyed a successful quit committed to stop putting cigarettes in their mouth and setting them on fire.      Some made a plan; some quit on an impulse.  Some went cold turkey while others used NRT and still others used Chantix/Champix.  Some read and did research; others relied on intuition.     The one unifying common thread in every successful quit comes back to the decision that was made to not put a cigarette in your mouth and light it on fire.  Everything else is supplementary to the one big decision(the aforementioned rule of not putting a cigarette in your mouth and lighting it on fire).        Quitting smoking is not judged like an Olympic diving meet, you don't get bonus points for making things more difficult.        Don't lose sight of the big picture and keep it simple.

So this isn't news, they did it in 2010.     Bhutan banned the sale of tobacco in 2010 but tightened up its law further last year to combat smuggling, requiring consumers to provide valid customs receipts for their cigarettes or chewi g tobacco, which is more common.  In March this year a monk caught carrying $2.50-worth of tobacco was jailed for three years, becoming the first person punished under the country's antismoking law.        So are these laws too draconian?        Could they work in a country with a population over 1million?       Should we all just follow suit?     A part of me wants to stand applaud them... But part of me wonders if it isn't too far.
Some may argue that all drugs should be legal (as they are in Portugal). You can't control what people want to consume and what they don't. The government should rather educate and give the power to the people to choose what they want to consume, using unbiased knowledge as a tool. Also, knowledge shouldn't be used deceptively to advance some harmful propaganda, if at all. Then again, Nicotine is one such drug, that shouldn't even exist as a drug for consumption, but that's just my opinion. So, like you, I'm divided on whether Bhutan did the right thing or not.Edited July 1 by Ankush

Here is an interesting articleFROM CRUELTY TO CARE: DRUG POLICY AND SOCIAL INCLUSION.   and another one  DRUG DECRIMINALISATION IN PORTUGAL: SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
    I am also on the fence on this one.  Could it be too far or should we be leaving the choice to the individual.  We could then use other means as education, financial, and not promoting in advertising to apply pressure.  There is individual choice but how far should government go!!!!
@Sazerac Until very recently, I was ignorant that Portugal had decriminalized drugs. My brother had brought this to my attention. My initial reaction was, then all citizens will become drug addicts. However, while this was true to a large extent during the initial years of decriminalization in Portugal, the numbers of drug abuse eventually dropped, which is shown in the article as well. Since I was a pot user for different periods in my life (2006-sometime in the beginning of 2007, sometime in 2010-sometime in 2013, sometime in 2014-July 2017), so a long time (approx 8 years), my stance for pot was that it should be legalized. However, my stance on hard drugs was that they should continue to be illegal. Maybe I was a bit partial towards pot (since I was its user), I don't know.        I gave some thought about what Portugal had done with decriminalization and eventually reached the conclusion I mentioned earlier in the thread.Edited July 1 by Ankush
    Thanks for you thoughts, @Ankush.   I believe in across the board decriminalization.    However, I would love to see Big Tobacco/Big Pharma, cartels and governments be held truly accountable for their lies.

Yes, and while there are plenty of scientific studies already on various drugs, I think further studies are required on drugs such as pot by an unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial medical body. The verdict on a drug like Nicotine is already out. Across the board decriminalization will be good. Also, environment plays a role on drug (legal or illegal) use. So, governments and all those responsible should really ask themselves, are they creating an environment where drug use is encouraged or not. There is also the fact that everybody enjoys dopamine release, and since drugs are quick way for dopamine release, I think everybody likes to get high (the extent and method used varies).
So came across this today when I fell into a Google hole. There are some very interesting points raised here... And saddly I believed many of these before educating myself ....used quite a few to justify my smoking.  https://blogs.bmj.com/tc/2016/03/23/20-myths-about-smoking-that-will-not-die/
I, along with many, believed that smoking chilled me out    and would reach for a smoke to calm me down.    It was a colossal revelation when I learned that I was only relieving the anxiety caused by low nicotine levels !Edited June 30 by Sazerac
    Yep...I 'needed' to smoke to control my anxiety....can honestly say my anxiety is better as a non smoker. Smoking just amplified my anxiety.        I had given up everything else, so it was the only thing I had left....oh and biggest myth I told myself, it was better for the kid if I kept smoking because I would be too agro trying to quit to be a good mum.       
    I won't be 'Me' without smoking was another huge myth.      Although I was enamored of my smoking persona and defiant with denial,  these were only by-products of my addiction.        When I learned the truth about addiction,  my idiocy was revealed.   
    Reading this was an eye opener on a couple of the points and I actually bought into a couple of them when I was a smoker.  I am kind of ashamed to admit that when I was younger I kind of fell into the "we all have to die of something" myth so why not smoking -- some of the stupid things that I did.  Anyway I have quit and my eyes are opened to what smoking really does -- help keeps me grounded!!!

Have to say one where Big Tobacco tried to convince countries to get their people to smoke because it was in the national interest....this was in the 90s...that's 1990s....scraping the barrels of scum there.
    I also thought I wouldn't be "me" if I quit smoking. Totally resonate with thinking I would somehow lose my identity if I stopped -  what a load of BS that turned out to be!! I was also under the majorly false impression that it relieved stress - the actual truth is it caused stress for me. I was always worrying if I have enough cigarettes/if there's somewhere I can buy some more/what if I run out/when can I have my next fix and the list goes on and on and on. I am not someone who is prone to being stressed easily and cigarettes have actually been the only bloody thing that have consistently ever stressed me out.

Want  to quit smoking? Good. That takes some nerve and that alone is enough to get it done. You don't have to be smart, you just need to use the courage and will that you have, in the right way, and get that brain of yours aligned to make it happen. Just quit. Do it now. There, you just quit. It's that easy. Now you are craving a smoke of course. It gets better, just as soon as you set your mind to being a non smoker and you free yourself from yourself, and from how you choose to live your life. This place cannot help you quit, it can't give you a quit, and it can't keep you quit. Only you can do that, and it's a choice. Either smoke. Or quit. The only thing that can happen to you here is to get encouragement and support. All that people here can do for you is to tell you how and to promise you that it can be done.You are absolutely going to have to hold yourself accountable and commit to staying quit, all on your own. This place can be effective in teaching you how to start walking after you've been crawling (quit) on your own, if you use it the right way. Understand that you are an addict first, and that's why you smoke because smoking is your answer to everything. If you are quitting you should realize that smoking is the answer to nothing.  This also includes the journey ahead of you. A cigarette will never be the answer to anything you need.

When our quits are young, we must learn and then practice in a conscious manner, to disconnect and keep separate our quits from all life events. We learn to always keep our quits sacred, protected, and never influenced by any life event that may happen. This dynamic we may call The Proper Sequence, and it is powered by your commitment to Never.Take.Another.Puff. (NTAP).It does not matter what may happen on any day in your life......as long as you maintain in a conscious manner The Proper Sequence dynamic as a primary element of your quit, you will not smoke.The Proper Sequence is:YOU --> QUIT --> LIFE.•NOT•:YOU --> LIFE --> QUIT.By maintaining this simple sequence dynamic in your quit, you will not ever have your quit influenced by life events. If you always keep your quit close to you, protecting it with your commitment to Never.Take.Another.Puff (NTAP), you will never, *EVER*, smoke again. We build our quits, and train our minds, our emotions, and our spirits to live as non-smokers in beautiful freedom by continuing to commit to NTAP. as our way of not smoking, and our way of slowly putting this awful addiction to sleep.Consciously adding The Proper Sequence dynamic to your new non-smoker identity will strengthen your quit even more.  Cristóbal (Posted on Day 364)
I love that!! So simple but profound I'm going to use that as my signature :)
This is a blue print for success. Even though you can live  his life as a new quitter and enjoy your new  freedom, you can also   be careful in places and at times where you know you may be vulnerable.  For example, taking time to see how you feel as a nonsmoker when having a drink or two before drinking a lot , or being aware of  trigger times, such as a family dinner or after a hard day. I like how Cris says we build our quits over time, which is SO true to me, growing stinger as time goes on an d new habits are made.

https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/smoking-in-restaurants-airport-may-soon-be-banned-in-atlanta/961799213             Wow, its been over 25 years that you cant smoke in restaurants and bars out here.  About time they did this
    The Atlanta City Council is late to the party on this one.  Every restaurant and bar I can think of in the A-T-L has been smoke-free for years.  Some had outdoor areas where smoking was permitted, but it's been years since any of those places had a smoking area inside the establishment.     Bars and restaurants had to make a business decision.  With smoking on a dramatic decline, going smoke-free was the right choice.
    Yea smoking in any establishment here, except the Indian casinos, has been banned for years. I thought I would hate not being able to smoke in bars when it first took effect but I was surprisingly glad they did. I never was one to smoke in restaurants so I was really happy to see that banned     
Every year i goto see the Falcons play at least 1x, i havnt seen a bar you can smoke in by that area but this news i was like Wow. They have underground bars in NY that allow it but on the DL.

They have underground bars in NY that allow it but on the DL.                The only place I have been in Atlanta that may still have a smoking section is a billiards club that has a walk-in humidor and sells cigars.  Even that joint had clearly defined smoking and non-smoking areas.        Even most of the strip clubs in Atlanta went smoke-free several years ago.  And no...it's not important how I know that.
For the sake of consistency, I'd love to see challenges to this (obviously smart and beneficial) policy by the folks on this site who love to claim that ALL limits to freedom (and the commercial tobacco industry/lobby has done a masterful job of convincing people that smoking is a form of freedom) are somehow dangerous and un-american.       Way to go Atlanta.          Christian99 17 1/2 Years Quit
    One cannot legislate addiction.     Addiction remains addiction,        Wanna talk about caffeine ? I have managed to give up all the 'eines' available.    Gives me a shit load of compassion.     I believe in information and personal choice... and have as much fun as you can in this mean old, cruel, old world. S
So (and this applies to vaping too where you see a (V)) all these are over a decade old, some over 2.....these are law...with on the spot fines...and @garry mhudson    ya see (L) they were tested in court and the laws were upheld. (Victoria, Australia)        1. (L) ... Littering with an unlit butt ...$345 2. (L) Littering with a lit butt ....$500   ** $650 on any but from a vehicle window (car)....and anyone can go to the website to do you in and there less than 1% successful challenge rate. Oh and if ya do it on a total fire ban day, triple the fine.  3. (V & L)... Smoking in a vehicle with a passenger 16 years or younger....if a passenger in the car is smoking/vaping then both the passenger and the driver get fined. If 2 passengers are smoking the driver gets a fine for each of them. Currently $350 a pop. *Don't forget it's illegal to sell vapes in Aus with nicotine, it's illegal to advertise, illegal to sell to U18, individuals can import 6weeks nicotine supplies from overseas.    4. (V) ... $500 fine for within 10m of a school fence....even on a non school day   5. (V, L) ... $500 fine within 10m of an U18 sporting event or kids park (playground)   6. (V,L) .... $250, for within 5m of the door of any public building, in an alfresco dining area/beer garden, 10m of any government buildings door (hospitals, etc), train stations, bus stops.     We might live our lives upside down....but maybe it ain't such a wrong way to be...and then again considering we are just a glorified former prison, maybe we are just not used to civil liberties       Edited June 29 by notsmokinjo
I bought 2 cigarettes too , But then i took a bath , felt fresh ,killed the dullness and threw away the 2 cigarettes too .      Somehow survived a very very dull day without smoking
    Good job sticking to your quit.  I am glad you had the power to throw them out.  Cigarettes do nothing to serve you! 
Move a Muscle, change a thought...          I have been in the same place and actually done the same(got a couple ciggs), when i didnt smoke and beat the crave the feeling of victory was so good. Going for walks was a big thing for me (move a muscle , change a thought) . The crave will pass and dealing with the situations get better and better. Good job @Sunshine59, remember this next time for some help
Great Job sunshine59, whatever you can do to get rid of the craving.  As Whispers states -- take a walk that always helps me.  I have had thoughts of getting a pack but always look at where I am at and the overall improvements, if it gets drastic I pull out the plastic cigarette I have and suck in straight air and it seems to do the trick.  You have this and doing well!!!!
Good job throwing them out sunshine, you should be super proud of yourself!  And like @Martian5 I pulled out my air cigarette when craves got too drastic and it did he trick every time
    I had a craving as well...      For a cheeseburger and fries.    Don't think I need to tell you how that ended up. 
    I'm glad you successfully fought through that, Sunshine.  I read that you got two cigarettes and I feared the worst.  I'm glad you threw them away without lighting up..        Good job.  If you ever get to this point again, though, please reach out for help here before even buying the cigarettes.  That is too close.
    Thanks for all the replies ,    That was very close , because i don't usually buy cigarettes even when i have cravings . This time i bought cigarettes , but i was able to throw it away just in time  before i lighted it up .

Hey you 2018 Excigcutioners and 2019 Ashkickers, how are you doing? You should all be so proud of yourselves Edited May 23 by jillar
    Thanks for looking out for us Jillar.       I feel I've turned a corner in the last few days. I'm feeling much happier in myself and I'm not just sitting around waiting to cross another day off the calendar.         I still think about smoking a lot but I'm finally feeling proud that I've kept going     
    I used to be a newbie. Does that count?
There was period of few days in the last couple of weeks when I didn't think of having a cigarette at all. Then that happy period went away and I find myself thinking of having a cigarette everyday again. Then I remind myself not to give into the crave. Its disappointing that my crave for a cigarette doesn't last for just 3 to 5 minutes, it lasts much longer than that. Just waiting for the day when I will stop thinking of cigarettes altogether. I don't know when that day will come though.

One of the rewards I have received from my quit is being able to jog in place for longer than 2 and half minutes. Exercising in general has also become a bit easier. I do run out of breath but I recover faster than I used to when I was a smoker. Every time I think of a cigarette, I just refuse to submit to it (even though sometimes during a crave I think "Eff it, I am going to buy a cigarette" but then I prevent myself from making that blunder) and remind myself how much more difficult exercising would be if I was a smoker.       1 hour ago, Linda Thomas said:              I am very proud to be smoke free.  I will protect my quit with every ounce of my being.  Ten months ago, this was a longing that I never thought I could achieve.           @Linda Thomas I am happy that you have achieved a 10 month quit

So, that's another way I fight the crave (besides accepting that I want a cigarette, refusing to submit to the crave; and concentrating on the rewards)...
    I would  like to say something.....I'm here at work and a thought(not a craving) came across my mind to smoke.  I didn't entertain it! I didn't fantasize about it!! I HAD to dismiss it immediately!!!! Not allowing that thought to take root!!! Try it @Ankush I know I'm a newbie but we are here to encourage and support each other.  My quote is I do WHATEVER, HOWEVER, WHENEVER, TO NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF
    You have the correct outlook Ankush.  Focus on the good things you are seeing and have yet to see. That will help get you through. It's early days still Ankush. It just takes time so be patient. The magic will happen.

Try it @Ankush I know I'm a newbie but we are here to encourage and support each other.  My quote is I do WHATEVER, HOWEVER, WHENEVER, TO NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF        @QueenB As far as I am concerned, I was under the impression that a thought and a crave are one and the same. Its nice to know that you are able to dismiss the thought/crave for a cigarette so quickly. Yes, the self commitment to never take another puff is going good so far. Its good to know you're doing well with your quit. Keep on marching forward with your quit!!!Edited May 23 by Ankush

It's early days still Ankush. It just takes time so be patient. The magic will happen.       @reciprocity OK, thank you. It also seems like forever since I quit smoking, but I realize its just no man's land (since its been more than a month since I quit). I did read the post about no man's land some days ago...
@Ankush, those constant thoughts of cigarettes on a daily basis was the worst part of the early quit for me and probably many others but just wait until the day comes, and it will, that you wake up feeling great and halfway through your day you realize you haven't thought about it one time. It's such a great feeling and it will come for you too, I promise 
    Let's see.... I can have a thought about a smoke, but it remains just that, a thought.  A craving to me is every fiber of my being is involved. I want to smoke it, hold it, watch the smoke drift in the air. smell it (ALL OF IT AND SOME )
    Be encourage @Ankush it isn't always easy for me.  I have to FIGHT to keep this.

Hey Newbies! There's a Pinned Thread on the Quit Smoking Discussion Page called The 1 Year Commitment. There's a reason for that pledge. There are seasonal challenges that we face depending on the climate we live in or even our religious beliefs and celebrations. We were conditioned to smoking when certain things happened with celebrations or changing of seasons. You must face these times now as a non smoker to become comfortable with no longer smoking in those situations.   It's not because you will be having major cravings all the time. That tends to settle down within the first 4-7 months depending on the person. You WILL come to a point when you just suddenly realize that you never want to smoke again. That is a magical moment. It happens to all who adhere to the NOPE pledge for long enough. This doesn't mean you will never think about smoking again. It just means you will have a different reaction to those thoughts when they occur. That's when you KNOW you've arrived at your forever quit!Edited May 24 by reciprocity

As soon as a problem came along I would throw a big hissy fit and head outside to chain smoke. When that guy pissed me off at work I came here and talked about it on my thread and when I got upset about NRT I wrote an SOS.  I talked and people here helped me and I got past it. I actually dealt with my feelings rather than smoke.       Don't get too excited guys. Not smoking won't change me from being an over opinionated, volatile, self righteous dick lol.

    Check in time! How's everyone doing? 
You guys are stuck with me.  I am still here.
    Sticking to my quit
Yep, I am a dumb ass. I gave in. I never posted in SOS because I am not good at asking for help until the shit has actually hit the fan.        Maybe it was because of a particularly long week at work. Maybe it was the weather. Some new neighbors moved in who happen to pretty much live on the front porch. I hate people, so that means hoping to not be bothered when I have to do yard work in the front. I am sure I could come up with a good excuse.       Anyways Tuesday the 23rd, I had been having some serious craves for a week straight. Nothing real big triggered it, just came out of nowhere. So I bought a pack of my favorite smokes and have smoked three of them, one a day. A few puffs here and there, like my final days of smoking before my last quit. It helps that I do not carry my cigarettes when out and about or at work.   What was I thinking? - "OK, why am I depriving myself of something I enjoyed?"      My craves over the last week before Tuesday were roughly as bad as the first three days of quitting.    So, how can craves return full force after several months or over a year? Yeah I had craves as bad before but it was still when I was pumped about quitting.        After smoking again, I felt relaxed but really stupid, maybe the same feeling as if you lost your temper for a second and smashed one of your car windows just out of anger. Then you think, "Well, that was dumb, I broke it, couldn't control it..."      I guess the answer is to throw away the pack and "just not smoke". Apparently it is not that easy. Hell no it ain't.    I need and want to stay quit for me. I do not want to end up like some of the stories I have read here where it takes some horrible medical problem before I quit. I want to do this while I am ahead.  I do not care so much what "society" thinks of my smoking. I want to lay off for ME.        I though by now, I had this. Like craves were a thing of the past. But I guess not. When the hell then do they vanish? Two years? Ten? Never? At least now I understand how someone can quit for years and then go back.        So, when I do put them back down, does that mean another "hell week"? What should I expect?Edited April 26 by Jet Black
I will be honest, it is hard to see this.  Yep I am going to say get rid of what you have now, do not take another puff (that will help stop, hopefully going thru another hell week if you are being honest about what you have smoked).  We all make mistakes but it is what we learn from them that is important, take a deep look at the last couple of weeks to see if you can find the trigger.  If I am being honest yes I still get a strong craving especially that last month or so do to family and some medical stress and really fought to stay away from smoking.  Quitting can a never ending process -- time just gives us many more ways of coping with the craves and realizing we do not need to smoke -- that life is better on the other end.  What can you expect -- More of My Support as you move forward without smoking.  You do not want to be like me and others where quitting became a medically important for my health -- you can do this!!!!!      And remember the SOS board is there for all of us!!!!Edited April 26 by Martian5
    Oh, Jet Black, I am so very sorry to read this.  Regarding craves, how long do they last?  I don't really know the answer to that question and actually don't even think craves had anything to do with my relapse last year.  I'm still trying to figure it out; I guess it was complacency?  But I'm going to say that, as addicts, we can probably have craves after any length of time.  It's just that as time passes, the craves should become fewer and more easily managed.     Where do you go from here?  The sooner you quit again, the easier it will be.  If you quit now, I doubt that you will have a "hell week" per se but you will likely feel the pull of nicotine that was reintroduced into your system.  We're all so different, it's hard to say.  Just don't let it go months and months like I did.  Then it is basically quitting from scratch again.     Best wishes to you that you fix this mistake as soon as possible!
    ^^^^^^ Yes I believe Mona hit one aspect and that is complacency -- we will always have to be on guard since craves can and do come out of nowhere!!!!

@Jet Black ,        Once you are a smoker , that tendency to smoke may remain for the rest of the lives .   This is what i have learned from my past experiences .  Only the intensity of the craving keeps changing .      There are times when you have no cravings at all    Sometimes you have a strong craving , You have to somehow fight it off  Sometimes you have a very light craving , You still have to fight it off .      You should have tried everything else other than smoking .           Edited April 27 by Redemption3

    So Now What ??  A good question ...only you can answer .... You can carry on smoking and risk your health every day ...trying to dodge that bullet ..or ... You can just throw the cancer sticks away ...sit back down in your chair and start again .....your choice....   The SOS thread is there for a good reason ...we carnt help if you don't give us a chance ...    I could have got the frying pan out ..  I'm disappointed for you ...     
    Shit JB, sorry to hear that.        Give yourself a firm kick in the butt and get back on track. You had one of the best reasons for quitting Ive read here so far: you want to be able to laugh without choking (and something with 'retard' but I dont know the exact context when you said that so nevermind).       Oh and, please let me know when you "decide" to become a smoker again, ill send you one of these awfull Nickelback cigaret boxes!       Hey, this is not what you want. Quit it.
Well JB, I would get right back on the train.  Throwing away a 1-1/2 year quit is disappointing.  Those cigarettes may taste good and feel good to smoke but you know that is just the junkie thinking part.  Concentrate on the reason you quit.   I am glad you posted and hope we can, once again,  help guide you to freedom.
    Jet I am so new here but am so sorry about you losing your quit. All I can tell you is to just commit to not smoking anymore. I am however, greatful that you are here posting your experience. I learn from them. I am cheering you on. We can beat this. 
Now what?  You have a decision to make.     Do you really want to be a smoker again?        Is the occasional hit of nicotine worth the cost and sacrifice?     Only you can answer these questions for yourself.           On 4/26/2019 at 6:03 PM, Jet Black said:                I guess the answer is to throw away the pack and "just not smoke". Apparently it is not that easy. Hell no it ain't.                "Easy" is a relative term.      However, just not smoking is the cardinal rule of quitting.  It's a simple principle.  It's also the only principle that really matters in a quit.
    Over three days, I smoked six of the cancer sticks. Each time, Something interesting happened - head rush, guilt, feeling sick, having horrid taste in mouth, being able to smell myself, thinking about how smoking is a fire hazard...        So last night I gave the rest of the pack to my room mate and said, "crumble these". She has never experienced tobacco nor nicotine so nit like she would pick up the habit.    I just decided that smoking wasn't worth the BS.        The worst part is feeling guilty. I seldom feel guilt but damn, that was horrid.        So if anyone else sees this and is thinking, "screw it, I want to smoke". It really is not worth it. It is kind of the same guilt you might feel if you got mad an broke something expensive.

Learn by this mistake ,and remember it .....
    I guess it was Friday night/Saturday morning when I had my room mate destroy the remains of the pack.   Weird but I haven't really wanted one since. Feeling my lungs burn when I smoked the last one kind of put a stop to THAT desire.        One thing, I had someone on this board I had become good friends with (even if but e-mail pals) but she kept relapsing and ran into some kind of pretty serious health issues.  Maybe the damage was already done, maybe if she had kept the quit, the problem would have lay dormant. It wasn't even lung related but supposedly was connected to smoking.     I forgot to add earlier - when I was in the process of a relapse/slip/whatever, it was like some disgusting, dreadful chore to step out and smoke.   
    Good I am glad you got rid of the rest of the pack and are back on track -- Now keep it that way.  At least you see that it was not all that great to have those few and good that you had a negative outcome (throat/lungs burning) -- maybe that will keep you going.  Welcome back aboard!!!!
    Aw, JB, I'm sad to read this. But I get it. You wanna talk about relapse...read my profile. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt, lit it on fire and smoked it. But that was then. This is now. I have to get on the Quit Train and STAY on. For good. Because I, too, know about serious health issues. Mine are not caused by smoking but rather an autoimmune disease, but my lungs are affected. My body is building up scar tissue in my lungs for no reason at all. And, if I want to live, I need to breathe ONLY clean air for the rest of my life. I can do that. Because I do want to live.     So I'm taking the whole relapse option off the table. It's gone. Will I face cravings? Yes. I'm sure of it. Will I give in? Hell no. What will I do instead? Whatever it takes.     Whatever it takes. That's what we have to do.       I'm glad you're back on the Train. You and your sense of humor have gotten me through some dark days. I would be extremely sad if you weren't here!
    A mistake is only a total waste when we don't learn anything from it.       The addicted mind tries its best to convince us that smoking is a satisfying experience that will calm and soothe.  The reality is: smoking sucks.      Commit this experience to memory and drive on.

I thought pretty much everyone here but Doreen hated me.       Now as far as doing something besides smoking, I can recommend a few other habits (some bad) -      Spending too much time on ebay, staying up all night and sleeping away the day (I work an evening shift), collecting LP's (hipsters are not the only ones who do that), cursing loudly at work when frustrated, eating way too much sugar, hitting the thrift stores to buy more BS one doesn't need, and most important - being a reason forums have moderators.       There is something else I should mention - One of my co-workers is a chewer. Probably since he was a kid. Anyways, he had been quit for 3 1/2 years. I told him I had smoked, and he mentioned he picked up chewing again, like back in November. I said, "I need to stop, I do not want this habit". Then he said something horrifying! He said, "It is like the love of my life. I know it is bad for me, cancerous etc but I cannot quit, like I am married to the habit". Man, I have NO desire to be married again. Especially not to the nico-demon.

1 and a half years of quit and breaking it can be a bit depressing      I am in my 5th month without smoking .      I still get very bored , tired and dull after 7 o clock in the evening ,because i spent a lot of time in the morning studying and preparing my final semester project       Anyway please think positive and start new .You have only smoked a little after 1 and half years without smoking .              Choose to be optimistic, it feels better    Happiness is not something ready made.

Here is a vid from our friend, Joel Spitzer, that helped me understand addiction.    Edited April 13, 2018 by Sazerac
    A reminder to all of us....
    Bump !!
    bump
Our Nancy asked me to post this from my blog to 'Quit Smoking Discussion'.  Thank you Nancy.     Lifetime of Addiction       I didn't want to hear this but, I am now facing this truth.    Nicotine Addiction doesn't go away.You can put it to sleep. You can even put it into deep deep and deeper sleep for years ! but, it will awaken the moment you take one puff.One Puff.This is for your whole life.  Mind boggling, huh !?    This was the choice you likely didn't even know you were making    all those years ago when you started smoking,   I didn't understand the ramifications for sure. But, it is the truth.You will always need to be cognizant of your addiction even when smoking is a vague memory,    because the moment you take a puff, the moment you take One Bloomin' PUFF,  That's it ! It's all over and your enslavement will begin, again.    What tenacity !    but, you need to understand,    Nicotine is not as tenacious as You and Your Will.You can quit. I know you can. I quit and I am not a special snowflake,    I am a Nicotine Addict, just like you.   I have great resentment about my Nicotine Addiction.   Damn....I didn't know it would be so invasive.  I didn't know it was going to be a lifetime relationship.I am so angry about thisand it is My Own Damn Fault !  But, my anger, it is a good anger.  It is a righteous anger.    It is an anger that will fuel my commitment to NOPE.    Not One Puff EVER.   Copping to the 'forever' part is a cold hard reality of the addiction. At some point, I had to quit fooling myself and accept it.  It isn't just for today.    It must be forever. If it isn't...I will continue to enslave myself.     Some feel their addiction is so strong they cannot quit,This is wrong. You have the power. You always have the power to quit and you always have the power to stay quit.    Make the commitment to NOPE !   As our friend, Sarge, says, 'Easy Peasy'.  Easy ! not complicated !

I have great resentment about my Nicotine Addiction.Damn....I didn't know it would be so invasive.I didn't know it was going to be a lifetime relationship.I am so angry about thisand it is My Own Damn Fault !  Yes, what you said there. Others tried to warn me, I have no idea still why I didn't hear or believe them!! Beautiful piece of writing Sally. xx
Phew....great writing.....I am so sad,I spent 52 years of my life...addicted.to those dam things....And I'm only too happy ,that I'm still around to write this....
I have great resentment about my Nicotine Addiction.Damn....I didn't know it would be so invasive So resentful here too. No one warned me. When my friends and I started smoking there were no "warning" labels.But would it have made a difference if there were warnings then? Probably not, because I picked up the cigs and became a nicotine addict some years later - despite the surgeon generals "warning". If I'm to be resentful now, it should be aimed toward big tobacco and all the LIES! Like Doreen, I'm grateful to be alive to write this. 
I feel the same way.  :)
I have great resentment about cigarette companies.  Fat cat B******d's.  One in 2 smokers die from smoking related illness.  Many people suffer from smoking related disability.

  "But, nobody put a gun to my head to keep me smoking.  I have to take full responsibility." Yeap!!!

    Awesome...
Thanks for the bump.        Do I resent nicotine addiction. Yes. I do resent that it is legal and many people profited from my addiction (knowingly profited). I have an illness now and think that smoking has done some damage to my body.        I read somewhere that nicotine addiction is like giving a kid a loaded gun at 13 that goes off in their 50's. This statement was said many years before I even started to smoke. They knew what they were doing the tobacco companies and they should have been stopped. Drug dealers, murderers with blood on their hands.
    I don't resent it. I have nothing and nobody to blame but myself. It was known and obvious that cigarettes were harmful when I started and I did it anyway, and I continued in spite of disadvantages, lack of energy and becoming more and more of a social outcast. I've left it behind and I'm trying to turn my life around now. What good will hating myself bring? What good will punishing myself for that one bad decision bring? I put a closure and keep on living, the best I can.

I do consider starting smoking my mistake and I take full responsibility for it, self hatred and constant regret will not magically turn back time but will only make me feel worse.

Arsenic was a leading cause of death at one point and now it isn't. I do think most smokers would tire of going to the drug dealer for their cigarettes. They would tire of hiding it from the cops etc. They would be more concerned about what harmful might be in the tobacco (unregulated) etc. This argument is a little tired. I've heard it before and it never made sense. It seems similar to other arguments I hear that are inflexible and circular.

I've heard it before and it never made sense. It seems similar to other arguments I hear that are inflexible and circular.            People continue on smoking in spite of constant price increases. There are people who buy cigarettes instead of food. There are people who search for butts in public garbage bins. They would go to their dealer no matter what and if their stash is clean or not would be the last thing on their mind. Same as now, when junkies crave drugs they get it, clean or dirty. Yes, some smokers would stop, same as nowadays some quit when cigarettes become more expensive. There’s always a margin.      I believe we are disagreeing because you’re talking pure theory. Let’s assume cigarettes become illegal. There are going to be millions people craving and in that state they’ll be unpredictable. Did you consider the riots and deaths? The money coming to the state budget, no schools, roads, hospitals. When I hear arguments like yours I can’t help but think about panels when people discuss how war is bad, conclude it’s bad and go home happy with how engaged they are. Time and energy spent on that could have been spend on prevention or something that does work.        Tobacco companies do sell harmful products. I don’t deny it and nobody denies it. Because of usage of that product many people lost their lives. However, they don’t lie. Information about illnesses caused by smoking, pictures of black lungs and warnings in forms of obituaries take more space on packages than the brand logo. They give us all on display and still people start and continue smoking. We did start and continue smoking. The first cigarette and the thousands afterwards were our decision, we knew what was it leading to.

@Giveintowin I understand you've chosen a nice soapbox from which to preach your message.  You have to understand that not everyone agrees with you, and not get personally offended when we don't.     I very much agree with @sgt.barney in saying that it is the personal choice of every smoker to smoke, and their consequences to pay as a result of that choice.  The government (wherever you're from) should not intervene in telling the people what they should/should not do (while most governments think this is their cause for existence).
Early in my quit..I blamed the tobacco companies for all the illnesses smoking had brought to me and my hubby,who suffers from end stage emphysema...   I too thought ,how can they be allowed to kill all these folks....I thought the sarge was a crazy bloke..but....    Over 4 years down the line...learning all what i have about addiction and choices..hubby and myself did have a choice... And we did ignore the warnings...  Sarge is just bluntely speaking the truth....I still hate the companies.... That hasn't changed...I just stopped blaming others for my mistakes...  This just my opinion...

Spirit Airlines passenger banned for life after allegedly vaping on flight http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/AACAOg8?ocid=se    This struck me funny.  What people do because of their addiction.  I can't tell you how many times I thought I could sneak into a bathroom and have a cigarette and nobody would notice.    Exhaling into a paper bag.  How silly, everyone know a plastic one would have been better.Edited June 9 by Linda Thomas
    What a dummy lol. I'm surprised that the smoke alarm went off in the bathroom since its vapor! 
    Anything to get their fix, there's a show a A&E about jail and they blow the smoke in the toilet and flush.
    I'm not proud of this, but I would chew some of that nicotine gum when I had to fly.        Still remember being in that awful smoker's lounge in the airport (you remember...the place with the stained gray walls that smelled like the Devil's asshole) chainsmoking and popping pieces of Nicorette before boarding the plane.      Being an addict is no way to live.
    I was as addicted as anyone, but never even considered smoking in an airplane bathroom. I mean, they make it pretty clear that it's not allowed, so that's that. At least for me. I'd either chew nicotine gum or just deal with the cravings.      You can be damn sure the first thing I did was go out and smoke the minute I got off that plane though.      
And then there's this...        Man jailed for nine years and six months for smoking in plane toilet     https://metro.co.uk/2017/05/25/man-jailed-for-nine-years-and-six-months-for-smoking-in-plane-toilet-6663266/

I thought it was just a fine for smoking on a plane. Then I read through and found that it started a fire and put everybody on the plane in danger      On most flights I would just deal with cravings and light up as soon as I could after getting off.  On long 6+ hr flights I would use gumEdited June 12 by Wayne045

    What do prisoners do with baby diapers?!
    I dont think I want to know the answer,?
Well girl prisoners with babies under 2 would be putting them on there sprigs one would think.      When the no smoking laws first came in there were riots. They get patches and gum and stuff.

    That's sad 
    Shit happens man 
    Its very sad but addicts will do anything to get their fix, smoke on a plane in the bathroom use baby diapers i'll give you another. AT my mothers wake it was in between the day and night viewing, i got there early for some alone time and i saw a homeless person in the big ashtray outside taking all the half smoked ciggs. I asked the people working and they said they always do it.
    Yea they do that at the bowling alley here. I found out the hard way when I still bowled and smoked. I never had time to smoke a whole one so I would run out, smoke about half and save it until I had another chance to sneak out. But every time I came out the other half was gone...   Fun fact: the name of our bowling team was The Smoking Bowlers lol. And we won the league that year 
In a couple of days I will be 3 months quit. I am doing my celebration thread now as I am not sure when I will be visiting the forum again as I am moving home.         So I'm clinking my glass and making a little speech.        Firstly I just want to thank ALL of you for supporting me through this quit. I do however want to give enormous thanks to the people who have been with me from the start of this journey. Those of you who found the patience to keep willing me on through so many failed attempts.       Secondly I am pleased to say that I am smoke free and now nicotine free         Until next time - Love you all xxxxxx
    Well done Lilly!        And I hope the move goes smoothly 
    Congratulations Lilly!!! This is good news
    Congratulations Lilly and best of luck with your move!
    Great stuff - well done 
    Congratulations Lilly, I'm really happy for you. Good luck with your move and please don't be a stranger, we still want to see those charms      
    Congratulations Lilly. Taking the additional leap to becoming nicotine free is the crowning achievement to a healthier life of freedom. Great job!
    Congrats, Lilly! Celebrate your achievements which were so hard-fought for by you...and KTQ going as you move back home!     
    Congratulations on your three months, Lilly!    Remember, you are still in the early days and you have a year of triggers to get through. Stay within shouting distance of QTrain and protect your quit WITH YOUR LIFE !    I am so happy for you, enjoy your move and your nicotine free life. S
    Congrats lilly on three months free! Bravo 
Fantastic job on the 3 month mark -- hopefully you find some time to celebrate amongst all the moving!!!!

    Congratulations Lilly!

    Yay! I had an employee years ago who would throw her cigarettes out the window, sometimes ending up in the back window of my car even after telling her many many times not to do that. So finally I told her that if she threw another cigarette out of the window and it caused a fire I was turning her in. After that she FINALLY started using the ashtray!
    They could fly back in and burn the seats and in dry season (happens in PA) could start a fire.
    Yes, they did fly back in many a time 
I had an uncle that smoked and he threw a lit cig out the window as he was driving down the street he lived on (my family lived 2 doors down). It flew into the back seat of the car and smoldered for awhile, I guess....then it burst into flames in the middle of the night! Neighbor called fire department. According to neighbor, the FD said they got there just in time before car blew up! Down at my house, we were all fast asleep and were shocked to see the big mess and the burnt hulk of his car sitting in driveway...and the stench  of it all!
This will all of been covered a 100 times + but I've got a couple of questions for anyone that wouldn't mind spending a couple of mins answering [hi btw]       Been smoking free for about a month ish - I haven't been counting on purpose as it doesn't matter to me how long just staying stopped if you see what I mean? Every time I start counting in the past I've always started again BUT I keep getting bloated and keep breaking wind, mostly at night/early morning and I'm 'hoping' this isn't a permanent thing? If I drink alcohol I absolutely STINK?      I've also lost my voice and sound like Micky Mouse although I went to Docs and he says this is more likely a bug and he's given me anti biotics.        I've been walking, 'trying' to eat healthy etc etc and 'trying' to get blood circulation going again as I can get 'dead feet' while driving - I've been getting depressed also angry too sometimes, well a bit short tempered, the only good thing so far is food - I absolutely love my food atm BUT as I'm trying to be more healthy I can't eat much of it which is annoying too :)   If anyone has any wise words especially about the night time bloating and the flatulence it really would be appreciated, anything really as I feel a bit down and depressed and all that sort of self pity shitty stuff - anyway nice to say hi to anyone out there and much respect
    Welcome FunkyFunJo and congrats on taking back your life  Everything you're dealing with is totally normal and will subside with time. I used my gassy days as payback to a really gassy husband of mine lol. We had the funniest thread on another board about gas that I so wish was here now so you could see just how common it is.The anger and depression are normal too and will also get better with time. If it gets too bad though I'm sure you could speak to your dr about it and maybe get a temporary med to help you past it.As far as eating healthy, that's always good but in the early days of your quit you may find you're craving more sweets and junk food. Go ahead and listen to your body. It knows what it needs to help mend the damage done by smoking.
    Hello Funkyfunjo, glad to have you aboard for this journey.  It is fantastic that you are a month or so in and I get where you are coming from on the exact counting.  As to your questions I did have some bloating in the earlier stages but did not bother me much.  The voice thing not so sure, did/ do have a bit of problem but at this time counting that to allergies, anyway your throat will benefit from quitting -- keep your doctor appraised if it gets worse or you get more concerned  (after I quit because of some throat issues they did do a CAT scan and all came out great).  The blood circulation and the "feet problem" I did have -- what I can say now is that my feet are much better and circulation overall is much better -- this is a continual process as your quit gets longer, you will see many improvements.  There is a lot to read here that will help.  Again great having you along!!!!!!
    I sure found that my sense of smell improved after I quit. Could it possibly be you didn't quite realise how bad your farts smell before?!! Lol I remember coming out the gym all sweaty and thinking ooft a bit whiffy and I'd never thought that as a smoker! 
Thank you for answering, I feel a bit down at the moment and found this site and just thought I'd give it a go, I lost my missus to lung cancer but it didn't stop me, in fact I went worse and ended up smoking 40 a day - spent the last couple of years sad, pathetic and lonely BUT I'm doing my best to rectify the situation.     As for my 'wind problems' I 'think' I only smell really bad after drinking a Beer or 2, it doesn't take much but for some reason alcohol makes my wind issues quite smelly [too much information?]      I am worried about bloating though, I'm staying away from food that has a reputation for these things [like beans] but every evening my belly stretches out and every morning I keep breaking wind until it flattens again, I hope it goes away but it's been a few weeks ish usually though I don't smell bad, I just seem to fill up with 'wind'      a big thank you for answering , I hope you guys are all doing good, it's nice to get some answers and thank you very much for taking the time, I feel a bit rubbish tonight for some reason, up to now I've done OK, just a downer moment sorry if I sound weak, I WILL win this time though as I think at last I want it enough.       you take it easy and thanks again, just something coming back at me helps

Welcome FunkyfunJo and great job on two months smoke free.  This is a great place to ask those questions.  We all have been through the variety of different issues that goes with quitting.    No matter what, quitting is the best thing you can do.  It will give you so much more power and self esteem.    Read as much as you can on the board and post often.  We want to be there to help you on your quit journey.  There is a lot of fun, humor and support here.     There is the daily Nope pledge, which I love doing every day.

That is what we are here for.  Do not go it alone.  There is so much more strength together.    If you continue to be bloated, you might check with your physician.  I do remember going through a period like that.    Depression comes with quitting because you are saying goodbye to something that you thought comforted you.  It was your friend, but in hindsight, it really was you enemy.  I am sure you are also grieving the loss of your partner.   Post as often as you like.  There is always someone around to make you laugh or lift you up.  We want you to have success.
Thanks a lot, when it comes to success I think it's sticking this time and as it stands there's NO WAY I will be smoking again, the 'bloating' I have to admit has been a bit of an annoyance and I'm glad it's not just me, not that I'd wish these things on anyone else   Smoking has been a major factor when it comes to bad things in my life so you would of 'thought' I'd of give it up ages ago but it's one of those mysteries of life the fact that I haven't but this time I am super determined and to be honest I'm glad I have stumbled upon this forum and I plan to keep dropping as you sound like nice folk.  Noticed Linda your 2 dogs in pic, what breed are they? are they yours or just a pic? after my other half passed away I got a border collie who is now my only and best friend, he's a good lad      Thank you everyone for your input, you keep smiling while I keep breaking wind  [hope it's not forever] it's been nice to meet you.

He sneaks up on me though when I least expect it.     Got up to take the dog for a good walk but it's bucketing down today so he'll have to wait, still bloated, still flatulating [is that a word] but at least I've been able to moan about it somewhere, it's appreciated.     For a treat I'm off out today for a bit of retail therapy - time to buy some new clothes - thanks again
    Welcome aboard @FUNKYFUNJO Its probably a good idea to lay off alcohol for at least the first couple of weeks. It may be the reason behind your stomach problems. As Linda mentioned, if these physical problems persist even after a few weeks, get yourself checked thoroughly by a doctor. The stomach does take some time (the amount of time will vary from person to person) to adjust to not smoking. You could be experiencing some acidity issues, but don't take my word for it, go to a doctor who treats gastrointestinal problems. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetable salads along with fresh fruit juice. For more information, go through some of Joel's videos about the early days of a quit. All the best!!!
    Welcome aboard, @FUNKYFUNJO and congratulations on being smoke free for a month-ish.        I can't add much that hasn't already been said.  I do think the gas issues are common with many quitters but they do seem to go away with time, along with other short-term side effects to quitting (like brain-fog, etc).  The long term benefits to quitting are definitely worth the short-term issues.     It is good to have you here.  Stick around, there is a lot of knowledge and support you can get here to help you stay smoke-free for good.
Thanks everyone for your input - I have had a sore throat too and my voice nearly completely went, I sounded like Mickey Mouse so I went to the Doc who said it was nothing to do with quitting, said it was a 'bug' and gave me some antibiotics which seem to be working - the bloating issues continue though, I mentioned that to the Doc too who said to eat plenty of Wholemeal bread and drink loads of Water, pretty much what you guys said     The best thing for me, up to now, is my Asthma has 90% cleared up, it's mainly a self inflicted thing, smoking is so very bad for you in so many ways, I doubt very much I'll start again, for me though it comes along when you least expect, I seem to suddenly get 'down' and my reaction has always been a 'take it out on yourself' kind of thing so I have smoked and smoked some more, I need to be ready, know the signs and be ready - it's like my brains way of getting me to smoke again    Anyway atm I'm feeling OK, todays treat is I'm going to throw caution to the wind and EAT, forget about the bloating for now as the anti bloating diet hasn't done much and I'm loving FOOD, I am not one to put weight on so why not eh        Thanks a lot
    FunkyfunJo, glad you saw your physician and you have found that most of your issues were not quitting smoking related.  You have a good quit going so don't let those smoking thoughts  take over.  That is the addiction talking to you.  Smoking does nothing but ruin the quality of your life.  When you think you are going to give in to those thoughts, post an SOS.  We are here to help you.   I promise things will get better.  Once you rid yourself of this addiction, you gain so much power and self esteem.
Cheers Linda - I do have one question - sounds a bit daft - googled it and haven't found much saying it's a big nono - in 2 minds to even ask really but here goes haha ......      Can you have too many baths ????  I used to take showers all the time but have found taking a bath every evening helps me relax and sleep, I don't have them super hot or anything but I put some smelly aroma stuff in, put on some relaxing music from YouTube and it helps me 'chill out'        I have been doing this every evening for the last couple of weeks, what you think?
    Well I don't know about Linda but I think it sounds very relaxing so go for it  
    Exercise and deep breathing got me through those moments when I felt irritable or let myself get all wound-up during the early days of the quit.  I don't even remember the last time I wanted a cigarette but still use the deep breathing exercises I learned when I quit daily.  Taking a little pause for the cause and breathing intentionally is just a good way to get yourself centered again.      I don't want to make light of the flatulence situation, but I'm not really sure how much worse my farts were when I quit.  Our sense of smell is improving at the same time our digestive system is adjusting.  Not sure if the farts are worse or if they're just magnified by our improved ability to smell things.

Not sure why you think having a daily bath is a problem? Is there something I don't know lol.        I bought really expensive bath products and body lotions like Estée Lauder, gucci etc when I quit. I smelt so good that I wouldn't have wanted to cover that smell with smoke.      I also bought strong washing liquid and softener for my clothes.  Smelling nice was a big part of why I never lit up.        Edited June 10 by Lilly
    Thanks Lilly - that makes me feel a bit better as you hear things like too many baths take the 'oils' out of your skin and being too clean lowers your immune system, also too many baths are supposed to lower a blokes sperm count, not that I think I will be having any more kids anyway     At the moment all this exercise I've started doing leaves me aching, especially my legs and a good soak with a bit of relaxing music and as you say a bit of 'aromatherapy' going on does help, not only my aches and pains but it also helps me relax and get some sleep.  
I love a hot soak in the tub.  I hate showers.  My husband always used to tease me and said it was like soaking in ones dirt.  Now that he is older,  I find him taking many a soak, in the evening to help those sore muscles.     FunkyfunJo, that sounds like a great way to relax from the stresses of quitting.  Wish I had thought of it.  You are doing great.   Wasn't it Tony Randall (the actor) that had a child in his 80's.  A man is never too young to reporduce.

    Actually Boo this is on point.  Well balanced and don't constantly worry -- keep it all in perspective and listen to your body -- then enjoy!!!!

By Associated Press Published Jun 5, 2019 at 5:01 AM | Updated 45 minutes ago   NEWSLETTERS Receive the latest national-international updates in your inbox Email   Privacy policy | More Newsletters   Mario Tama/Getty Images, File   Cigarette packs are on display for sale in a shop April 1, 2009 in New York City.   Beverly Hills has become the first U.S. city to end most tobacco sales. The City Council on Tuesday unanimously voted to snuff out sales of cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products beginning in 2021.  Take a Look Inside 'Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge' at Disneyland The ban covers sales at gas stations and pharmacies as well as convenience and grocery stores. However, it exempts hotels and three plush cigar lounges in the wealthy and glamorous Los Angeles suburb.    The hotel exemption was designed to accommodate tourists, who could have a concierge deliver their smokes — although they'd have to smoke them outside. Gas station owners opposed the measure, saying it unfairly targeted their businesses and might force employee layoffs. Retailers said the ban might shift sales to neighboring communities. The National Association of Tobacco Outlets opposed the measure. The group claims tobacco sellers in the wealthy community might see monthly income fall 25 precent to 45 percent, CNBC reported.
    Wow.  It would be amazing if this could happen.  
    Hopefully the beginning of things to come --- this would be great!!!
    Some will say give the people their choice (and thats their right) but its good to ban it. It will create a black market for those who want it but so much bad from tobacco

    I rather see them increase the cost to some ridiculous amount of money than ban them. Black markets are never good, no matter what the product or service...…….
They'll pay it, they put the cigarette cards in baseball packs years back to attract the kids. I wasnt one that started early with ciggs, i started at 26 but most smoked early. I did smoke pot at 14 but ciggs years later
    This should get the dumbest idea award.     Unless they actually ban smoking then what exactly have they achieved. Smokers will just stock up or drive to get a pack.       It will never stop kids smoking!
Yesterday my husb wanted Chinese food, and while going to get it, I sure got to thinking (no, not about the food… lol) This restaurant is on the opposite end of town from where we live now… when I quit smoking, we lived in that old neighborhood… well, they have the best Chinese food there, so I decided to take the drive yesterday. This is what struck me:  I drove by THE Plaid Pantry and felt the past 5 years kinda slip away for a moment… I remembered my huge struggle and fight within myself one day at that place.  I was around 2 months quit at the time and I really thought I wanted to smoke… so I got in the car and headed to the Plaid Pantry… when I got there, I sat in the parking lot a few minutes, fighting this crave… I then pulled out of the parking lot and spent the next hour literally driving around the block and not being able to decide if I really should buy smokes or not… I’m glad a cop didn’t see me, they would have thought I was casing out the joint! lol Anyway, I finally left and went home, no smokes bought.  That was one of the biggest days of my quit because I walked away from those ugly smokes.  When we do this, we become stronger in our quits… for me, the first 3 months were the worst, yet each day became a little easier... and each time we say NO, we win a little bit more of freedom, and before you know it, freedom is total and it's awesome! So if you are craving right now, do not let it win… make yourself the winner instead.  Kick that ugly cig habit to the curb like a bad relationship and take control of yourself.  You will never regret it.
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! What a powerful story! I have the EXACT same story, except mine turned out a little differently. Needless to say, I committed myself back to nicotine addiction. I wish I would have pulled out of that parking lot just like you.....smoke free and with freedom from nicotine. You have almost 5 years. I only have 1 day because I got out of the car and went inside. Now, I have to start over, and you are 5 years ahead of me. Well, 5 years is only time. My next 5 will be smoke free.
Wonderful post.  Thank you, Rain.
Awful to say but I was relieved to read you were 2 months into your quit and found yourself sitting there debating going in to buy a pack.  I am a month into my quit and still have to fight with myself some days (like today) not to fly off to the gas station because I've got myself convinced that I NEED one. You give me hope that its still normal to feel these brutal craves and that it'll eventually go away.
I do that are old girlfriends houses but the police call it stalking. I tried to say I was just making up my mind, but they don't buy it.
Little moments - I have always believed that it is those little moments....or looooong moment in this case that we look back on. Great post Rain!
Great post!   You never did NEED a cigarette Donna10, nicotine just made you think so.
IAmDoingIt, be proud of yourself for choosing to become a non-smoker now.  By the way, I would have been over 7 years quit, but I did relapse.  Don’t be too hard on yourself now… it’s time to look ahead and not look back!  Have a plan of something else to do when you crave: I smoked “pretend cigs” (plastic straws cut to cig-length)… and it worked… my brain actually believed it because I would get the same ritual including flicking fake ashes… lol Donna, the longer we’re quit the easier it becomes.  After a month, I didn’t have many craves, but when I did get one, it was really powerful.  You’re doing really good… believe in yourself… make YOU be the WINNER this time, not the cig… you can do it!
Great story, Rain...thanks for sharing! The last time I had a crave as I pulled up to the gas station and had to go in for something, I smelled my ashtray. It worked.  The thought of buying cigs left my head just as quickly as it appeared.  
    Bump!  Good advice from Rain who is now past a decade!
    I used to buy my smokes at the corner gas station.  I would never buy any more than one pack a day because I was always going to quit.  That meant a visit to the station every day because I never could quit.  I did become good friends with the man that owned the gas station.  I enjoyed talking with him every day.      I am ten months quit and often think I should stop and tell him I quit and miss talking to him.  Every time I pull into the station to tell him, I pull right back out.  I do not want to visit my old haunt.  I will always keep him a pleasant memory but I have no need for his store.  The gas is cheaper on the other side of town.  
Hey guys. Its juan.         I wanna be honest even though i am ashamed i could not quit smoking. That is why i left the forum. I want to quit again. But about my personal life you should know a few details that iam ashamed.     Thank to god i dont have money problems. I have a rent from my apartment but i live in my mothers house. Unemployed and with a lot of free time. I had a depression very strong last year and im seeing a doctor for this.      The thing is i smoke to kill time. I really want to quit but the free time its killing me. I just wanted to be honest. I really had a rough time with mayor treatment resistent depression so its not like i dont want to study or work. I could not get out of bed     im 32. Used to be a rugby player.       I started the gym 2 weeks ago.  sorry for the bad spelling. I have not writen in english for a few years. thank you all. The problem is lots of free time. And depression
    Welcome back Juan, glad you've been visiting again. Have you picked a new quit date because you can quit smoking. We're all proof of that. Many of us have dealt with anxiety and depression and found that although it may worsen in the beginning, it actually gets better by quitting and staying quit.  Working out is a great way to relieve some of your boredom. There's also volunteering you can do.   I wish I had of been smart enough to quit at your age instead of waiting until my health made me have to quit. Stick close to the board. Post an SOS if you feel yourself caving to a crave and give us a chance to help you past it. You owe it to yourself. You can do it 
    Hello Juan . Welcome back .     I like your post because we have lots of things in common . I have depression too . I used to smoke to kill time too .      But i threw it away because of health related concerns .        I still feel like smoking  not because of the cravings but because i don't have anything else interesting to do .       And all the interesting things in the world requires a lot of money , which i don't have too much either .      I am going through a time of recession , There will be a time of recovery and expansion too , Lol       Anyway Everyone has depression because of too much boredom i guess .        Try to find some activities you might find interesting to kill that boredom .                                
    Thank you both of you
    Welcome back Juan.      I'm a bit confused. Have you quit or are you saying you can't quit because of boredom?      Depression and boredom are two very different things. People get fed up because they are bored but it doesn't cause depression. I think you need to separate these two things or you will continue to use this as a reason to relapse.       
    Welcome back, Juan.         Free time was a tough thing for me too when I was trying to quit smoking.  Finding other ways to occupy your time helps, like what Jill said with working out or volunteering.  Keeping yourself occupied really helps.  Spend time on this board.  There are lots of things to do other than smoking.      I hope you stick around and succeed in your quit.  A smoke-free life is a great thing.
    Juan, be aware that the tricky voice of addiction will take any minor annoyance and blow it up into a major catastrophe which you can use as an excuse not to stick with your quit.  I'm not saying that boredom isn't irritating for you.  But if you were really busy and stressed out, would you be using that as a reason not to quit?  What I'm getting at is, there are always curveballs in life.  There will never be a "perfect" time to quit and there will always be something you can use as an excuse not to even bother.  Sure hope you can get your mind to that place where it needs to be so you can enjoy the benefits of a life free from smoking.  It's worth the effort.
    Welcome back Juan, glad to see that you came back (also thank you for being honest -- that can be hard at times).  Depression can be crippling but it sounds like you are aware and taking steps to overcome.  Also too much time on your hands (song title there) can be a problem.  When I quit I was a year into my retirement and was very concerned about all that time and how it would impact my quit, I used it to my advantage and spend a lot of time here on the forum (still do) and that helped pass the time and the craves, it also helps you set a goal.  Either way you can do this so hopefully you will stick around and set that new quit date in the very near future!!!!
    Hi Juan.  I am so glad you have come back.  It is so great you can be honest with us because then we know how to guide you.  I also deal with anxiety and depression.  Depression can make you feel very isolated and alone.  Well you are not that anymore.  You have all of us here wanting to help lift you up and guide you to freedom from your addiction.  You will be amazed how quitting gives you power and a huge boost in your self esteem. Smoking just plays into our feelings of  low self esteem.    Let's get this quit going.  Hang around and play some games.  Start pledging the Nope pledge.  Share with us your feelings.  There is a wonderful group here that wants to help you.     
    Welcome back, Juan...smoking to kill time is a bad idea, use time to kill smoking. Going back to the gym is a good thing. Since you like Rugby, maybe you could get in touch with some people who like to play Rugby. Depression and Boredom are two different things. Boredom is when you have nothing to do and Depression is you have no will to do anything because of some past traumatic experience or because of a really messed up situation. One could also be depressed because he/she is bored. Sometimes the line between the two can be blurred, but its important to keep the two separate. Think of some more things you like to do and work toward it. Its a very good thing you have rental income, at least dependency (if any) on family for money can be done away with. Maybe, try investing a part of that rental income. If you're on medication to treat your depression, it would be advisable to make an informed decision about the medication as such medication can cause side effects that may hinder your physical well-being. Check on the internet at authentic websites about the side effects (and if its FDA approved) and talk to your doctor if anything about the medication concerns you. Hopefully the doctor will not treat you poorly when you confront him/her about the lousy medication, if at all it is lousy, that is prescribed.
    Hello Juan. I just wanted to welcome you and ask if you have already quit again or are you still planning your quit. The good people here will give you all the support you need to quit once you take that first step. Hope you stick around on Quit Train because support from other quitters does make a difference. An there is no shame in having a relapse. Use it as a stepping stone to a successful quit  
    It's been a week. Where ya been, Juan?  EZPZ
    Juan ,  Glad to see you again ....how you getting along ....post and update us ...
    Good to see ya!!!!
                Quit smoking and reduce the risk of breathing problems, heart disease and many forms of cancer.      
    Most definitely it can as I have attested to.  Smoking leads to so many health problems -- so it takes from your health and your wallet.  Quit now it can only help you!!!
Spoiler                     I have spent quite a bit at the dentist, that pic is nasty if anyone needs a reason to quit LOOK

    F _____!!!      Fill in the blank with your former cigarette brand if you want to tell it to "F off" .*  F Vantage!!!       *Yes, I know we have to accept personal responsibility for starting to smoke and ultimately becoming addicted. But I still hate RJ Reynolds, the maker of my former brand Vantage, and I'll never give them another penny.  I'm free now and that's how life should be lived.

    Oh Yes, I am all for this!!!!        
https://tobaccoatlas.org/topic/health-effects           Health Effects  Using any tobacco product is harmful. Inhaling tobacco smoke exposes users to more than 7000 toxicants and at least 70 carcinogens, damaging the whole body. A regular smoker typically loses more than a decade of life.   Tobacco use is one of the most important preventable causes of premature death in the world. More than 6 million people per year die from tobacco use across the globe. There is no question that limiting tobacco use is one of the most effective ways to save lives and improve overall well-being.  Smoking tobacco causes exposure to a lethal mixture of more than 7000 toxic chemicals, including at least 70 known carcinogens that can damage nearly every organ system in the human body. Harms from tobacco begin before birth, as pregnant women who smoke give birth to infants at higher risk of congenital disorders, cancer, lung diseases, and sudden death. Newly identified risks from smoking include renal failure, intestinal ischemia, and hypertensive heart disease. The risk of death and disease from tobacco rises with the number of cigarettes smoked, but damage begins with use of a very small number of cigarettes. A regular life-long smoker loses at least 10–11 years of life to tobacco on average. In addition, exposure to secondhand or environmental tobacco smoke is associated with increased risk of cancer and heart disease, among other deleterious health effects.    Lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in the world. It has long been the leading cause of cancer death among men, and in many countries is now also the leading cause of cancer death among women, outpacing breast cancer. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death in the world, and mortality from this condition is increasing in most countries; globally, 45% of all deaths from COPD are attributed to tobacco use. Similarly, death from heart disease and stroke, the two leading causes of death in the world, are heavily tied to tobacco use.  Combustible tobacco use is extremely hazardous to human health and is responsible for more than 90% of tobacco-attributable death and disease, despite efforts by the tobacco industry to market safer-sounding alternatives such as low-tar cigarettes and water pipes. Therefore, a top priority is to avoid combustible tobacco products, and the only way for an individual to completely eliminate tobacco-related harms is not to use them.       Percent of DALYs Attributable to Tobacco Use    Tobacco use is responsible for a large proportion of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) - the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.    0%19.0% No data Download    Share   Deaths from tobacco Tobacco contributes to most of the leading causes of death in the world and half of all smokers will die from tobacco-related illnesses IschemicheartdiseaseCerebrovasculardisease(strokes)ChronicobstructivepulmonarydiseaseLowerrespiratoryinfectionsTracheal,bronchus,andlungcancerDiabetesmellitusTuberculosisTobaccouseCause of Death0246810Deaths (millions)Not tobacco-relatedTobacco-related

Is this similar to the great American smoke out that is on November 15

I tried the strongest patch when I first quit but it was a bit too much for me so used the middle one instead. So did 10 weeks on that one  and yesterday I started the lowest patch.       I could really notice the difference but came here and posted when it got too much. The plan is to be on this one for 2-4 weeks.        Anyway, I'm feeling really happy I got through the day so wanted to share this little milestone                      Edited May 24 by Lilly

I'm sure there will be some volatility with cravings and anxiety as you step down each time but that's to be expected. Come here to vent or for support. You have the knowledge now on how to fight the cravings and you have your vision of a smoke-free Lilly so your quit is assured as long as you continue to work your plan faithfully each and every day  
    Good going Lilly!
    Lilly, you are working your plan, good for you! 
    Good going, @Lilly
    Thanks everyone.        The support and encouragement keeps me going so it's really appreciated x 
    Good job, Lilly!
    Great job Lilly.  You're doing fantastic!
    Great job, great attitude.  It should keep getting easier overall from here.  As you know, it's not always completely linear,  but you get better and better at dealing with any bumps in the road. 
    Fantastic job Lilly, you have had a great plan -- Keep it going!!!!
Keep fighting .     In my melodramatic fight with cigarettes .There was only one thing that have helped me to stay away from this addiction .   It was the 4mg strong nicotine gums .   If on any given day i have to choose between a cigarette and a gum , i would chose this 4mg gum .       Also one simple rule too .      No matter how melodramatic this addiction looks like .  I am not going out to buy cigarette's for me .

If on any given day i have to choose between a cigarette and a gum , i would chose this 4mg gum .                                       Also one simple rule too .                                      No matter how melodramatic this addiction looks like .

    A good choice Lilly .       I should seriously stop bringing up NRT gums in discussions      
    You are doing great Lilly.  You've got this now!
    Great job Lilly. We got this. You are doing a terrific job

We all know the more known problems from years of smoking (Cancer, COPD, Heart problems and such) but their are some problems that are lesser known.    Today I am going to the dentist to start fixing my mouth.  Most of the problems are tied in with my smoking over those many years, something I really did not think about. For the past year it has been very difficult for me to eat and also a lot of pain. Now I have been dealing with COPD (at this point stage 1 and has done much better since quitting and not really advancing at this point) but now I have to deal with all these upcoming dental appointments to include 3 different appointments for oral surgery (first this morning) then several appointments to replace several missing teeth.  I do not enjoy going to the dentist but most of all I do not enjoy what this will be doing to my wallet.  At this point it is going to be close to $20,000.00  (there goes all the money I have been saving from my quitting).  The main point here is not sympathy for me but to let others know to include those that are lurking and have yet to make the choice to quit is that you really need to understand everything that smoking cigarettes can do to you.  It all sneaks up on you and will cost you both to health and to your wallet.  I have done this to myself and I must take accountability for my actions but hopefully others will see this and do some serious thinking!!!!!!!     Quit now so that you can live a better life in so many ways!!!!!        Sorry about the long post but I get really anxious about going to the dentist, oh alright -- scared, and it is about an hour before I can take the sedative -- anyway good day to all.Edited May 29 by Martian5
    Thanks for this post martian,  and I'm sorry you're going through all that  
Yeah - oral surgery sucks for sure (and is costly)! It's not the actual surgery so much as the aftermath healing.  At least now you will heal faster and it will be worth the $$ you put into it because you are no longer creating the problems that got you to this point so that's one good thing.       Another disease closely related to smoking that isn't in the forefront much is Buerger's disease:"Virtually everyone diagnosed with Buerger's disease smokes cigarettes or uses other forms of tobacco, such as chewing tobacco. Quitting all forms of tobacco is the only way to stop Buerger's disease. For those who don't quit, amputation of all or part of a limb is sometimes necessary."         Edited May 29 by reciprocity
    Martian thank you for this. It's a reminder that smoking is responsible for problems we don't even think about.         I'm sorry to hear you're suffering and hope you get it all sorted quickly x
I feel your pain Martian.  I posted a very similar dental nightmare earlier this year.  Smoking destroys in so many ways.  I ended up having complete implants at just under $50K out-of-pocket.    Good luck on your process.
I also posted a dental nightmare.  I had put $27,000.00 into my mouth previously and now all my implants have failed and I am looking at $10,000.00 more dental work. I have gotten a number of opinions and the consensus was not good.  Between smoking and osteoporosis I have had so much bone loss, they may not be able to replace my implants.  I also will not have enough bone to hold false teeth on the bottom.  The periodontist is going to do my surgery next week and says he will only be able to tell, at that time. if any implants can be put in.
Thanks all, back from the dentist now and bit sore (at least I have meds for the pain).  5 more appointments and two will be more oral surgery  -- take one bridge out and removal of some more teeth, then the dental implant surgery when the healing is done.  At least I am getting it taken care of, though it will cost money at least the money I am saving from quitting is going to able to pay a good deal of that

Hi!  I've been gone for a month or so.  Living life.  Loathing life.  Loving life.  All that jazz.  During these months of living life and all that jazz,  I lost my job - or rather - it lost me?  Reduction in force.  Workforce reduction.  Position no longer needed.  Blah blah yadda yadda.  I have several months of severance and no job.       In a haze, I ventured out to the pharmacy to get some headache remedy and some other sundries.      The check out cashier was pleasant and engaging.  We talked about the weather.  Not the government (note the R.E.M. reference).     I swiped my card.  It was accepted.  I still have funds.  Yay!      I looked past my new friend.  I noticed all the packs of cigarettes.  I saw my enemy; the yellow ones.      Then, I felt the reality sink in.       After hearing the news my job no longer existed...I did not think about smoking.        I did not think about smoking.  I did not think about NOT smoking.  I did not think about anything having to do with smoking until I saw the packs.     Then, I thought...good thing I don't smoke anymore, that crap is crazy expensive.  And it is one less thing to worry about.         Then, I thought...holy shit!  I just lost my job and the thought of smoking never crossed my mind until I saw packs of cigs.        Then, I thought...holy shit! I was not even tempted to buy any!  No internal struggle, nothing, other than relief to not have to worry about it.        Then, I thought...my Lust4Life took a hit but is still shining.     So is yours.
You, my dear, have a wonderful outlook.   I am so sorry that you lost your job and will pray that something better comes along.     I am at awe in your strength and resolve.  I don't know whether I would not have caved.   You do have a wonderful Lust4Life and I think things will work out better.
@Linda Thomas  thank you so much for your kind words.  I feel like sometimes we live in a mine zone of "what ifs".  Tip toe. What will detonate our sleeping bomb?  Years after it fell into slumber? Nothing.  We got this.
    Sorry about your job lust  I'm sure with your positive outlook a new job is soon to come, and it could just end up to be your dream job This post is proof that with time all quitters can feel the same way about smoking as you do, even when they feel like they never will, so thanks for sharing, xoxo
@jillar you know it!  Job loss has some perks...this is the first time I've perused QT on an actual computer vs phone/tablet.  What a difference!  So fancy!     
    It's a defining moment when you realise you didn't go to the old and outdated "I'm stressed I need to smoke like a chimney" method of 'coping' with stress.     I hope you find a great job soon!
Sorry about the job loss, L4L...At least you have several months severance...will allow for some breathing space while you start the hunt!  One door closes....another one opens...and may it lead to an even better job for you!
    Imagine job hunting and trying to mask the stench of stale smoke on your clothing and hair; slugging a capful of mouthwash; trying to scrub the yellow stains off your fingers.     Not to mention having that nagging feeling in the back of your mind during a job interview of “when the hell is this going to end so I can run outside and have a smoke?”   Without all that BS to worry about, the real,  positive you can shine through. Undoubtedly, she’s the one who gets hired  
Hey L4L, good that you wrote that down. These are the memorable moments, important part of out quits. It shows how far youve come in cutting ties with addiction. And isnt it absurd how strong reactions to these images are, seeing a pack and instantly wanting one? Good thing is, that effect will diminish over time as well. Than its just a pack of cigarettes, without meaning.        I whish you the best in dealing with the job loss and the hunt for something new!
    Loosing an income source is horrible. Happy to know that you didn't think of smoking!!!
I'm job hunting.  Just FYI to lurkers- some places require a "smobriety" test.  Meaning, they are a 100% tobacco and NICOTINE free company.  Each applicant must consent to a blood test to detect any nicotine in their system.  ANY meaning one must disclose the use of NRT or vaping.       Easy peasy lemon squezzy from this sour puss.

I am shocked.  I did not realize this was legal in the U.S. I could see a test for drugs but not smoking.  Smoking is not illegal (though it should be) It must feel good to have this plus on your job hunting side.   Know that I am praying something comes along soon.
    Sorry to read about the job loss but so impressed by your great attitude. Will be keeping you in my thoughts and prayers that all goes well. Thanks for your great outlook on keeping your quit.  
    Being alone tested my quit the most.  Just me and my addiction....   
    Ironically the thing that has tested my quit the most isn't me or smoking - it's other people.      Oh you're using NRT     You haven't really quit as your still using nicotine        How long is this one going to last      Then there's the "how to quit properly police". If you're not doing it how they think it should be done you're doomed.      Oh and shops who don't stock marmite crisps. They are my go to crave buster and I get a bit panicked when I can't find them.

As long as you follow a plan to use NRT products safely and properly with an aim to reduce and get off altogether then who cares. It's the path that works for YOU.  You're getting into no man's land where most don't want to hear about the struggles you still go through in quitting. Your hopes and your fears about having a successful life long quit. The people here on this forum do though and that's when I believe it's most important that people stick around. Once that shine wears off the brand new quit and it's just down to working what you've learned until you are on solid ground.     We don't stock or sell marmite crisps though - you're on your own with that one
@reciprocity everything you have said made complete sense and helps.        The forum is a lifeline for me and as you say everyone here understands. I might go and read up on some no man's land stuff later on this afternoon.        I might get a bag of Smokey Bacon today to honour you

No, no.... no!      Was just binging 'Dead to me', netflix series. So far, so good. Ok for a saturday evening on the couch, tea, beers and crochet. Right in the middle of the 4th episode, clues come together, secrets are out in the open, two girl friends having dinner and wine and the dirt is literally on the dinner table. Tears, anger, some jealous car scratching and then.... one of  'm buys cigarettes and the other one says she loves her for it...! And ofcourse they light up and immediately calm down and have a reasonable conversation... oh right.         I am in shock! This is soooo Marlboro man old fashion.. how can they still do it like that? I thought we were past that? Apparantly NOT.        The only nice thing about it... i felt true repulsion. Really, what a cheap move.       -Edit- ah I was too quick. She cant get it lit! Well. What about that. Weird.    Edited May 18 by MLMR
I suppose the reality of life is that millions of people still smoke. I think by removing smoking/drinking/drugs it would also remove that reality of life.         We are quitters so we view that scene differently to a lot of other people. Never smokers and smokers probably never even viewed it the way you did - in fact they probably never thought about it at all.          I once blew a quit because someone was smoking in a programme. How pathetic is that lol.        Hope things are ok with you.  Sounds like a perfect evening to me.  Only thing I would add is some cheese and onion crisps                   Edited May 18 by Lilly

    The part I find disturbing is that hey are promoting the lie we all buy into, that smoking calms you in a tense situation. This is the major stumbling block for many people quitting. Not understanding the difference between nicotine addiction stress and life stress. Cigarettes only solve one kind of stress and it's NOT life stress!

No they kids who fought didn't because even doctors smoked back then. The issuing of cigs during wartime was a major boost to Big Tobacco.

Everything I've read says the health risks were highlighted in the fifties which is obviously after the war so I'm still confused.      I have family who fought in both wars and none of them smoke thankfully.

Yeah - I've seem footage of kids like 6 or 7 puffing away in Indonesia. Disgusting! I went to Europe a few years ago and was shocked at how many smokers there still were (and I was a smoker then too). Also, here in Canada, the Province of Quebec is very bad for smoking. Up until a year ago you could still get smoking rooms in some hotels. A lot of French Canadians smoke like crazy. One of their own Provincial party leaders was a chain smoker. Never saw him without a smoke in his mouth. Oh .... guess what? He's dead now  Edited May 19 by reciprocity
@reciprocity there was a video that went viral of a four year old and then a 3 year old smoking (both from Indonesia).      Teenagers make their own choices but it broke my heart to see those babies.

Our 2016 quitters are the butt kickers. 2017 we have the Smoke Busters, 2015 are known as the Badashes and 2014, The Avengers. I don't know what happened to the 2018 members not having a name but it's never too late. So 2019 quitters, are you guys going to unite with a team name?
I like Ashkickers, myself. I'm sure it's been used at some point, though. Or maybe X-Smokers. (Like X-Men.)                  Edited April 2 by abbynormal
    Ashkickers is a good one!
    We will need someone far more tech-savvy than myself to come up with a logo!
    Yeah, I don't have any graphics talent.  Maybe we have someone creative here?
Wasn't the 2018 group the Ex-Cigutioners or The Resistance? I think QSMB shut down before they finalized the vote? I found the Resistance logo that someone created....
Hows this for the Ashkickers???      Edited April 4 by notsmokinjo

I don't remember quit train members from 2018 picking a name but I like what Rozuki presented from QSMB  for the resistance 2018!!
    I've got it in my signature now!
    And it looks great there @abbynormal   
    I think the logo is awesome. Great work 
    oooh  I'm an Avenger?  I'll need to put a "No Smoking" sticker on my Iron Man suit.      
Hey ya'll!! I am super proud bc i am 9 months smoke free!!!! Again, I am blessed bc i have had no cravings at all! Life is better, anxiety significantly decreased as well. It was torture when i quit years ago, but this i am so grateful for!    How are you all doing? I always lurk haha, thanking you all again
    Congratulations Christa! I'm glad this quit has been so easy for you, you're definitely one of the lucky ones  
Great job on the 9 month mark, glad everything is going good for you on this quit -- keep strong!!!!
Congrats Christa! 9 months is amazing, and good to hear its going well too, that is a blessing
Could you clarify if you are several years quit or 9 months quit? Just asking because you mention that you're 9 months quit and then say that you quit years ago. Either way, congratulations on a great quitEdited May 14 by Ankush
Big congrats on 9 months Christa. That's fabulous and yes, having an easier time is a blessing. That doesn't happen often. Stay vigilant though and we'll be soon celebrating your 1 year!      Now, where you at? We're already partying in recognition of this anniversary. Common down!!
    Congrats Christa! Good to know that youre still here. Happy to hear about your anxiety decreasing, thats terrific news. 
    Congratulations Christa.        I always enjoy watching the benefits of quitting accumulate for a fellow traveler.

So yeah, I smoked for 30 years. I never smoked in the house, which meant I was either in the front or back yard smoking. Never really thought about how it was for my neighbors that didn't smoke.      So now here I am, 2+ years quit and I have a neighbor that smokes and I'll be damned if I don't have a conniption every time I smell it. I purposely (and passively aggressively) shut the windows harder than I need to so they're sure to hear it. I sometimes will even say a bit too loudly "GOD! It f***ing stinks out here!" so I know they hear me. Thing is, they're pretty cool neighbors and I really shouldn't be such an ass.   But I am an ass. It angers me to no end that they couldn't care less that they're polluting MY house with smoke from THEIR disgusting habit.        I would never lecture someone about quitting smoking. That's not my business, but man, I'm a big baby when it comes to other people's smoke.        Me, of all people...        I guess the only thing worse than a smoke is an ex-smoker.      That is all
    I guess it would have been OK to say something to your neighbors if you had never picked up smoking and even then, it is not your choice (no offense meant) to tell anybody what they can or cannot do with their lives. If they're good neighbors as you say, sit down with them and talk to them directly rather than shutting the windows harder than usual or passing comments.
You could always get a fan.  They might get the message Jim I think now that we have found our freedom, we have no patience for the filthy habit.
    Ooh lord.       I get that smells can be offensive. Someone who lives in my road has a dog and the dog always insists on saying hello. Sometimes I just want to scream " tell your stinking dog to piss off". I don't have dogs and I don't take kindly to pet owners who think it's ok to allow theirs to come and lick my feet or jump up at me. They lick their @rse and then they use that same tongue to lick strangers yuck!                       
    That is being hypocritical Jim, my next door neighbors smoke too and they b.b.que every weekend so since the wind always blows from the west we can smell the smoke inside our house as well. However, I would never even think about telling them not to smoke or b.b.que in their own yard. I know that they have put up with many a loud night coming from our house with the music blaring and people drinking and talking over the music lol
    Here's one, I just got back this week from a week long cruise. I didn't realize or pay attention to just how many people actually smoked before. My spouse still smokes so I went up to the smoking side one afternoon. I couldn't get over the smell that was up there. I found myself feeling like you Jim. I ended up telling her I didn't belong there any longer and left. I left feeling like a snob but I couldn't help it. I pray I never fall because I saw so much self destruction that week ,  and I honestly don't remember noticing that or smelling that much smoke. I actually found myself struggling to breathe at times. I like this so much better, let's never fail.
Last cruise I was on, I only felt sorry for the people who were huddled underneath the stairwell smoking all day long.  Same people, all the time, every day = slavery to addiction  Why not take full advantage of the $$ you have spent to go on a cruise instead of huddling under cover smoking? Just goes to show how powerful this addiction is.Edited May 12 by reciprocity

I agree that it's strange having them all huddled under cover because it does hold the smoke in there more than if it were completely open. I was on one ship where the smoking area was up on the top deck in a completely open area but most are not. Maybe it's covered so people can still smoke when it rains or maybe so ashes aren't blowing all over the place?         Frankly, I'm surprised not one cruise line that I'm aware of has banned smoking all together - not one! It's a huge fire issue as you can imagine. You don't want to be floating in the middle of the ocean with a fire breaking out. I'm betting some cruise line will do it sometime soon. It's a very small percentage of people that I see smoking on a cruise so they aren't going to lose too many customers if they ban it outright and a lot of their non smoking customers would applaud them for having a smoke-free cruise
In my addiction, the morning was the time of day when I would bang out 4 or 5 cigs. with a cup of coffee and watch the news before work.  This morning I realized that my routine is still the same minus the cigs and my flesh is not screaming/crawling for one!! I was so happy because my first few days of my quit that was the most difficult for me.  You all said it would get easier and it is. I just wanted to share that with you. Thank you
Did you relapse? Your counter is off. Quitting is about time. The more time, the easier it becomes. You done completed your daily milestones and now you're working on weeks. Keep looking forward to the next one (2nd week in your case) for a sense of accomplishment. It's a very good feeling when the milestones are achieved. Get to your monthly milestones and it becomes much better. The milestones really start to pay off...………...You can do this, we have.
Hi, my quit date is March 12, 2019. I quit smoking before I joined the group and  then I was having problems setting the darn thing!! But thank you Ethan I am looking onward and upward    No I didn't relapseDo you know how I can correct that
    Well looka here I fixed it!
    Glad you're feeling so good already QueenB, you've almost got two months under your belt now so onward and upward, you're doing awesome 
    Thank you Jillar. I don't want to sound like I'm over-the-top with this, but no one could have told me that this was possible FOR ME!! I was a tough little mama about my cigarettes! Not anymore, I am a non-smoker and I'm LOVING IT      Hey Ethan, we can chalk it up to the foggy brain. LOL
    Great job, your getting the jist of it now -- !!!
    Great going QueenB
Thank you all for the encouragement.  It was NOT easy and I certainly don't want to come across like it was.  I worked very hard, educated myself, and still have a lot of work to do! I'm just happy in this moment.  In my research(IDK where)I came across something that said, at the beginning of your initial quit most people will be very encouraging, supportive. But after say 3rd  week and laterPeople have forgotten/don't care about your quit.  YOU, then in turn have to encourage yourself as you go through this process. It's an awesome time if you can get through the first couple of days. I do anything, any how, any way NOT  to take another puff.
@jillar do your bump thing with the mental balloons for QueenB x

I used to see people smoking outside restaurants or at a party and I was so jealous that they got to keep smoking and I had to quit.  Which really makes no sense since I chose to quit, but that's the feeling I had anyway.  I quit smoking on December 27th 2017, and that feeling of jealousy went away a few months ago.  Now I see people smoking and I feel bad that they have to take that time to feed their craving.  Usually they're standing all by themselves and it doesn't look like much fun. It looks like a compulsion.        I was thinking about it this morning on my way home from taking the kids to school because I realized I was in no rush to be anywhere.  I used to be in a rush to go home and have my smoke, because I hid it from my kids and would wait for them to get to school so I could feed my craving.  I have saved so much time in my life day to day by not having to stand alone on the porch smoking a cigarette.  Not to even mention the time I've hopefully saved by not dying young from some smoking-related disease.
    I had the same feelings of why do they get to smoke and I have to quit! Glad you're doing so well farmgirl and thank you for the great post 
    Farmgirl,  I was the same with my kids.  I would get them to school and could not wait to relax and have my cigarette.  I knew then that it was wrong and did not want my children following my path.   As far as watching others smoke, I never felt jealous that they could and I was quitting.  I kind of chuckle now, because I critique how they smoke.  Some take long drags and savor their cigarette and some take quick, little puffs and have to flick their ash every time.  None of them look sexy or mature to me, which is the lure that made me want to smoke when I was a young adult.  I have so much empathy for them.  The young ones most likely haven't gotten it yet.  Then I wonder if the older ones feel as I did - ashamed and helplessly stuck?  
    I feel envy when I see smokers. I think because I've quit for good reasons but not because I really wanted to. If there wasn't a dying/health risk with smoking I'd still be doing it.      I'm pleased for you Farmgirl and glad you are so happy with your quit. 
    I don't feel envy when I see smokers puffing away on a cigarette. I haven't seen any smokers in a long time (I always look down and walk) but I can get the smell of cigarettes. And when I get the smell of cigarettes, the thought I immediately get in my mind is "Crap, I hope I don't relapse".

    I no longer feel envy for smokers when I see them.  I look at what I used to do and be and those are not good thoughts anymore.  I now look at smokers in some sort of amazement that they continue to doing harm to themselves -- and many times they look so lonely and at times agitated with what they are doing -- keeps me strong on my own quit at this time!!!

    The title of this thread says it all. That's exactly what I feel now when I see some poor soul standing alone feeding their addiction while the world passes them by.   As Boo said; there's nothing to miss about smoking  
    "The lows become the highs."  I heard that line in a video I was watching last night about the Bob Graham Round, a fell running ultramarathon in England.  The quote is true of any challenge, including quitting smoking.      When I look back at the early days of my quit, it's not the anniversaries and milestones that are really emblazoned on my brain.  It is those moments of discomfort and struggle that I remember fondly now.  Distance and time allow me to laugh at those moments now, but in that moment, the easiest thing to do would have been simply to light up a cigarette and carry on with killing myself with smoking.       I chose to stay smokefree.  Even when that voice of addiction was screaming and thrashing about, I stayed true to my commitment.  What looked like the easy route was actually the most difficult.  Lighting up would have kept me on the same endless cycle of addiction, regret, and self loathing I was looking to escape.  Quitting, simply not smoking, seemed to be the difficult route at the time but turned out to be more rewarding than I could have imagined at the time.       Rarely is anything worth having attained without some effort.  The struggle you embrace today may turn out to be one of your greatest rewards.
When something is fundamental there emerge a flood of quotes and expressions to capture that truth.  I like the axiom "The lows become the highs."   I have a quote under my ticker that evokes a similar sentiment.New beginnings are often disguised as painful endings.  Thanks for the wise words Boo.  Stick with it newbies.  You'll get to that point where the awful lows you feel initially will, in retrospect, become the badges of honor on your way to an amazing new life.         Edited May 9 by BKP
Thanks for this.  I too do not look back at milestones during my quit, I also remember the difficult times along with the early struggles.  The only milestone I really remember is the 1 year mark since I was truly amazed that I made it that far.   My quote of late has been "With every challenge comes new opportunities", I have found great opportunities since quitting!!!!!

It always seemed impossible until I met all of you.   The addiction makes you feel as if it is impossible.  Now, I feel like I have run the marathon but that you were all there to hold me up and help me cross the finish line.The smoking is just a distant thought now.  I have the power to live life without it.  Thank you    
    Great post boo and while I can't say I look back at the difficult days fondly, I can say that I'm happy to be past them 
    Thank you Boo for this great post, I also feel so proud of standing up to that "voice" and ploughing on with my quit.   Today I feel very different...
    I feel very proud of all of you. I'm still at the hard stage so knowing you all stuck it out is awesome.        Well done all of you x

For Nancy       Mental Balloons Posted by gonfishn21 on 16 January 2015 - 06:17 PM  As I'm now chasing the tweenie label, and have been thinking a lot about the concerns I have had regading No Man's Land, its got me thinking again. As most of you know, that means I'm going to ramble.    Although I am not one that needs a lot of kudos, it seems that it is a necessary part of this process for a while.  We make it through day 1 HURRAH!!!!!!!!!!   We make it through hell week HURRAY!!!! Heck week over, " I feel better" HURRAy!!   Two weeks, wow, learning to get through the craves, HURRay! Three weeks, can be around my friends and family without committing a felony, HURray    Four weeks, nerves under control, waistband a little tight, not bad, HUrray Five weeks, walking, eating right, digestion shut down, but not smoking, Hurray Six weeks, no craves, no moods, no smoking, digestion shut down, HUH?   Seven to eight weeks, no one wants to know but you, how you are doing. By the way, my digestion is shut down!   They really stopped wanting to hear weeks ago, you just kept talking about it. You can see it in their eyes when you walk up. They probably have a pool about how long it will take you to bring it up. Or even worse, the day your digestion works!    Yeah, wow woot woot yippee, big deal.   Hello No Man's Land'    How am i going to keep going with this? I need to bring my own ballons to the party. I know my friends and family care, but they dont get it.   Even as firm as I have been since day one, this is one of the hardest things I have ever done. I know it, thats all that matters.   As i reach the little milestones ahead, I need to be the one who says HURRAY!!!!!.  I need to be the one who acknowledges the accomplishments. Afterall, in the end, I made the decision to quit, I made it through hell week, heck week, and i am the one who may never digest food again. I need to remind myself everyday, how much I have accomplished, BEFORE I have a chance to get weak. In that way, I can stay ahead, be ready to face any challenge with a strong defense.    Smoking is no longer an option for me. Smoking is just something I used to do. I control my actions, and smoking is a choice. I choose not to smoke, even if I never digest food again. I found a website the other day, that actually teaches you HOW TO SMOKE. I couldn't believe it. It takes you through lighting it, drawing on it, how it feels.......Holy Crap I was feeling it!!!!! Two flipping months into this, and I was feeling it, and then I knew. I had to make mental ballons and carry them with me at all times. Everyday is a celebration, everyday needs reminders, and everyday has its challenges. There is no one here, that can not do it. I'm not special. I'm just going to carry my own balloons.   Just sayin, Gon
    Bump
OMG.. I remember this post so well.. it was just what I needed to hear in the early days of my quit.. I have treasured your words ever since gonfishn.      And yes, 1 year 8 months down the line I am still carrying my mental balloons because I am proud of me
 
    Oh yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about!!
This is my second attempt quitting with Chantix. I have just finished my starter pack and have already gone from 20+ cigarettes a day to around 8-10. I am wondering if i added a nicotine patch would that be counter productive, since I have already reduced my nicotine intake by reducing the number of cigarettes a day?
    I would say no. The whole point is to rid yourself of nicotine. Not string yourself along. Smoke until your quite date and then don't smoke.        Stick with what your Dr. recommends.
    Welcome aboard Mike, I agree with Jim above.  Chantix is designed to reduce your overall desire to smoke.  Again I would discuss this with your Dr.  
    Welcome Mike and congratulations on your decision to quit. I agree with above. Why would you want to add the patch? Now that you are through the starter pack the pills are stronger and will help further reduce your desire to smoke.
I probably would check with your doctor.        I'm no expert but isn't champix supposed to do something to the nicotine receptors. If the idea is to make you dislike smoking adding loads more nicotine would surely be almost fighting against what it does. As I say I'm no expert.     Give the champix a chance to do its thing. It's clearly working so see where you are in a few days more.        I know in my quit smoking clinic they advise eating half yiur breakfast, then take the champix, then finish your breakfast. It apparently helps to stop the nausea feeling IF you get that. Edited May 8 by Lilly
I wonder, what about smoking is it that made me live life from the sideline?    Looking back at my smokey years, its like Ive been on a constant watch for smoke facilitating circumstances. It was ALWAYS in the back of my mind, I was building life around smoking instead of the other way 'round. I dont know how I did that. It seems so, so tiring!  I cant help but feel like one of those actors in a Tell Sell commercial: its amaaaaaazing!! But... It really is, to me. Time is flying (since 5, 6 weeks) and every morning I wake up after a good night of sleep. Instead of cursing the whole world and whishing not to be talked to before Ive had coffee and at least three cigarettes, I actually do usefull sensible stuff like sleeping a bit late, or pre-read work mail, humming along and well, ladiedahdiedahh.  There's still some serious shit going on and its been a pretty hectic past 8 months. But, I decide now. Not the cigarette. No more cravings or 'empty cigarette moments', and yet, prepared with a huge backpack full of knowledge and confidence might they return for some reason.    I remember people saying, be proud! And then I tried to be, but often didnt feel like it. I promiss you, that moment will come. Quitting is a super dynamic proces, ups, downs, left, right, hey I am ok, hell no I am not, hey I think Im there and oh shoot, id kill for a smoke right now... and so on. But time goes on, seasons change and you form new habits to challenge your addiction patterns and you learn new skills and you will get used to the new you.         I know I did! Its amaaazing!
Good for you MLMR!  You are so right how smoking dominates your life when you are a smoker.  I'm looking forward to being a happy non-smoker too.  But for now, I'm a quitter in hell week!  GrrrrrEdited May 7 by Mona
    I really love a cigarette right now , But i am not going out and buying it .    Health concerns are the only reason .

It seems so, so tiring!              That loss of control over my own life was my primary motivation to quit.  From the time I woke up in the morning to that last one before bed, cigarettes dominated my entire day.       It's good to think back on those not so pleasant memories from time-to-time.  A reminder to appreciate the quitting process.        Freedom...Get you some!
    Great post MLMR.  I also felt the same at one point.  It can and does become a thing of the past.  What a wonderful feeling to know that it no longer has a hold on you.
    Totally agree with your post MLMR, a good capture of your journey so far and how you have a strong grasp now.  I remember how the last few years of my smoking life that cigarettes had total control of my life and everything I did and planned (also had those mornings you mentioned -- never deal with me until a cup of coffee and a couple of cigarettes).  It is so much better now that the control of nicotine is no longer there.  Great job on your quit to this point!!!
    Great Post MLMR!  Not only are you changing what for years you never thought you could, but soon you feel the strength (that was always there) to change other things too.  When you reach the one year mark you should make time to re-read all of your early posts and the responses you were given.  Future you will be amazed at past you.
    Great post. I needed to read something like this today. Can't wait to get where you are. Thanks for sharing this. 
The Law of Addiction     Most quitting literature suggests that it normally takes multiple failed quitting attempts before the user self-discovers the key to success. What they fail to tell you is the lesson eventually learned, or that it can be learned and mastered during the very first try.    Successful recovery isn't about strength or weakness. It's about a mental disorder where by chance our dopamine pathway receptors have eight times greater attraction to a nicotine molecule than to the receptor's own neurotransmitter. We call it the "Law of Addiction" and it states:  "Administration of a drug to an addict will cause re-establishment of chemical dependence upon the addictive substance."    Roughly half of relapsing quitters report thinking that they thought they could get away with using just once. The benefit of fully accepting that we have a true chemical dependency and permanent priorities disorder can't be overstated. It greatly simplifies recovery's rules while helping protect against relapse.  Key to arresting our illness is obedience to one simple concept, that "one is too many and a thousand never enough." There was always only one rule, no nicotine just one hour, challenge and day at a time.    Navigating Withdrawal and Reclaiming Hijacked Dopamine PathwaysLike clockwork, constantly falling nicotine reserves soon had hostage dopamine pathways generating wanting for more. Sensing that "want" thousands of times per year, how could we not expect to equate quitting to starving ourselves to death?     Again, the essence of drug addiction is about dependency quickly burying all memory of our pre-dependency self. Thus, the first step in coming home and again meeting the real us is emptying the body of nicotine.     It's amazingly fast too. Cut by half every two hours, our mind and body become 100% nicotine-free within 72 hours of ending all use. Extraction complete, peak withdrawal now behind you, true healing can begin. While receptor sensitivities are quickly restored, down-regulation of the number of receptors to levels seen in never-users may take up to 21 days.   But within two to three weeks your now arrested dependency is no longer doing the talking. Quitting fears and dread are gradually thawing and melting into "like" or even "love." You're beginning to sense the truth about where you've been.  It's critical during early withdrawal to not skip meals, especially breakfast. Attempting to do so will likely cause blood sugar levels to plummet, making recovery far more challenging than need be. Why?     A stimulant, nicotine activates the body's fight or flight response, feeding the addict instant energy by pumping stored fats and sugars into the bloodstream. It allowed us to skip breakfast and/or lunch without experiencing low blood sugar symptoms such as feeling nervous or jittery, trembling, irritability, anxiousness, anger, confusion, difficulty thinking or an inability to concentrate. Minimize or avoid those symptoms. Eat little, healthy and often.  If your diet and health permit, drink some form of natural fruit juice for the first three days. Cranberry juice is excellent. It will aid in stabilizing blood sugar while accelerating removal of the alkaloid nicotine from your bloodstream.    Also, heavy caffeine users need to know that (as strange as this sounds), nicotine doubles the rate by which the liver eliminates caffeine from the bloodstream. One cup of coffee, tea or one cola may now feel like two. While most caffeine users can handle a doubling of intake, consider a modest reduction of up to one-half if feeling anxious, irritable or unable to sleep following caffeine use.    One caution. While we need not give-up any activity except nicotine use, use extreme caution with early alcohol use as it is associated with roughly 50% of all relapses.       The above is an excerpt from John Polito's article, "Nicotine Addiction 101". It explains the science behind why it is so darn difficult to quit nicotine and to stay quit.        The full article is here: Nicotine Addiction 101Edited May 4 by Aine
Last night, long after I should have been asleep, I paced a few times in my home, craving sugar. Craving a cigarette, actually, but I told myself a hit of sugar would fix the craving. I have no junk food.  I went to bed. Back up. I changed from my sleeping clothes to my street clothes, grabbed my purse and keys and headed for my car and the convenience store for cigarettes.        I'd been watching a Jordan Peterson lecture earlier. He said that life is painful, messy,, and chaotic, and that to avoid as much pain and suffering as possible, one has to have an aim, a worthwhile goal. It is not the attainment of the goal that is important, it is the working toward the goal or aim. Once you get there, you have to set another.         The point he made that stuck with me as I headed out the front door, was that any action that was not on the trajectory toward that worthwhile aim is a wrong action and guaranteed to cause pain.  I'd made myself a schematic with one line pointing toward the aim of a productive life, and another line slanting downward toward disease, misery, and shortened years. Peterson's words and the visual of the schematic overrode the urge to smoke, and I went back inside and went to bed.        Up again 15 minutes later, back in street clothes, going out to buy chocolate cake at the 24 hour grocery.  Peterson's words echoed again, and back to bed. Tried to relax and fall asleep, I flashed on having bought a fudge brownie mix on sale to have on hand in case I was struggling with nicotine cravings. A substitution serotonin-generator for smoking powerful enough to break through cravings. Back out of bed, baked the brownies as I watched more Jordan Peterson, ate a brownie. Now relaxed and craving for both smoking and sugar gone.        Awoke at 4:30 am at the insistence of my small dog, Sofia, who urgently wanted to go outside to pee and was hungry. Took her outside for a moment, gave her a small portion of her daily food, and crawled back to bed.     Dreamed that I had been forced to return to work at my previous employer's. It was a high-pressure, low-paid, dirty job, sorting donations in a thrift store. I succumbed to smoking, sneaking outside, afraid they'd smell the smoke and I'd be in trouble. Awoke to the sound of the chimes of my alarm clock, feeling heavy from lack of enough sleep and saddened that I'd lapsed.  The dream was so real, full color, the grass of the courtyard green, and I could feel the cold metal of the glass door frame as I tried to hold it open a crack as I smoked so that I could get back inside.  After waking, it took some seconds to separate the dream from reality and a few minutes to dispel the low feeling that I'd failed again. Cheerier now, and ready for a new day.           Peterson said in the same lecture,--citing Jung, I believe--that we are less in control of our behavior than we'd like to believe. After the trouble I've experienced staying quit, I feel the impact of his words. I believe it likely that I will lapse again because--in bipolar cycling--my perception of reality changes. Most of the time, I know the value of being quit. During the short but inevitable segment of despair that recurs every six weeks to three months, nihilism takes over and I become hostile to the nonsmoking voice in my head and take revenge by starting in again. I am hoping that I will gain enough wisdom from Peterson's lectures that maybe I can thwart self-destructive behavior and sustain a commitment.  And that vigorous exercise will uplift my mood.        Day at a time; craving at a time.
Thank you for this post Kate18, it was very helpful. I've had trouble staying quit as well. You should be proud of yourself for working through your cravings last night. Like you and everyone says...one day and even one minute at a time; one craving at a time.
        Quote               I believe it likely that I will lapse again because                 You've already started planning it?  You need to make yourself know that smoking is not an option anymore.  There are all sorts of other choices you can make, but smoking is no longer on the list.  It will get easier but it takes time.
    Kate, when you feel you're going to relapse PLEASE post here so that we can help you past it. It does work, it did for me and countless others. You owe yourself that much...………..
    Kate I love reading about your quit.        I haven't experienced bi-polar personally but someone very close to me has it so I have watched the changes they go through. It's not something you can plan for or avoid so I am sending you strength and good wishes x         
    Kate I too like your posts -- it is showing your journey in an honest way and that will come back to help you -- please keep posting as it will bring you a bit more confidence.  As to the dream, I too had a couple of those and like you I felt guilt upon waking and was so relieved when I realized it was a dream.  Keep strong and keep coming back to find more positive re-enforcement, you can do this, it is in you!!!!
    Cigarettes do nothing for us. They take away our time, our money and our health.        Seriously. They do nothing for you. I could understand if it was like weed and got you buzzed.  Or made you feel superhuman…    But no, they do nothing…    Absolutely nothing.  Go figure.
According to this ,     An average smoker inhales 1 to 2 milligrams of of nicotine per cigarette        A nicotine gum is a 4mg gum .       So that mean's eating a nicotine gum is equivalent to 2 cigarettes ?                I don't want to ingest 2 cigarette worth of nicotine gums every time i have an uncomfortable craving , even though i have been using it only once a week .              I didn't know that eating 1 gum was equivalent to 2 cigarettes .        So i am planning to throw away all the gums i have right now .
    Good for you redemption, you've got four months under your belt so that is the logical next step 
    Getting nicotine out of your body is the last step you will have to take to become truly free!
Want to know a secret...if I open my purse right now there will be 2 gums in there...just in case...I know I have them but not once since I stopped the gum have I even been tempted to have them. I think you are ready @Redemption3 to get rid of them for good. ... Look how far you have come...you should be super proud of yourself.
    Smoking cessation products are more about making companies rich and not so much about helping people quit smoking.  We have heard "I tried gums, patches, etc..."        I do think though more nicotine is absorbed in the mouth than through the lungs.   It seems to me then like nicotine gum would be more addictive than cigarettes.
    @jillar , reciprocity , notsmokinjo     Thanks a lot for the support .      @Jet Black ,        Eating these gums was becoming a habit , but i think it was way better than inhaling the smoke and ruining one's lungs   
    I agree I think it is time you get rid the gum, you are doing great now and from what you state you really are not using the gum much now.  Maybe the gum is just a crutch at this time-- time to let it go!!!!
The gum was a very useful tool for me when I quit.  I continued to carry a couple of pieces around with me for several months after I stopped chewing it (chewed it for 2-3 months), just in case I felt like I needed extra assistance in those still early stages of the quit.  In my experience, claims of long-term nicotine gum dependence are wildly exaggerated and ultimately unhelpful to the quitters who choose NRT as part of their recovery.  Also, scientifically speaking, inhaling burning cigarette smoke is a far more efficient delivery method of nicotine (and every other chemical) than chewing the gum.  It's not even close, so a piece of gum is not like two cigarettes.   It's not a bad idea to try to stop chewing entirely, but I wouldn't worry too much about it--you're doing great!      Christian99 Nearing 17 1/2 Years Quit
Thanks Martian5 , Christian99 .     I haven't touched NRT gums since 1/5/2019 .But i am feeling a bit too dull without any of these .       Too bored i guess . I am not sitting here doing nothing either , I have loads to study too for the next 4 more months , after that my degree course ends too .      So i am tired and excited too .     I am feeling a bit empty without any of these things , other than that i am feeling OK .        Its not cravings , Its just plain boredom
    Have you tried regular gum ...if it's just boredom ,this will keep your mouth busy ....
    Yes , I will try that       I want to try the  plainest gum out there without any special flavors

It's all very personal. Even though the methods used to quit are the same with slight variations depending on an individual's preference it all is a very personal thing. You always choose what works for you or just wing it. You do that on your own, always. Some plans I see I just cringe, but you know it usually ends up that it works for that person. A step-wise plan to quit is a good idea but doesn't need to be complex, and a fallback plan is even better. You can start by acting like a nonsmoker; see yourself a few weeks and a few months from now. What do you look like, what are you doing?Get to the reading and the writing. Post and become a part of this forum and pay it forward to cement your quit in your mind. You will do this on your own with a little help (minimal) assistance from your friends here. Nobody can quit for you, but you can learn how to stay quit here.Any or all of items 1-7 below, will make it better.(1) Commit to Not One Puff Ever (NOPE).(2) Commit to Never Take Another Puff (NTAP).(3) Educate yourself about your addiction. Read, post, learn, overcome. Lather, rinse, repeat.(4) Decide that you do not want to smoke more than you want to smoke. This may save you from relapse.(5) Take control of your life, reclaim your mind and body, and get it straight about who owns you. Is it you? Or your addiction?(6) Realize that you'll always be an addict, a puff away from a pack a day, but you choose not to smoke. That's all of us.(7) Start acting like a non smoker, like you never smoked, walk the walk. A cigarette is never the answer to anything but disease.( 8 Have a plan B if Plan A that you are using now fails. Make your plan B from steps 1-7, above.*(9) Celebrate your quit! Talk it up, be proud of what you have accomplished!Alright, enough with the steps and commitment to this and that already! Look at this logically if you will.  :) How else can you possibly quit smoking by any other means than stopping using cigarettes? The addiction to nicotine cannot be overcome by administering the same thing to yourself that you are addicted to, (nicotine).  What that means is when you are at 5 days, 7 days, 10 days, 28 days quit, and you find yourself craving a cigarette (your delivery device for nicotine), you cannot beat that crave/association with a cigarette. You might fix a bad hangover with some hair of the dog that bit you, but you can't fix a cigarette crave with a cigarette and still expect to quit smoking. Can you? Now go look at the items again, you have the desire.  What is missing if anything? You decide along the way, revamp the plan if you need to, adapt to your conditions, if something isn't working, get rid of it. Anything to keep the quit. You have to be fair to yourself, but firm. It will get better over time, but you'll only see it if you commit to it. And so you will. Welcome to a new life! :)
Thank you so much Markus! Reading - writing and posting has helped me a lot. I just went through some of my early notes and laughed. I sound like I don't know what I am doing....I really recommend it to everybody! It's like a free therapy session
great post Markus!  
Very good, and educational Markus....tks
Any lurkers out there - worried about quitting? Will you fail? Will you feel terrible? Don't worry! No you won't. Now you will feel fantastic! Jump in - read, post...it will save your life....
Brilliant post Markus I can imagine folk finding that very helpful.
Words of wisdom.  Thank you.  :)
Bringing this forward.. X
Bump..
I hadn't spotted this glad it was brought to the front line Thanks
I wonder where dear Markus is?  How is his quit?  I want to be babs and Nancy and MDQuitter, here supporting Newbs like me, celebrating my 3 yrs quit, yet never forgetting how close an addict is to a relapse and letting this community serve as my reminder. All whilst helping myself remain vigilant. Thank you to those of you on the lido deck and beyond for staying to help us newbies.
I think it's important to continue to pay it forward and keep the addict in us honest.  Somewhere on this board is a thread where you pledge to stay on here for one year minimum.  It really does make a difference.  NOPE every day for a year  =  super impactful.
It is on the main Discussion Board..second post down..sorry I'm not very savvy to link it here..
I forgot about this post. I am still around, my quit is good, going on 10 years. Wow, I feel old. I turned 60 this year. We have 8 grandchildren. Congrats to all of you doing the tough slogging, nothing worth having is easy! And it does get better...it just takes some time. I read a post on the Quit Train earlier.  One of the members forgot to think about smoking recently! She's won a battle, and is on the way to winning the war. I remember that feeling... Forgot to think about smoking...sweet, you just gotta love that/  :)
I just realized the other day that I no longer wake up each day thinking about smoking. That surprises me as that 1st one in the AM was always a focal point for getting the day started. Made me feel really good :)
Great to see you Markus..10 yrs..wow..inspirational..x
I went a whole day last week without thinking about smoking, you're right that was a great feeling.  It is getting easier and easier to push smoking out of my mind.
    Great post 
    It IS a great post Doreen - something all newbies can and should take to heart. Thanks for the bump.
    Agree, great. You can never forget what can happen again if we let it
    Gonna bump this up because it's good, encouraging information for our newbies (and I stalked on Markus when I saw him in celebrations  )    Thanks for giving back!

    It's not just a case of ..!!!!Oh well I'll try again.!!!!.....  I've seen people with good quits ,smoke one or two ...and just carnt get back to quitting for good ,and go back to smoking full blown . It can take years before ,they get in the right frame of mind to try again ...and still fail.....   The only reason a quit fails is because ,folks still believes the  cigarette offers you something...you still believes the lies......   This means you still haven't read and understood the nature of this killer addiction ...    If you carry on smoking ,your more than likely will contract a smoking related illness....some are irreversible......   If your here ...you have a quit .....all you need to do now ,is keep hold of it with everything you have ....   I live with someone who ,if they could would turn back the clock ,and do exactly this ...emphysema is something you don't want ....
A really good post .     The only reason a quit fails is because ,folks still believes the  cigarette offers you something      Thanks for that , Yes , It does not offer anything special .         Nun. By the pen and what they inscribe, (1) You are not, [O Muhammad], by the favor of your Lord, a madman.So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?         Maybe everything else , And it can be dealt with enough time and patience   The point of that is i think not to become self inflicted with some severe affliction , and then be mad about it for the rest of one's life .
    Sorry , A bit out of context . I was typing that for myself
    This is so on point.  We must have control at all times and never think that a cigarette can offer us some magic bullet that will help us thru something or offer positive re-enforcement.  Cigarettes offer nothing and only take away -- I have to remind self of this everyday and why I always go to the NOPE pledge.  Thanks Doreen for this post so that we can remember!!!!
Ok... I have a big failed quit in my past...and I'm talking more than half a decade... so listen up kidlets...1 smoke was all it took..just 1... And then for well over a decade I smoked like a chimney... Sure at the time, in the back of my head, I thought I'd have a couple here and there and quit again easy peasy, I mean I'd already done the quit think for nearly 7 years...NOPE...just as hard, if not harder this time around, and that's on me, because in the back of my mind all the time is the thought that I'm Gunna blow it again and my quit is just on borrowed time. Don't give yourself that whispering voice of self doubt. Don't get me wrong, this quit is it, not smoking ever again but just remember, however easy your quit feels you need to protect it because one smoke really can switch all those nicotine receptors back on in one moment.        Just because you have a failed quit doesn't mean you can't have a successful one. QUIT in Aus tells us that the average is 6 serious quit attempts before you have your forever quit. That is the average, some only need the 1 attempt, some need 20.....whatever your number is you do have one so never give up giving up.       In the same vein don't belittle a failure by calling it a slip, just as you own your successes you need to account for your failures. You smoked, you reset your quit... There are only three questions to answer when you fail:        1. When will I quit again?  2. What were the triggers?  3. What did I learn?
    Thanks Doreen for this great post and reminder how romancing that cigarette leads to danger. I have been rewarding myself and am so amazed how much I have deprived myself by putting so much money in poisoning myself. I have a long way to go but these little rewards are adding up and keeping me motivated. 
As addicts we are all 1 puff away from a pack a day! Once you have put in the hard work to establish your quit it becomes an easy matter of daily maintenance.  Complacency and your addiction whispering however softly in your ear are our enemies. Forever vigilant folks. Edited May 1 by reciprocity

That is the average, some only need the 1 attempt, some need 20.....whatever your number is you do have one so never give up giving up.               When "average" makes it's way into statistics, it offers only discouragement I think. If someone has tried once or twice, there would be that lingering thought, "I still have to try 5 more times..." I remember before my Oct 2017 quit, I had read and heard how nicotine is harder to quit than meth, crack, heroine, glue, Oxycontin, and porn combined. Of course seeing on TV over the years how they portrayed someone quitting any of those, they were flopping around like a fish and screaming.  It makes one think, "what is it gonna be like to quit nicotine?" Not as bad as big pharm would have us think (they gotta sell gum and patches somehow)              7 hours ago, notsmokinjo said:              In the same vein don't belittle a failure by calling it a slip, just as you own your successes you need to account for your failures. You smoked, you reset your quit... There are only three questions to answer when you fail:                                        1. When will I quit again?                  2. What were the triggers?                  3. What did I learn?                One week ago I bought a pack and over the next three days, I smoked six cigarettes. Saturday in the real early AM (like 2:00'ish?) I gave the pack to my room mate and had her crumble the rest. So what do I call those six? A relapse? Slip? Complete and utter disgraceful failure to mankind?       1) I quit after three days. The smoking experience was pretty nasty and I just haven't wanted it since. 2) I have no clue what the trigger was. Usually when I get a crave is when I get real happy or excited. Me and a couple acquaintances have this running joke about Nipsy Hustle's passing, maybe that did it.   3) I learned that smoking is nasty, well, was reminded. I try not to learn new things sine my brain is mostly filled to capacity at this point.

The term "slip" minimizes what has taken place. By taking even 1 puff you have awakened your addiction and given it strength that your hard work over a year and a bit had taken away. I'm sure you are feeling that over these past few days - urges to have "just one more" are no doubt stronger than they have been in months. Statements such as "Complete and utter disgraceful failure to mankind" are simply childish - grow up!         I'm glad you have reaffirmed to yourself that smoking is nasty. That's something positive. I would be concerned about not knowing the trigger that lead you to make the decision to have that first smoke and YES, that was a conscious decision YOU made - no one else. If it was just "a slip" then why did you have 6 cigarettes over 3 days? Why not just the first one, or maybe two?      You have talked a lot over your time here about not wanting to fall victim to some horrible smoking related disease. There's only 1 positive thing you can do to try and avoid that outcome and that is to take quitting seriously. If you don't learn something very significant from this episode then you are bound to repeat it next time something unusual happens.    Remember; it was you that said: " I have no clue what the trigger was."
You know, I am thinking it was probably a bad idea to post about my little relapse. It seems you and a few others here have attacked and blown things out of proportion, like you are glad it happened. Like, "alright! an opportunity to pounce!" Funny thing is, there are three people on here who I would have expected backlash from but were either very polite or said nothing. All three of them I have not been nice to in the past and feel worse about that than anything.   Also -  I smoked 15 years and had quit long before anything crippling happened.     So if 6 cigarettes over 3 days is a "full blown 5 alarm relapse" then what exactly is it when someone quickly relapses to a pack (or more) a day and stays smoking for months or years. For those (except Doreen) who ARE acting like it is your place to decide what I do, exactly why are you so upset about my small relapse? Are you assuming I am sitting here smoking right now or something?
    Where all hear to help ...folks just say it different ....  I have  only seen honest posts ...tryjng to help you and others ,trying to stop further relapses... This is your quit JB .....  Quitting is all about honesty ....it's a addiction ...addicts have to be upfront ...it no use keeping secrets ...if you want honest support back ...    It's sad to see a soldier go down ....it means a battle has been lost ....this also means the war is lost too....   If the board gave you a gentle pat  on the back and said  it doesn't,t matter....what message would this be giving out

A nicotine addiction is more than just physical and psychological it has a huge routine aspect to it...you have patterns to you addiction, habits often years old, because to a certain degree smoking is still socially acceptable (it's not against the law)...because it is easy to feed the habit (don't need to break any laws to get a fix)..because it is so ingrained into the rituals that make up our daily lives that is what makes it so hard to quit, you don't just need to detox you need to reprogram. From my person experience, detox from nicotine was easier than alcohol or speed/cocaine but it was not easier to quit as an addiction.
    If JB wants to think of this as a slip or a little relapse that’s her prerogative. On the flip side, people here are entitled to express their belief that you can never have just one.  Those holding that opinion are not personally attacking you - they just feel strongly about how best to defeat this deadly addiction.  Best wishes moving forward JB.   
Back in the day I was very passionate about quitting smoking. There were so many benefits, expected and unexpected, that I wanted every single smoker to break free and feel amazing. I hated cigarettes and what they do to us. I guess it was my passion that has kept me quit for the last 5 years so it can't be a bad thing, right? But oh my. When ever I saw a thread about yet another quitters relapse I had steam coming out my ears. I'd post the brutal truth especially when the relapser had little insight nor had taken any responsibility for their relapse because I knew they were probably never going to keep their quit. And that made me sad for them and for others in the early quit because it would have been scary for them to read how 'easy' it was to relapse. And it almost made a mockery of those that worked their butts off protecting their quit. As if a 'little relapse' was nothing to get your knickers in a knot about. Righto ...        5 years on and I have learned you can't fix other peoples addictions and you can't blame others for their brain wiring. If you have the energy and patience to sooth a relapser then that's wonderful. Everyone deserves support. Even the ones that don't post SOS's. But remember, your time and energy should be focused on YOU and YOUR quit. That's where your passion should be directed towards.
    Thank you Doreensfree for this post!    It and all the responses have helped me more than you know to get immediately back on the right track and take my seat on the Train.

Second, I could care less about "Fanfare". I imagine those who got the most upset and talked crap probably used other NRT stuff after their so-called "quits".  Yeah I talk a lot of crap but I do not personally attack people who relapse.    Funny how I am no where close to being part of the in-crowd of this board yet a few took interest when I posted about a relapse.        And "a" hot dog? Just one? I would be picking up probably three or four. But then I am no vegan.

You are an active member of our community, you are a regular, you have polarising opinions which you readily share and defend (not saying they are wrong just saying not everyone agrees), you are very much a known presence. As a whole we might not always agree with each other, or get each other or even particularly like each other but that doesn't mean the things we each say and do don't impact and leave an impression on others... That goes for all of us.        JB, in all honesty you and I are poles apart on many things and yet had I posted that I'd smoked instead of you l'm pretty sure the reactions would have been the same, it's a shock thing.
Let's get a good discussion going here for the holidays because as another new year is upon us, so are thousands wanting to rid their lives of this crippling and deadly addiction.  We may keep this group discussion going until the end of the year so we get a large sampling of fears, experiences and why these fears are not rooted in fact and instead nicotine (drug) addiction. Many smokers are afraid to quit for various reasons.  There is nothing to fear about quitting but everything to fear about not quitting.  Then there are those who are new to smoking who have irrational fears about staying quit, fear of relapse, fear of failure and even the fear of succeeding. What fears did you have before you made the commitment to N.O.P.E. (not one puff, ever), what did you do to overcome those fears and how do you view those fears today? Once you actually quit smoking, did you have any fears about relapsing and if so, how did you get past them and do those fears still exist? Here a couple of videos for reference, especially for our guests who may be having some fears that are stopping them from making a commitment to N.O.P.E. The Fear Of FailureThis video explains how many people are fearful of even attempting a quit because they are convinced that it is impossible for them to succeed. The attached videos examine the reasons for this fear and will help to illustrate that smokers can quit if they understand the addiction they are fighting and how to take control of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_64RhiVj9Y&list=PLCDB8BA311D538113&index=8 The Fear Of SuccessThis video explains how many people are fearful of attempting a quit because they realize that they may actually succeed. The attached videos examine the reasons for this fear and will help smokers to understand that the fears they have of their lives being ruined are based on the false assumption that cigarettes were helping them to live as opposed to recognizing that smoking was ruining their lives in many ways. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHhWSOsWoBE&list=PLCDB8BA311D538113&index=9 The Fear Of RelapsingVideo explains how many people are fearful of even attempting a quit because they are convinced that even if by some miracle they succeed, they will likely lose the quit at some future point in time. This video explains why they may have this fear and what resources we have to deal with it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoWuSG8W_2E Quitting Smoking Out Of FearVideo explains how quitting smoking simply out of fear of it's consequences has its limitations and may make staying off harder than it should be. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpre2NagvY
I was worried that I couldn't quit. I never really tried before. I was also worried that I'd always crave and think about cigarettes. I'm only 5 months in and so far neither is true.  I was also worried that id be bored without them but I find things to do without really trying.  I was also worried about handling emotions without them. This fear took a little longer to over come but I find even if my mind does wander to the thought of smoking, it's a lot easier than I thought to dismiss.  For me, finally getting the guts to Atleast try to quit Got the ball rolling. Then I dealt with each fear as they arose.  Am I afraid of replaspe? I was very early on but since I figured out there are no emotions, events or circumstances besides myself choosing to light and smoke one that can make me relapse I no longer fear it.
For me, I had been a smoker for twice as long as I had been a non smoker. Smoking was part of everything that I did. How could I possibly quit for EVER? I didn't. I just quit for a day.  Then I quit for another. Now, every day, I pledge to take Not One Puff Ever, Just for Today...
Whenever I imagined myself as a non-smoker, I believed that I would be missing out on good times made even better because of smoking.  Going out wouldn't be as enjoyable without cigarettes and the ordinary tasks of daily life would become bland.  The big one for me was smoking while drinking my morning coffee.  I would seriously look forward to going to bed at night because I knew I would soon be drinking coffee and smoking half a dozen cigarettes while my mind and body sparked back to life.  As it turned out, I didn't miss those mornings once I quit and much to my surprise, I enjoyed my mornings much more without smoke in my eyes, the stench on my clean clothes and hair I didn't have to go outside or in the garage and sit on a stool.  I remembered reading about how many people are found dead with a cigarette next to them.  I often thought about that while smoking in the garage and wondered if it would be me. These are just a few of fears/lies that I believed for so long.  More to follow... 1.  I never missed out on anything once I quit.
Quitting always made me so afraid,  scared I would miss the nicotine, miss the cigarette, what would I do without it, I could never see further than that, even the thought of dying from lung cancer, heart failure even those thoughts did not make me want to quit.  I stated smoking at 12 to be part of the gang, thought it made me look cool, I couldnt smell the smoke from me, but I started to feel the effects, the tightening of the chest, the lines deepening of my face, being out of breath walking up the stairs, I started thinking, what if I could be braver than the addiction, what If I could face the addiction head on, I need a little medical intervention to stop my brain from wanting cigarettes, but again so far so good, I have been thinking about cigarettes alot recently, but I keep telling myself, be stronger than the addiction, be braver, don't be afraid of your quit, its making you a healthier, stronger person.  Positive thoughts do go a long way, nicotine addiction is negative thought,
II used to fail because I thought nicotine was a lifeline I couldn't do without so as soo as I got off patches I relapsed. This time will be different. I might post a view SOS's but I rather do that then going back to smoking. I know this point is a dangerous one. I need to get through. STICK to NOPE but it's a really point where I'm gonna be tested, Even now when I'm one step down with patches I'm getting thouhts of smoking. 
I think all smokers at some time or another have/had a fear of quitting.  I feared it for a long long time because I found many excuses to not face it.  I can't quit now because I definitely cannot afford to gain weight; I can't quit now because I have too much stress in my life right now; I can't quit now because I can't afford to feel sick and take time off from work; I can't quit now for....the list can go on and on.  When I was told that diabetic retinopathy was slightly beginning in my eyes and I googled everything I could on how to prevent the escalation of it, everything I read, first thing listed QUIT SMOKING - DON'T SMOKE - STAY AWAY FROM SMOKING.  I was more fearful of going blind than quitting cigarettes, so I made a date and I quit on that day, and I've not looked back.  I still get strong cravings or urges to smoke a cigarette, and every now and then still have dreams of smoking, but when someone who just had a cigarette comes near me and I smell it on them, it disgusts me now just to think that is what I smelled like.  And I probably smelled worse because I smoked at least a pack a day; sometimes slightly more.  It also made me feel terrible; I can see that now since I don't feel like that anymore.  When an individual quits smoking, it is a unique personal journey, and you must be ready in your heart and mind to be successful.  I think before I quit I was actually afraid of relapse, but once I actually quit, it didn't bother me.  Again, I think because I made a plan and stuck to that plan and a date, I had time to lead up to it and prepare myself for what was coming.  I can honestly say that if I can quit smoking, anyone can quit.  I was extremely addicted to my cigarettes, and couldn't imagine my life without smoking.  Now I look back and can't imagine my life as a smoker ever again.
Fear is one of our worse enemies I feel and I think as some get older fear is worse as it creates whole scenarios of why not to do something  When we were kids we were mostly fearless, nervous at Times yes but pretty fearless, we would give things a try Ride a bicycle until the stabilizers came off and we would be  freewheeling downhill Learn to drive until the learner L plates came off Climb a tree one branch at at a time and eventually reach the top The thing is when younger fear was not really an issue or could even have been a motivator? I think regardless we took steps then until we mastered skills and look what fun we had riding  bikes, driving those cars and climbing those trees  Sure I got a few bumps and bruises but the reward at the end was all worth it Taking a chance to see what's on the other side of that fear that's how I quit smoking  realizing fear was what held me back for so many years was half the battle, the rest as they say is history, education, support and determination was the  other half of the battle One that anyone could win!
what if I fail? Well, if you try to quit and then relapse...you are back where you would be anyway. No loss. It is the 21st century. We can no longer pretend in the modern world that we do not understand the dangers of smoking. There is no rational reason to continue smoking. I feared failing. I had failed before.  But actually, there is nothing to fear. No one is forcing me to quit. I choose to smoke or not to smoke. So, if I make a choice to smoke, it is a choice, not a failure. So, no fear.  I have made a choice not to smoke. Just for today.  There is nothing to fear.  Why not choose not to smoke today? It's not as tough as you might think.
I agree with you all and, looking back, it is ridiculous! How can a fear of failure stop me from even trying?! But it did, so many times... I was also afraid of being bored - smoking stopped me being bored (yeah, right). I also thought that smoking helped control my stress levels (again, lol at that). So I think that once I figured out that these were all lies that I was telling myself, to enable me to carry on smoking without feeling guilty (how can I feel guilty, I'm an ADDICT?), that was a real turning point. To keep quit, I always took it a day at a time. And I took strength from others that had quits similar or longer than me - I looked up to them. But I also took strength (and this is horrible to say) from people who relapsed - I saws people who had been quit longer than I had, giving in and smoking. And I saw these same people fail again, and again... I saw how difficult it was for people to quit again after a relapse, and I was not going to be that person, no way! This place and my friends gave me the strength to keep the quit in times of need, and I hope to repay the favour whenever necessary.
I'm a Life long smoker...52  years....i thought I would probably die a smoker.... Fear kept me from even imagining I could have a life with out my crutch...I couldn't possibly live with out them.....could I.....Oh yes I can...I can have the best life I could ever imagine....Early in my quit ..I was told by the old timers ...stay strong ....the magic will happen....It sure does....Being a part of this group has been the most wonderful time of my life....I now live my life living with a daily n.o.pe...And I've never been happier....
When I was younger I didn't see anything wrong with smoking.  Why quit as I enjoyed them!  I also thought they were a stress reliever!  As more and more things were blamed on them, my children begged me to quit as they got the facts at school.  By then I was very afraid to even try to quit as I just knew I couldn't do it.  Years later I decided I really wanted to quit.  I think that is the key - really wanting to quit.  I put my last one out in the evening and the next morning made it several hours without one and knew I pretty well had it licked at that point.  I was one that as soon as my feet hit the floor I was out the back door for a smoke.  I won't say it was the easiest thing I have done but it sure was a lot easier than I expected.  I still get an urge ever so often but it just last for a second.  All you have to do is NOPE!!!

    Bump for newbies !!!
I wrote this on another forum today, but I thought it worth re-writing here, mostly because this is the biggest lesson I needed to learn to finally make my quit stick. I may need to re-read it in the days to come...     I hear a lot of people say that stress caused them to return to smoking. I get it. I used that reasoning in the past, too. But it was just an excuse to feed my addiction. I see that now.      If you think there will ever be an easy, stress-free time to quit, you are wrong. While we may experience periods of low stress, life will always throw curveballs at us. Illness happens. Death happens. Jobs are lost. New jobs are begun. Relationships hit the rocks. We move. We travel. We work. We live.     Life can be hard. But it's no excuse to start smoking again.        Believe me, I understand stress. I suffer from severe bipolar disorder. I was recently diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease that can affect the heart and lungs. (I saw a cardiologist for the first time yesterday.) I am currently watching my dearest friend die from acute liver failure. (It's an extremely ugly way to go. She's suffering horribly. She's only 41 years old.)        I'm living through one of the most stressful periods in my life. And I'm doing it smoke free. I chose to quit during a stressful period, because I needed to learn that stress is no excuse to smoke. And right now, each day that I remain smoke free, I am solidifying this truth in my mind.     I am freeing myself. Finally. It's been an uphill climb, but every single step has been worth it.       Don't wait to quit. And don't give yourself an excuse to start again.       Smoking won't eliminate stress from our lives. It just won't. And it won't help us cope, either. Once we learn that, we are truly free.Edited March 5 by abbynormal

Feb 10th i should've been 9 years free but on 9/24/12 i got stress/bad news lost direction and in fact i did feed the addiction by saying/doing the F-IT .. Its our crutch and a miserable cycle.

    Thank you Abby for such an honest and open post. I'm sure you sharing this will help many more to come. You are doing great and should be so proud of yourself. And again, I'm really sorry about your friend 
    Thank you for sharing Abby....I'm sure it will help lots of folks ....The first thing we did ,when we faced stress was reach for our crutch ... We believed it helped us cope better ....it was in truth the exact opposite.....    You have come along way and got over that big hurdle ...    My thoughts to you and your your friend ......
    Thank you Abby for your post.   I am so sorry for your friend.  Smoking did nothing for us. NOTHING.    Dealing with stress in a clear and clean way is the way forward and much easier without the stress of addiction.
    You're right Abby. We all have stress at some point during our quits so using stress as a reason to start smoking again is just an excuse. I used smoking to avoid dealing with the life issues that caused the stress. Smoking never reduced that stress - just allowed me to avoid dealing with life for a while. Once you've truly realized that smoking does not relieve stress, you have made a huge leap forward to achieving life long freedom from this addiction.
    On point Abby, on point.  Stress is there and will always be there but it is not an excuse for smoking -- that will only make things worse.  For the last two months I have gone thru some very stressful times from a death in the family, health issues, and housing issues (as well as some very strange family issues) and let me tell you I almost used the stress from all that to pick up a smoke again.  With grace I realized that smoking would not solve the stress -- not even make it feel a little bit better, so after a little more than a year quit I think I realized that even though I have to remain vigilant I believe I now have the upper hand in this quitting thing.  During the quit process we have to remember that curve balls are going to thrown at us!!!!
    Wow, Abby. Now you know that there is nothing you can't do because you've had so much thrown at you at once and are managing to get through it gracefully, no matter how painful it may be at times.  Thank you for your post which may very well help put things in perspective for someone who is struggling with starting or maintaining a quit; and thank you for being there for your friend when she needs you the most.  I wish you the very best with getting your health issues under control, and have no doubt that cigarettes no longer stand a chance against you.  
    I'm in awe of you. I can't even handle stress regardless of smoking or not.         Sounds like you have got this well and truly figured out and will never smoke again.

We believed it helped us cope better ....it was in truth the exact opposite.....                                    Usually when I was stressed I reached for a cigarette.      OK sorry bad joke I am out.

I may need to re-read it in the days to come...                                     I hear a lot of people say that stress caused them to return to smoking. I get it. I used that reasoning in the past, too. But it was just an excuse to feed my addiction. I see that now.                                      If you think there will ever be an easy, stress-free time to quit, you are wrong. While we may experience periods of low stress, life will always throw curveballs at us. Illness happens. Death happens. Jobs are lost. New jobs are begun. Relationships hit the rocks. We move. We travel. We work. We live.                                     Life can be hard. But it's no excuse to start smoking again.                                        Believe me, I understand stress. I suffer from severe bipolar disorder. I was recently diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease that can affect the heart and lungs. (I saw a cardiologist for the first time yesterday.) I am currently watching my dearest friend die from acute liver failure. (It's an extremely ugly way to go. She's suffering horribly. She's only 41 years old.)                                        I'm living through one of the most stressful periods in my life. And I'm doing it smoke free. I chose to quit during a stressful period, because I needed to learn that stress is no excuse to smoke. And right now, each day that I remain smoke free, I am solidifying this truth in my mind.                                     I am freeing myself. Finally. It's been an uphill climb, but every single step has been worth it.                                       Don't wait to quit. And don't give yourself an excuse to start again.                                       Smoking won't eliminate stress from our lives. It just won't. And it won't help us cope, either. Once we learn that, we are truly free.                 This is such a great post,Abby.  We are lucky you are sharing your quit with us.

    I want to thank you ALL for the positive thoughts and prayers for my friend. I'm a little late in doing so, and I apologize for that. But each one of you who offered your kind words did much to soothe my sad heart. ❤

    Thank you abbynormal for this post. I had noted it in my journal (this was before I joined the forum) because I'm not good at dealing with stress and that was always my excuse for smoking again. You've proven no matter what, stress can be handled without smoking. I will keep coming back to this thread.         I'm sorry about your friend and the difficult health issues you continue to face yourself. But you can be proud you're doing it without smoking and that you're helping more people than you realize by sharing your quit story.         
Yesterday had dr appt. Blood pressure was 140/90, up from 120/60 three months ago, up from my normal 112/62.   I felt a knot of fear in my stomach when she told me.        According to the American Stroke Association, that is stage 2 hypertension and in stroke range. (Other organizations have their own ideas of how they define stages.)       Later in the day my 5 year old granddaughter came over. We went to the park and I taught her how to fly a kite.  I thought to myself, "it is unthinkable to keep smoking when it could kill me or cause a stroke, and rob my granddaughter of having her grandmother in her life."      I don't know why I have such trouble staying quit. It's possible that it's affected by being bipolar and going from elation to despair in cycles. Terrible lack of self-discipline and poor impulse control. I told the psychiatrist who monitors my meds that I want to start meeting with her to learn how to strengthen  impulse control and stop this destructive way of being. I want a productive life, not just existence with smoking-caused diseases as my future.     I'm glad the QT is here, online, and I apologize for the lack of commitment and follow through. Truly, I am trying to get this right.
    Sorry you are having additional health issues but at least it has kept you aware of your nicotine addiction and the fact that you really need to tackle that to give yourself the best chance for better health in your future. I'm glad you are seeking help from your medical people. I'm sure your bipolar issue adds a significant complication to the quit process. I wish you the very best in getting some direction from your Dr. on that. Quitting really will be a huge step forward to a better future for you.
    Hey Kate sorry to hear about this.  Work with your doctor on your BP, they can really help with that.  For years my doctor was trying to get me to quit due to blood work and high BP.  Finally I had a sit down with her and my nurse and they were blunt and realistic -- I took it from there and hear I am now.  I will always have to take BP meds but since I have quit and changed some of my other lifestyles my BP is well controlled and a reduction in meds has happened.  I can relate about your granddaughter, I came to the same realization about my grandson since we are so close.  You have some good reasons for sticking with your quit at this time and as you improve use that as your motivation.  Welcome back and come back often -- you can get it right this time!!!!!
    Glad you're back to quitting Kate while your blood pressure is still in an easily manageable place. Hopefully that's the motivation you finally need to conquer this addiction. Stay close and reach out when you feel yourself caving to a crave. You owe that to yourself and who knows maybe these fine people can help you past it and you will save your quit  
Thanks to both of you, Martian5 and Reciprocity. I made myself a poster this morning and posted it prominently on my refrigerator. I feel a bit foolish sharing it, but what the heck.  The "Daily Dozen" at the bottom of the page refers to Dr. Michael Greger's Daily Dozen free app to keep track of his recommended foods each day.        After getting the news about my eyes a few weeks ago (mild cataracts and early-stage glaucoma), and now the rise in blood pressure, I am back to a whole plant foods diet that I began a few months ago. I found Greger while searching around Youtube for videos of Rip Esselstyn and the whole foods diet he promotes. Both Greger's and Esselstyn's stories are interesting, as are the results they say are achieved by ditching animal and processed foods, such as normalizing blood pressure, reversing heart disease, returning to a healthy weight, etc. Both back their recommendations on clinical evidence reported in thousands of articles published in peer-reviewed medical journals.       We'll see. My blood pressure is too high, I am now 21 lb overweight since changing to a sedentary job last year, and I am in a fight to protect my vision.  Smoking does not solve any of those problems. Never has, never will, and I'll keep drilling that point into my thick skull until it's anchored for good.     High blood pressure april 29 2019.pdf
    Kate, whishing you all the best from The rainy Netherlands. I admire you for researching your health/food, putting the poster on your fridge (I did the same with a letter, but for a different reason). My mental health is improving and I am really starting to experience a new calm. I believe quitting makes the mess in my head easier to bear, proof is piling up especially for the last couple of weeks. I whish the same for you and I know you can do this, despite everything. I bet you are a strong person.       Hang in there!
    Kate thanks for posting your "refrigerator" information, I am going to look that information up to see if it will help me.  Looks like you are establishing a good plan!!!!
    I'm sorry to hear about your blood pressure, Kate, but I am glad you are back at quitting smoking.  Going smoke free should really help your BP and many other aspects of your health.      Stick close and reach out if you need help.  Quitting for good would be the best thing you can possibly do at this point.
Eight months done and dusted. Its been 25°C for some days now, probably too hot for this time of the year. I am so happy that it doesnt affect me at all: it means I did a good job dealing with these craves last summer, when I quit. In terms of seasonal triggers, I think I am safe to say Ive had the worst. Pretty uplifting idea!   Time is starting to speed up. I dont know how to describe it, but thoughts of smoking are turning into soft whispers in the background and the days that I hardly think about it are adding up. Its facinating, because I know Ive been working towards this and yet it strikes me as, well, relief? That it really was true, what everyone here said? And that it also works for me..? Working on it, fighting for it, studying on it, all that hard work is starting to really, really pay off now. More and more I am able to let go of holding on to quitting, if that makes sense. Ofcourse I could make a giant list of pro's, but right now these are the most important:    * I saved money for more than half a piano (hence the picture). * I save and still have extra money to spend in daily life, which makes me feel more independant.   * I feel so much better physicaly, its shocking.    * I take care of myself way better. What started as time biding and routine changing, became daily rituals: making ginger tea instead of coffee in the morning, tooth picking/brushing 3 times a day and discovering all sorts of new toothpaste, deep breathing (only managed to do that since i was at 6+ months. So glad I kept trying, its brilliant) and last but not least: slowing down when I am tired, mourning when I experience loss and need to proces and cheering myself up when I know thats what I gotta do (I used to be the person to sít in my sadness, put on Nick Drake and drown myself in it).   I really hope this helps you, if youre struggeling at the moment. Things will be better. Every day, even every minute is part of the bigger story. You WILL feel good again, you WILL feel proud eventually and you are doing this for a reason. Cling to it, write it down. Do what you need to, when you need to do it and know that there is never ever a genuine reason why you could not become a nonsmoker.    Edited April 24 by MLMR
All I can say is good for you, sticking to it and reaping the benefits.  You put into words what I felt last fall as I had completed my 8th month.  It sneaks up on you but then it hits you hard that this is doable.  Job well done and thanks for the post - it really shows that not only can it be done but it is so well worth it!!!!!!
    Love this post @MLMR......  Don't look now !!!!!.....The magic is happening ....It was lovely to read ....x  
    MLMR you have such an amazing way with words.  I feel the same but just could not find the words to express my feelings. I know smoking is a thing of my past and will never again be a part of my future.      I feel like a different person.  A healthier person.    That piano looks awesome.  Keep saving those pennies.
    This post just makes my day. I really hope you copy it into your other post so that people following your journey see the end result.        
    Love this post MLMR, so glad you're doing so well now. I have no doubt that this post will help many people know that they too can be successful

    I love when this happens for people; happened to me at about eight months as well.  I gained a stronger sense of empathy and understanding at this point of ending my nicotine addiction.
    It's posts like this that make me realize I can do this! I need to simply put my head down and keep marching...(someone posted something like this?)

    Great post MLMR, well written.
    This post is great. Can’t wait to get to this stage. Congratulations and thanks !!!
    I have read here somewhere that after quitting it's possible that meds for high blood pressure may be lowered or eliminated. I think it was Martian who had his meds lowered. I do have a doctors appt in May and will have my bp checked and discuss this with my doctor then but has anyone else here experienced lower bp after quitting?  How long after quitting does this usually happen?  Would love to eventually not have to take them. 
Did not happen in my case...actually blood pressure med was upped a bit after CABGx3 bypass surgery last year due to my coronary artery disease.
I think mine dropped a little but nothing significant.  I believe mine is now typically 140/90 and probably 145/90 when I smoked. Not sure exactly but it wasn't much.      I think raised blood pressure is a short term effect of smoking. Depending on the source, it takes between 20 minutes and 24 hours for BP to drop.      Of course they keep lowering the number of what is "safe" so they can sell more BP meds. That part has nothing to do with smoking and more about them pushing meds.
    Yes it was I whose BP dropped.  My doctor stated that quitting smoking was a big part in that.  My BP had gone to the low side so we lowered the meds.  Also my walking had improved and that will also help lower BP  Now remember everyone is different.  I would continue to monitor your BP and then discuss with your doctor (of course they will also probably add that exercise and diet will also help -- but hey I did that also).
    My blood pressure didn't get lower either. But I'm not as active as I should be because of my asthma. 
    Thanks everyone. Martian I too have started to be more active and am trying to eat healthier. Going to the gym now and these things help. I will keep an eye on bp and talk to Dr when I see him next month. 
    I know I've been pretty quiet lately. I'm still here! My quit is still very much intact. I've been lurking but not posting much. I'm going through some very overwhelming health stuff, and my mind is on overload.     The thought of smoking popped into my mind briefly a couple of days ago. I dismissed that thought immediately. My autoimmune disease is affecting my lungs, and the thought of breathing in anything other than clean air is repugnant to me now. But the stress...the stress is the trigger. Thank goodness I am strong enough to say "NO!" when the Nicodemon whispers in my ear. Even with all I am going through, I can still say no to smoking.        You can, too. I promise.
    So happy to hear from you Abby. Sounds like your dealing with difficult health issues.  Know that I am praying for you.     You definitely want to hang onto that quit.  Smoking would probably make your lung issues worse.  Please keep us up on everything.  We care!
    I'm sorry to hear about your struggles, Abby, but am glad you are keeping your quit.  Stay strong, Abby.  We really care for you.
    Great to hear from you Abby.  Sorry about the health issues, I know the stress that can add to your life.  It looks like you have the right attitude and are keeping strong.  Prayers are with you!!!

    Good to hear from you Abby, I sure hope the pulmonologist will be able to do something to help you. I know how it feels to not be able to breath  I'm thinking positive thoughts for you, xoxoImagine how much harder it would be if you hadn't made the decision to quit 
    Your quit family here cares about you Abby and it saddens us to hear you are dealing with the health struggles you are having to deal with but you have done the most important thing you could possible do in terms of your lung function by quitting smoking. Stay strong and let us know how things are going.
    Glad you are still here, Abby! Yes, the health issues can be overwhelming at times (don't I know it!)... but remember that your quit has made you stronger than ever!   Stay positive...
    Thanks to everyone here, this is were you belong. This is the best support group and if you stick around you will succeed. 
A few things really caused me to quit. One being the fact that I could not laugh like a jack-ass when I found something comical. I would try to laugh and end up nearly choking.    I would try to sleep but had to cough a certain way so my breath would quit rattling. I got pissed off at the cigarettes.   But yeah, when I realized I was getting better, it was the first night in 15 years I fell asleep with NO rattle noises. It was also when I could laugh loud and obnoxiously again without coughing.     You know thing that isn't discussed much but when I did smoke, I felt pretty guilty. I would buy something nice, maybe a new outfit, or whatever. The thought I often had was, "How long til cigarette smoke ruins this?"
When the stains faded from my fingers and my toes looked normal again.  My toes were bright red year-round.  I always though it was because of severe frostbite that I suffered as a teenager.  That was not the case.  Smoking effected my blood circulation.  After a few weeks off of the cigarettes, my toes were normal skin color.  And a lot warmer too!Edited April 22 by Pearlie
I had a lung test performed at the doctor when he prescribed my Chantix (I was still smoking at the time) and the results were pathetic.        Not wheezing when going to bed and not having to clear my throat all the time after a few days was cool, but the real eye opener was when I went back to the Dr. six (smoke free) weeks later, my lung capacity was somewhere around, 200% better.       Edited April 22 by JimHannoonen
When I could walk up the hill from the lake, 200yards, without huffing and puffing. Also when I stopped coughing all, night, long.      P.S. Hey Jim!    Edited April 22 by NOPEster
    Back in the fall when I could smell autumn in the air and could walk more than a mile, then the Doctor saying I had to reduce some of my blood pressure medications since it was going to low -- that was the mark!!!!
I’ve gone almost 3 years without getting those painful skin cracks on the tips of my fingers, plus my toes aren’t always freezing in winter.   I think I could walk barefoot in the snow nowEdited April 22 by Wayne045
    When I stopped coughing my lungs up. This recovery happened so fast, within a week.
    Within two weeks ,that awful painful dull sore ache had gone from both ankles ..I had stopped scratching them to ease the pain ...
My constant coughing stopped after about a week...the terrible phlegm production after two weeks...and the problems with my eyes cleared up almost immediately and they were no longer bloodshot....God, I didn't realize what a mess I was! My messed up arteries took surgery to clear up and I have been dealing with that issue since the day I quit!       PS Just had my one year anniversary last week since my CABGx3 surgery...got the thumbs up from cardiologist...echo normal, ekg normal, blood-work normal. What a relief...I can get back to my gardening with no restrictions!

    That's great news @Rozuki    

    Glad to hear you got the thumbs up from Docs Roz

I know smoking is rough but it seems an athlete, even one who smokes, would have better than average lung capacity.

    Sorry its been awhile but this quit has not been easy for me so I took a break from posting. I continue to watch videos and spend a lot of time reading at whyquit. Things are slowly easing up...certainly not as difficult as those first few weeks. My anxiety has eased up which is a blessing in itself. However, staying away from the boards is not a solution when quitting. So I will be more active. Started to exercise a bit and need to quit stuffing my face. Moving along and am staying strong. 
I just joined desperate1 and quit smoking not quite 2 hours ago. You're already helping me by stating your anxiety has eased up. I've let my anxiety get the best of me in the past which only leads me back to smoking. Which for me, creates even more anxiety. Craziness...
Glad you are back D1 and even happier you are still rockin' your quit
    Welcome and so glad that I have helped. My anxiety was horrible and I had to really fight in the beginning to keep the quit so I know where you are coming from. Hang in there cause eventually your mind set adjusts to the fact that smoking is off the table.  Keep fighting and things will ease up slowly but surely. We can do this. 
Hi desperate1, it's good to see you  I'm glad that your anxiety is easing. Quitting was very hard for me too but I found that for me staying glued to the forum kept my mind busy and not centered on smoking. Plus being able to support others is such a reward in itself no matter how far along in our quits we are So fyi, a couple of the 2019 quitters decided on Ashkickers for your class name and notsmokinjo designed an awesome logo, below, for your signatures
    Thanks Jillar. Love the logo and the name.  Yes staying close to the boards does help and sure makes the time go quicker. Nice to see you. 
Glad to see that you are still hanging in there desperate1!
    So happy to see you’re still quit. Congratulations!!
    Great news D.....   Join in the fun ..Quitting doesn't have to be all doom and gloom ...play some games.....look at the funny cats and dogs ....the days will pass more quicker with company ...
    Happy to know that you've stuck to your quit!!!
    So happy you are still quit and have returned to the forum.  Yes, anxiety is a tough part of quitting but you do not have to go it alone.  We have all been there.      You have done the tough stuff now.  The rest is a matter of redirecting your thoughts.  It gets easier every day.  
    Thanks everyone. Damn anxiety sleeping patterns all over the place. Just so mad at myself for even smoking at all. Still think of them and want it all to just go away. Too much romancing them. Read and watched so many videos my eyes hurt. Time to stop the pity party and be glad I made it this far. Thanks for all the encouragement. You all are so appreciated. 
That's right D1. We can't change those stupid decisions we made back when we started smoking. What's done is done. Now we just gotta pull ourselves up by the boot-straps and put in the time and hard work required to get us to the point where we can manage any thoughts we might have of smoking easily. We can't make it like we never smoked but ... we can commit to never smoking again
    Anxiety is horrible so big congratulations for sticking to your quit. 
My sleep was all over the place for a while ...I couldn't sleep ..I was in the board 24/7....but soon enough it went back to normal .   Remember all what you are feeling is temporary ....you just have to ride the waves ...
    I go for a daily walk around the block with my dog. Today we were almost home when I saw something in the middle of the sidewalk, a full pack of cigarettes! I stared at it in my hand for some time. Then I put them in a nearby mailbox and kept on walking. I guess I didn't trust myself to throw them away at home. 
    Good job kdad but I would love to see the reaction of the person who's mailbox you put them in lol
    Great job, shows the quit is really starting to stick now.  Good for now taking them home, not sure about the mail box unless that person smokes, but hey you passed the test!!!
    Great job, the main thing is you didn’t take them home 
    Great job, Kdad. 
You got this Kdad.  It is only forward from here!
Good job! I bet this resonated with you in terms of just how strong your quit has become. It's a great feeling and these are the moments we remember about our quit journeys  Edited April 22 by reciprocity

    Gotta love that.  The same thing happened to me early in my quit except I wasn't walking a dog, just myself.  Without thinking, I took all of the cigarettes out of the pack and threw them in a creek.  Unusual for me because I am very against littering.  I hope the person whose mailbox you put them in is not a recent quitter.  Imagine that!
What brand were they?  Good job on not smoking. I think if it had been me,  I likely would have given in depending on the brand. Just hope the universe doesn't decide to test you during a particularly weak time. The weak moments come and go.           17 hours ago, Pearlie said:               I hope the person whose mailbox you put them in is not a recent quitter.  Imagine that!               Oh that would be hilarious.

This is an interesting article about how tobacco companies are realizing people are quitting smoking and they need to hook people another way.          Philip Morris needs to kill smoking to survive ://a.msn.com/00/en-us/BBW2w7D?ocid=se
    And the big tobacco companies continue to march on and reap profits thru inflicting damage/injury to others.  I am so sad I ever fell into their trap.  I can only go forward and let others know the dangers, I do this by speaking to my grandchildren and they do listen -- they only have to look to me to see the damages!!!!
    They are fighting for their corporate survival in any and all ways they can, no matter who they hurt or kill along their way .... like they always have.    The Who did a song called; Won't Get Fooled Again! There was a lyric near the end of that song "meet the new boss, same as the old boss" - applies very much to big tobacco unfortunately   
    The one thing that gets to me now....is how I fell into the trap...the lies...for all those years ...   I'm angry at the tobacco companies ....and I'm  more angry at myself....    I hate them....
    When we were young, they made smoking look so appealing.  All the movie stars smoked and romanticized it.   I am ashamed of my foolishness.  I am hoping we can teach the younger generations.

Just yesterday I was reading a list of famous people (a lot of them movie/TV stars) who died of smoking related diseases; mostly lung cancer. The list went on and on and on. I couldn't even get to the end of it. It's amazing. When you watch those old TV shows and they are all happily smoking away ...... little did they know then that they were facilitating their own early demise. I remember a lot of them were between 60-70 when they died but some even a lot younger. It's shocking to look at those statistics.     I too am angry with tobacco companies but most;y at myself for ignoring the facts once they were made available to us. Regret does nothing positive though so all we can do is protect our own quits and do what we can to encourage others to take the step to freedom.Edited April 18 by reciprocity

Was it not just part of the times though? I mean where I grew up it was smoking cigarettes, drinking, and just generally being Johnny bad ass. And in my case I started driving trucks in the oil field's and smoked to stay awake all night. I mean... were we really duped? My  mom and dad smoked and I don't know why, but I was the only one out of 4 that picked up the nasty habit. I wish I never would have but it is what it is. I only have myself to blame, I do wish I could lay it on someone else but I have to suck it up. All we can do is move forward and try to make the best of our situation now.

I agree 100% with @Wantsit, I'm not going to hate the tobacco companies for something I chose to do. We have to take responsibility for our own actions.....

Bad news: A friend has been diagnosed (just this past Monday) with small cell lung cancer with brain metastases...very bad news, indeed. Smoked 2 packs a day for over 40+ years (she had quit about 4 years ago.)      Good news: My nephew has started on Chantix this month as he wants to quit smoking...says I am a good example for him!
    I'm sorry about your friend @Rozuki  And very happy that your nephew is quitting. It must feel good to be the example for him that quitting is possible

People at school smoked as did my mum.      I smoked through choice and I have to take responsibility for my own actions. I continued to do it even though I knew the risks.        Electronic cigarettes are a big market and tobacco companies are a business. From that perspective it makes sense that they go where the money is.
    As everyone knows I don't have anything against e-cigarettes.  Hadn't heard of the one in Linda's article so looked it up. This is a really long article so it might put you off reading it but in a nutshell it looks like there are whispers that their reports on how great this product is are a bit *cough* inaccurate.     https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tobacco-iqos-science/
@Rozuki I am so sorry about your friend. Hearing stories like this always make me wonder if I will get my life back or still suffer from the effects of smoking so long.  I do hope your nephew can follow your lead.
    I'm sorry too @Rozuki to hear the sad news about your friend ...    I often wonder if I have dodged the bullet ...but I intend to enjoy what life I have left ....smoke free.....   Your nephew has a great role model ..

Sadly for some of us we may have left it too late, but for many of us we have avoided that one ciggie that was the cincher....but for me when I got sick early in my quit and I faced treatment and I thought about smoking, (I mean what was the point in staying quit I was already sick), but you know what...I want to leave this life free of an addiction that controls me....I want to go out the master of myself.   @Rozuki I'm sorry for you and your friend.         So I despise big tobacco, but not because I was stupid enough to buy their lies...that's all on me...I'm angry with them because they think it's acceptable to profit from making people sick, they know the product they sell addicts the users, they know the product hurts and kills them and yet they see no issue continuing to profit from others misery, even innocent bystanders...that's what pissed me off. They know and they don't care...they want people addicted...just don't know how they look at themselves in the mirror and say "I'm good people".
@notsmokinjo I can't quote on my cell phone but what you said about getting sick and not giving in to going back to smoking says a lot.  I always was so ashamed that I smoked through breast cancer.  I would run in for my 15 min. radiation and then leave and light up.  Looking back it was kind of defeating the purpose.  That was not enough to scare me off cigarettes.    I am not looking back.  I am only going forward with the hopes of gaining as much life as I can.
@Linda Thomas but at the time, when you were fighting a battle for your life you weren't in the position emotionally to stage a war on two fronts....at the time the battle of the pink ribbon was the one that counted....but you are a different person now than then....now the time is right for this battle.
So﻿ I despise big tobacco, but not because I was stupid enough to buy their lies...that's all on me...I'm angry with them because they think it's acceptable to profit from making people sick, they know the product they sell addicts the users, they know the product hurts and kills them and yet they see no issue continuing to profit from others misery, even innocent bystanders...that's what pissed me off.

Phillip Morris makes the nastiest cigarettes out there anyways. Taste like bleach. Bunch of crooks. Even when I smoked I hated anything PM. I still do give to tobacco and nicotine companies though.

The education about the harmful effects of smoking was there then as it is now.     I stand by my first post, I chose to smoke. Sirius said it best, tobacco has a right to sell shovels. Oh and to quote Chris Rock, 'Dont hate the player, hate the game'.
I hate big tobacco because I have a type A personality and am an addict. Funny thing I am going on six months and have more craves now than I did at three. I wish I could jump in your time machine and go back to about about 40 years and just say NOPE! Just saying.
No Man's Land. Repost for jhhawaii      By tahoehal  on May 13 2008 at 5:54 pm  77, Male    Las Vegas   NV, United States   Member Since: September 01 2004 « Previous Entry  Next Entry »      I seldom start a post, unless it is to honor someone's anniversary. But I feel compelled to share something that I seem to be sharing a lot of lately... and that is my thoughts on 'No Man's Land'. No Man's Land is a dangerous and scary place... and it is a lonely time during a quit. I call No Man's Land that period of time between about 1 month and 3 or 4 months into your quit, or about the time from the end of your first month.. This is a time when many people slip and go into a full relapse and have to start over... if they can start over, that is. I have some observations that may help some of you who are literally hanging on by your fingernails... or who may find yourself there tomorrow.    The first month is an exhausting but exhilirating experience... you are locked in nearly daily struggles and you get the satisfaction of successfully beating your addiction that day. You go to bed a WINNER each night (as Troutnut would say), and you are justifiably proud of yourself. Your friends and family are also supportive as they see you struggling each day to maintain your quit. And you are being constantly supported here, whether or not you post... just being here is good for your quit. And so, the battles are won and it actually becomes easier and the battles occur less often as you finish 30 days or so. Around 60 days, you're starting to have some really good days, with very few craves and some nice insights about yourself... but then again, you still have some bad days. Those bad days can really be depressing... you begin to wonder if you're ever gonna be able to relax. Your junkie is whispering to you, telling you that 'just one' won't hurt. You've conquered your daily triggers, but now you start trippiing over the occasional ones... a death in the family, unexpectedly bad news, money problems, health problems, going on a long car ride, a trip to the bar, or whatever. You have a strong crave and you begin to doubt your ability to keep your quit.    In addition, the 3D support that you used to get is pretty much gone... non-smokers figure you should be 'over it' by now, smokers don't like to hang around you much because they feel guilty and addicted (remember that feeling?), and people who have quit may not remember just how much love and support you need well into the first few months. They all think you should be 'over it', you think you should be 'over it'... and the temptation is to have 'just one' to see if you ARE over it.    But of course you're not over it, are you? That 'just one' whisper becomes much much louder and becomes 'just one more'... and each time you give in to that whisper, the craves come harder and sooner. The one way to guarantee that your craves will never go away is to light up, to slide that old cigarette needle into your arm and shoot up. Those craves will be back and keep coming back. But if you protect your quit, your craves will eventually weaken and become even fewer and farther between.    As you get to around 100 days or so (some will be a bit longer)... you will begin to really get a healthy perspective on your addiction. You will see the huge role that smoking played in your life, you will see clearly what that addiction really cost you. And you will understand that it was a very high price to pay... the loss of your confidence, your emotions, your self-control... your SELF. All enslaved to your addiction. And you will begin to see that you can look forward to a non-smoking future without romanticizing your addiction. You see it clearly for the life-stealing evil it was... and is. You see a much different future for yourself than your past has been. And it no longer scares the crap out of you to think that you are done smoking... in fact, you embrace that thought with joy every day. But you have to get out of No Man's Land first. How can you help yourself? And how can those of us who have been through it help you?   First of all, you need to understand that you aren't alone. If you haven't already done so, make a pinky-finger promise with 2 or 3 good quitbuds and exchange phone numbers with them. Promise to call them if you're ever in trouble, and make them promise the same. These are your 'life and death' quitbuddies... you are literally trusting each other with your lives. Then call them... often. Just to see how they are doing, and to tell them you're doing well too. Be totally honest with them, this is life and death. Second, understand that you're going to have some unexpectedly bad days... but they are going to be further apart. Shrug them off, laugh your way through them, call your quitbuddies... whatever it takes to get through them without smoking. Some battles will be easy, some will be hard. Come here and post, send qmail, exercise, learn to cook, take up a new hobby. Whatever it takes, keep going to bed a WINNER each night.   Third, ask some of the older qsters to keep an eye on you... to contact you to see how you're doing. I have been asked to do that for several of you recently and I am happy to do that, as I am sure that others are too. We know that you just need to hold on a little bit longer and change your focus just a little to make that breakthrough. And then you will OWN your quit, and it will be a very comfortable thing.   Last, take a deep and honest look at your past life... your life as a smoker and compare it to what your life is like now... and what it will be like in the future. You have to develop that vision of your future, of the person that you are going to BECOME now that you have freed yourself. You have to believe in yourself. You have to love yourself enough to deny yourself your addiction.    No Man's Land doesn't have to be so lonely and scary and dangerous. You need some company and some courage and some faith in yourself. And when you emerge from it, you will not be the same person that entered it.    Never never never question your decision to quit! This is the most loving thing that you will ever do for yourself. A few days of discomfort in exchange for a lifetime of freedom. You will never find another deal like it.   Protect your quit. Don't smoke, no matter what. Hal 08-20-2004  A puff is too much, a thousand cartons are not enough.
    I vacillate between thinking NML is a "thing" and thinking it's just another excuse that relapsed folks use.  I know I FELT those things, and still do occasionally, but think it's more our inner addict messing with our minds.       Still think it's a good post and explanation!
    Excellent post. I it a thing, or an excuse? I do not believe it is either. Just like the long list of symptoms. You may have some, but seldom all. It's a possible condition. It was very strong for me. It led me to write. It concerned me. But I didn't relapse, so it wasn't an excuse. Just something else to be aware of so you are prepared for it if it comes your way.     I love this post Nancy. 
Oh god I'm only in week 3 but I've already hit no-man's land, I think because not everyone in my life even knew I smoked, and I never smoked that much, so people definitely think I should be over it by now. I will definitely be needing this place lol
@Ren my never smoker hubby thought I should be over it too after only a couple months. People who don't smoke can't understand. That's why my support forum was/is so important to me

Hiya. In 12 hours I’ll be 4 weeks smoke free. Still having “moments” though not as often, they seem to increase in intensity and duration. Still taking it 1 day at a time. Emotions still swinging from very proud to very depressed but hope this will settle soon. Good news is the brain fog’s gone but left a short temper/snarky tongue which is taking some managing lol.    Am having issues posting on here - not sure why . I can like posts but can’t always post comments- this is the first time I’ve been able to in over a week- you should all be grateful for that
As far as not smoking is concerned, all good so far. I will complete two smoke free weeks tomorrow, 15th April, 11:30 PM. Just sticking to my daily pledge of "Nope". Out of habit, the thought that its time for a smoke after eating still occurs sometimes and then I remember I'm smoke free and just forget about smoking. I drank Rum yesterday and did get triggered (for a very short while) for a cigarette but I did not smoke.    @Doreensfree I'm assuming the part about being nosy was a joke.Edited April 14 by Ankush
Glad to hear you two are doing OK and still on track with your quits! Readjusting to life as "normal" really does take quite awhile but you are both doing well and experiencing completely normal quit symptoms and yes Dizzy .... they will all correct themselves eventually. I know the one that took the longest for me was that hair-trigger temper thing - lol. They will all correct themselves though in time. Just keep moving forward because it doesn't get harder, it only gets easier the more time you spend not smoking. And, as you get past that 1st month or so be aware that you are entering what is referred to as "no man's land". Sounds daunting right? It's not really. It's just that period where the newness of your quit has worn off and things start becoming a bit of a chore at times. There's a post about it around here somewhere. I've included the link below for you. If you can't open the link, this post is on this same page below this Newbies Post. It's always good to be aware in advance what you can expect to experience so you don't think anything is abnormal with what you are going through. We all experience similar things and in the end, we all make it out the other side as permanent non smokers. Just keep adhering to NOPE!    Edited April 14 by reciprocity

I think I am still a newbie.  I am 8 mos smoke free.  I am amazed that I don't much think of smoking anymore.   It takes me getting really angry when I think about sabotaging myself and going back there.  I realize they are just self-destructive thoughts and childish!

I'm still here! I'm still quit! Life is currently rough, but the quit is solid. I just passed 100 days and feel stronger every day. I'm dealing with the sudden, unexpected passing of a loved one and the diagnosis of a very serious autoimmune disease--all without lighting up.     I am proof that you can weather any storm WITHOUT smoking. There is absolutely NO good reason to light up.
    Sorry to hear life has deal you some tough cards right now Abby but you're attitude is bang on. You can do and handle anything better WITHOUT smoking.  Heek up the great work! 
    Aww sorry your going through a tough time Abby....  It's good to hear your quit is good ,and you understand smoking would not change what was happening...  We believed the lie smoking helped us cope with curve balls in our lives ..in fact ..we cope much better without dealing with nicotine withdrawal too.. Sending Hugs xx
    I'm sorry about your loved one abby and your diagnosis but am so proud of you for being able to keep your quit.  xoxo
    Ankush, Linda, and Dizzy the three of you are doing great -- I enjoy seeing your progress.  Abby keep strong -- you have the will and the strength good job!!!!
    I'm glad to see you all doing great in your quits.  Thanks for the updates.         Stay strong Abby.  That is really rough what you are going through but you know a cigarette will not make anything better.

    I thought that I breezed through menopause about ten years ago.  I did have the mood swings but the hot flashes were nothing.  Just a few at night.     Well.......is it possible that the smoking helped to stave off the hot flashes.  I have been having hot flashes for the past week.  During the day and at night.  That part of my life should be over by now.   Did any other ladies notice this?  I don't know whether it is something that I should be concerned about.This sucks,  if I get to redo this part of my life!!!!
Hi Sweetie ...  I had a early menopause .age 40....I'm still getting symptoms....so I don't know whether quitting would make a difference ...   Any concerns best asking the doctor...we  are all different .......to me it just gets worse ....sorry I'm no help ....

    Linda mine was a breeze too with maybe just a few hot flashes. So far I have not had that happen to me but so early in my quit it may happen somewhere down the line. Hope it's nothing and goes away soon. Love your quit by the way. You inspire me
    Oh !!! You two were lucky ...a walk in the park to me..jealous here !!!
I too went through early menopause right after I got my tubes tied at 39 or 40. I do though on occasion get hot flashes at night but not sure that it has anything to do with quitting or menopause. Just a body regulating itself?

If you Google it Linda there are a number of reasons that may be causing them so never a bad idea to get a check up and a blood test Edited March 19 by jillar
    Sweetie ... Sorry to hear that Linda...yes please go and get checked ....just to ease your mind ...xxx
    Smoking most definitely affects hormone balance. It takes time for your endocrine system to recover after you quit. There is a lot of information out there on the web about it. (I did a quick google search upon reading your question!) If you are concerned, of course talk to your doctor. But I suspect what you are going through is quite normal.       P.S. Hot flashes suck!
1 hour ago, abbynormal said:                P.S. Hot flashes suck!          You got that right.  Well we won't let the newbies know that could be a side affect of quitting.  Thanks for googling it.
Linda...get a blood test done, ask for things like full thyroid function. I can't comment on menopause cos  still waiting....but seeing as we are talking plumbing and some of our newbies might still have monthlies...when I quit mine went screwy...it was all over the place, cycle wise, took about 8months to settle back to normal... And my hot flushes were my thyroid.. which the nicotine had been masking, probably for years.      My cycles was so all over the place and the mood swings and hot flushes I was sure it was menopause...but my GP suspected not hence the blood test....there are a few endocrine conditions that are masked by nicotine... Things with me were odd from the get go but when I stopped the nrt they went really wacky.Edited March 19 by notsmokinjo
@notsmokinjo  I didn't know thyroid could affect hot flashes.  I fell, while walking the dogs last year, and broke my nose and knocked myself out.  One of life's embarrassing moments!     When I came to, the police and ambulance were there.  They made me go to the emergency room.  When they scanned my head, they found that I did break my nose but also had nodes on my thyroid.  I did get them biopsied and they were okay but they did advise me to get them checked every six months.   I think I will check on that too. Thanks for the info.
Most women in western societies have one or 2 thyroid nodes and never even know and they are completely benign and don't cause any issues. But if you do have them it's worth keeping an eye on them.
Here are some linksCigarettes Sabotage Hormone BalanceDoes quitting smoking decrease the risk of midlife hot flashes? A longitudinal analysis           I was pretty much over hot flashes when I quit but, they never seem to go away, depending on my stress levels,  I am still having hot flashes at sixty something.       Likely culprit is thyroid nonsense like  @notsmokinjo mentions.     I will also get hot flashes if I drink too much or feel frisky 'down there'.     Edited March 20 by Sazerac
Hi LT- I'm in agreement that you should get some bloodwork done. The thyroid is the the Queen gland & very well could be the cause.  Still -as mentioned it could be hormones you thought were done playing the game.  Could even be psychological and/or cardiac- are you stressed out, overly worried or anxious?  Please report your symptoms to your doc.       Menopause is banging on my door.

I was one of the lucky ones....went thru menopause at 51...had 6-8 months of the hot flashes (which were intense....esp when they would happen during meetings at work!! I always carried one of those collapsible folding fans with me...if I didn't, then the sweat would just drip down my face!!!) I have 2 sisters...both younger than me who went thru it a younger age than me....and they both still have the hot flashes and one still gets the night sweats! Going on 10-15 years now for them with the hot flashes/night sweats...one is now vaping the last 4 years and the other still smoking. I have been quit for over 2 years and haven't had any issues with flashes/night sweats.....
Thought I'd check in to say hello and that for all you newbies, it does get easier - the first week is awful, the first few months are too!  After about 8 or 9 months, I got a liberating feeling and now I no longer have cravings and rarely think about it.  I do occasionally have dreams where I am smoking and then wake up and think - phew!        On 18 April at 11.20am, I will be 2 years quit!     Keep at it you lot!

Hi - I have just checked my Smoke Free app on my phone (which I would highly recommend!) and it says the following:     Time smoke free:  1 year, 11 months and 21 days Money saved:  £11,891 or £6022 per year Cigarettes not smoked:  21,620 - it's this figure that freaks me out!   Life regained:  180 days    Time spent not smoking:  75 days        You can all do this!    Claire
    Congratulations on nearly two years quit Claire, and thanks for the update and positive words for our newbies 
Your time spent not smoking is very interesting. It really adds up doesn't it?  Congrats on 2 years smoke free          It really is amazing how all that slavery to nicotine then all the angst from quitting just melts away with time leaving us exactly where we want to be - non smokers for life
Great to see you Claire ... Congratulations on your fabulous 2 year quit ...inspirational....
    Great job Claire.       Freedom ages like wine.  Savor the flavor.
    When I see how many people haven't smoked it really shocks me.      Congratulations on a great quit. 
    Congratulations Claire!   I'm glad you are doing so well in your quit.
    Congratulations on your continued freedom, Claire!  Stay vigilant and enjoy!        Jim
Posted 07 April 2009 - 11:31 PM Dear ___________,   I am about to try and change my life for the better. I have quit smoking. I just wanted to write this letter to you so you know what to expect for the next couple of weeks, since the process of withdrawal can be very challenging for me, and for those around me. (Most people do not realize it, but nicotine addiction is literally one of the hardest drugs to kick, even harder than heroin).   Everyone reacts to the withdrawal symptoms differently, but in general, during the first two weeks (Hell Week and Heck Week), I will most likely not be my normal self. My attention will literally be taken up with fighting the physical and mental urges to smoke. I may cry, I may yell, I may ignore you. Worst of all, I may say hurtful things to you, but I want you to know that this is the nicotine talking, not my heart. I WILL apologize afterwards, once the nicotine has left my body and my mind has cleared, but for the moment, please, PLEASE remember that I care about you, and let it roll off your back.    You need to know that when a smoker quits, the body and the mind will try almost anything to trick the user into taking another puff. I may rationalize that "now is not a good time" I may talk about feeling a sense of emptiness and loss. My body may develop aches and pains. I may not be able to sleep. I may act like the pain I am experiencing.   But be aware that I am doing this for ME, not for you. In this one important way, I have to be selfish, so that I cannot give the nicotine a reason to put the blame on anyone else.    Here are 10 things you CAN do to help:  • Be there when I need a hug, but don't be hurt when I push you away.   • If I tell you to leave me alone, give me space, but don't go too far...I need to know you are near no matter what the nicotine says.  • Don't try to argue with me when I start to rationalize...silence is a more powerful message.  • Avoid the topic of cigarettes (because I'm trying to get them off my mind), unless I bring it up first.   • Do the best you can to act as if everything is normal. The more "normal" you act, the faster I will get there.    • Consciously try to avoid letting me get into stressful situations...if something stressful can be put off for a couple of weeks, please try to do so. If not, please try to cushion me.   • Just keep telling me it will get better and that this effort is worth it.     • Tell me I am strong. Tell me you are proud of me. But also, tell me you will be there no matter what I say or do. I just wanted to prepare you because the first two weeks are usually the worst, but be aware that it doesn't suddenly get better...it will be a gradual process. Also, please be aware that while I am doing this quit for me, you and those around me will benefit as well. I will be free from the shackles of needing to know where the closest cigarette store is. I will be free of the smell. I will be free of an early death. And I will be free to spend more quality time with those I love.  Thank you in advance for being strong enough to care about me, and help me through this.    Love,   Me
    I always liked this one. It lays out pretty much exactly what to expect in the early days and loved ones close to you can either be a huge support to you or can make things even more difficult depending on how they react to your quit. Remember .... it's you quitting and going through all these difficult emotions and stressors not them so the better prepared they are the more they are likely to be able to help you out.
    I too liked this one and had even used a variation of this to my son and his family and it did help prepare them for that first month, it also let them know that this quit was for me -- no excuses, no one to blame but me, however their support would be helpful.  
    ^^^ And guess what ..... You Did IT!!
if you need a reason to quit heres one for you my brother in north Dakota needs  lung transplant   surgery do to emphysema from smokeing  . he has to be on 8 liters of oxagyn a minute just to breath. sitting he fine moving is a real hard for him because it takes all his engry just to go across the room. he singed up to be on a transplant listbut has to wait to see if the accept him or not if not he wont be here very long . he was calling all of us to let us know hes dieing so quit now don't wait . pray for him his name is eric .       love  not smiling today jimmy
    Prayers for your brother Jimmy. I hope he gets the help he needs.   None of us realize just what we are exposing ourselves to when we start smoking and even while we continue to indulge in that horrible addiction. Unfortunately we all live in self denial while we continue to expose ourselves to so much potential health implications.
I'm really sorry about your brother Jimmy, i'll keep positive thoughts that he will be accepted for a lung transplant...Edited April 9 by jillar
    Sorry to hear this Jimmy, my prayers will be with you and your brother !!!
    Sorry about your brother Jimmy.     Thanks for giving another reminder of the real cost of smoking.     Best wishes to you and your family.
    Awww this is so sad.        Sending my prayers to Eric and for all of you.      Take good care Jimmy 
    I'm really sorry to hear about Eric, Jimmy.  He is in my prayers.       Smoking really is horrible.
    Prayers for Eric and all his loved ones.  (((Jimmy)))
    Sending prayers to Eric and all the family ...I hate smoking with a passion ... I never thought I would say that in my life time ...prayers he gets the help he needs .xx
    So sorry Jimmy.  I am definitely sending prayers your way.      Reading this, I am so grateful that I was able to find the help here that I needed to quit.  
    So sorry Jimmy that is such sad news.  Smoking never does anything positive.    My thoughts are with you and your family.
    Prayers out to Eric and your family, Jimmy. Smoking is such a horrible addiction. Many addictions today overcome the life and the being quickly. Many times nicotine takes years to damage the body so we think it will never happen to us,  until it does.     Keep us posted. I feel confident that your brother will get what he needs. Hopefully he never smokes again.
    If found please return ASAP. Greatly missed by owner and family.    Free to any home : Brain Fog and General Grumpiness     So how long did it take for you to feel “normal” again? I know it’s not a quick fix and varies but would be interesting to know. TIA
    Hello dizzyd, by your post I think you've still got your sense of humor, at least some of it  Everything you're experiencing is normal at your stage of quit but the good news is that it's all temporary.  As far as the brain fog, I found eating sweets helped with that. For me it lasted almost a month I'd say. My grumpiness lasted a bit longer and I think it was honestly around the six month mark that I started feeling better.    It's important to remember that we are all so different in our quits so time lines for me won't necessarily be the same for you. I also quit more because I had to and not because I wanted to so that makes a huge difference in how your quit goes too.   I think you're doing awesome, congratulations on being done with hell week. That's the hardest week of all! 
    Hi DizzyD,      When I quit cold turkey several years ago, I thought the first month was pretty difficult.  After that, things started to slowly get better.  After one month, I still had temper tantrums and mental meltdowns once in a while, but the general everyday grumpiness was gone.  It took me a while to learn how to deal with my emotions as a non-smoker.  Things could improve quicker for you, we're all unique.  Hang in there!      Regarding brain fog, I didn't have that problem.  I actually felt like the fog lifted when I quit.      Mona
DizzyD,     Congrats on getting through Hell Week! I found the 1st day, 1st week and 1st month to be the most torturous! As the days add up all the craziness starts to fade away....where's your ticker?
With me the brain fog lasted I would say a couple of weeks and was still there a little for a week or so after that. I have heard people say it could be that your blood-sugar level is lower than when you smoked and that drinking fruit juice can help boost your leves. Not sure if that actually works or not. General crankiness and having a short fuse was probably the longest lasting symptom for me. That lasted off and on for a good 6 months I would say. Now, that wasn't constant or all the time but it did show itself from time to time. I think that was just me being impatient with the whole adjusting to being a non-smoker process. That symptom can vary hugely based on what your personality is to begin with I think. Many say "embrace the suck"and "focus on the positives" which is very true in reality but not everyone is able to do that. It does help though to step back from time to time, take a few deep breaths and think about the big picture - your end goal of having a healthier life and one free from being a slave to your addiction. Those are pretty big prizes so it''s no wonder there's some ugliness involved.      Keep going and congrats one your 1st week! There's the worst one done and in the bin!
I had pretty bad brain fog for a few months and a general sense of irritability and grumpiness for long after that.     I'd say around the 9 month mark was when I realized I felt "normal".     2 years later, it's all just a blur -like it never happened. Stick with it and know that it will get better and will all be worth it.
Oh yes, quitting is a process and it takes time to go through that process.  It takes a few weeks to get rid of that "foggy feeling" (though as said above it varies from person to person).  After about 2-3 weeks you will begin to notice some positives, small and large, from quitting -- focus on those victories, they will carry you through until you feel close to "normal" and that will just sneak up on you and slap you in the face like it did me last fall.  In short work through the process and celebrate each victory and each day and you will benefit greatly and see that it can be done!!!!
Ride with it.... Watch a funny movie, listen to chill out music, eat popcorn or whatever lol, anything to make you feel better. Plenty of treats, dont worry about the weight gain, just focus on you. I had brain fog and severe lethargy first few weeks, my electric blanket and a good movie comforted me. Id say about month 4 i started to feel a bit better, then much better and confidence  improved around month 8. Time seems to stand still the first few weeks, but honestly, it then seems to accelerate... and that normal feeling returns.  Hang in there....
I hardly think about it anymore, even when leaving airports after a flight - I would spark up as soon as I got outside!     For me the process was:     Week 1 - hell on earth! Month 1 - as above! After 2 months, I was still getting triggers when I got in the car, off a train etc 6 months - the triggers were fewer  9 months - as above 1 year - so chuffed and felt liberated  Now at nearly 2 years  - I would never ever want to smoke again and the thought of it makes me feel rubbish     I was on 30 a day, so if I could do it, you all can!
Oh a March quitter like I was and uk based!!  Look at you go and heading for your month, not long now    Mind you I was March cause I screwed up the new year quit lol. I digress though.       The fog is a real thing huh. I seem to recall feeling better, getting the odd bitch slap but better after 6 weeks. Much clearer after month 3 and although that sounds like a world away it really isn't if you just put one foot in front of the other for a while and start to educate yourself on the reality of what smoking does to us.  Although everyone is different I seem to remember folks on my level reporting about the same. Try having a run though, even if you don't run...it's fab how much further you can get already (I got about 500 yards but prior to that I would have had to massively cough and regroup now run 3k comfortably without any training).       You may feel cranky and grumpy, but what you are giving yourself is a real gift. Not just the quitting but the self respect and the ability to trust yourself to dig deep in future - the unexpected gains from quitting. Keep going. xx
        Vape Nation: Vaping Is Bad, Kids    The Surgeon General declared youth e-cigarette use to be an epidemic, but many vaping   communities online downplay the risks. What does the evidence show?https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/vape-nation-vaping-is-bad-kids/         EZPZ
    No doubt that Vaping is bad and the science is there to prove that fact.  What is also disturbing is the marketing behind it.  Cigarettes long ago were no longer allowed to be advertised, however that is not true for vaping since there are televised commercials.  This also should be addressed because it only reinforces the idea that vaping is a safe alternative (which is not true).  I am afraid so many others will be lost to nicotine at this point!!!
    I noticed that a huge vape shop/lounge near me is gone.  It is now a tattoo and piercing studio.   Is the fad starting to fade?
    I think vaping is nonsense. I tried it for a very short while and then gave it up. Its no good. Just makes the insides of the ears so itchy. Besides, if one thinks about it, NRT as a whole is pointless. One is just substituting one Nicotine source for another. Nicotine is the addictive drug. Whats's the point of substituting one addictive source (cigarettes) for another (NRT)? It does not help beat the addiction for good, just changes the source while keeping the person still addicted. 
@Ankush while I agree that vaping is nonsense I do not agree with your stance on other NRT's. We've got lots of successful quitters who have quit using NRT. Yes, they had nicotine in their systems longer but they used them as recommended and quit smoking.  That's the goal right?!  
    As long as you stick to the programme ...NRT can be a useful tool ...we have had alot of successful quitters ..who quit using NRT....

I was just speaking from experience. I had tried Nicotine gum for a few days. It just made me want to smoke more. There are other forms of NRT as well, (medications such as Chantix and Zyben) but that will just shift the dependency from one source to another. Maybe such medication is helpful for people who take psychiatric medication, however, all medication comes with its own side effects which may not be disclosed by the doctor or insufficient information is available on the internet about such drugs. Again, its just about shifting dependency from one source to another source.
    You sound ready to jump on @Ankush.....go on ...I dare you !!!!...

Btw, is there a thread on Quittrain for people who do take psychiatric medication and are trying to quit smoking? I searched a lot, but I could not find such a thread.

I do not think there is a lot of connection between body modification and nicotine use. One might argue that both appeal to similar demographs. I think some vape shops might be closing shop simply because there is so much competition right now. It is the next big thing and everyone is trying to get rich off it.        Not that this matters but the place i got my couple tattoos done, it almost looks like a doctor's office inside. I was hoping for a colonoscopy but I guess that is not part of the procedure.

I have not smoked or used any nicotine since, but there is bad news...        That day i became addicted to cold turkey. The very next day, I was at the deli getting a cold turkey sandwich. On thanksgiving, I have to let the turkey get cold before I can eat it. Sometimes when I go to visit people, I have to excuse myself to go eat a piece of cold turkey. One time I was so desperate but broke, I went to the deli to get five pounds of cold turkey, and I ran out without paying! People complain that my clothes, car, and house smell like cold turkey. I will quit one day. I have tried to quit but after a couple days I say, "one slice won't hurt" but then the cycle starts all over.       What is the lesson here? Umm, I don't know.

Umm, I don't know.     @Jet Black Vaping cannot be harmless water vapor. It contains Nicotine and a chemical called Propylene Gloycol and the latter's effects on the human anatomy have not yet been fully understood. I find it hard to believe that a person can literally get addicted to cold turkey meat. In any case, the lesson for us all is never to start smoking in the first place.

Too much focus is put on the nicotine and not enough on the habit.

Nicotine is an addiction, but the act of smoking can be an addiction too (since that is the way Nicotine is administered into our bodies)? We all have been so used to smoking cigarettes, that the very act of not smoking cigarettes can be a brain drain at the beginning of a quit. As per my experience, when I did try NRT, it literally left a weird taste in my mouth that made me want to smoke more (with the gum), and made my ears itchy and just didn't give me the satisfaction of smoking a real cigarette (with the e-cig). That's why I gave up on NRT. I realized its just a waste of time and money for two reasons - first, it costs much more than regular cigarettes (where I come from), second it just makes me want to go back to smoking regular cigarettes and also because I realized its just a different way of administering Nicotine in the body. If its the act of smoking that bothers you, then may be you could do what Jillar did - use a straw and call it Jillar's air cigarette. I never tried it (didn't need to), but may be it will work for you.
    You have a great attitude A...keep yourself grounded and youv,e got this ...I just had a punching pillow ..worked for me .!!!    
    NRT worked for me purely because my issue was more about the habit and psychological addiction than it was the physical...once I broke the back of the habit, of the psychological compulsion is stoped the gum. The nicotine side of it was much easier for me. Do I feel that NRT prolonged the angsty, early stages of my quit?...yep, if for some stupid reason I had the time over would I use the NRT again?...yep, why??? Because it worked for me... it's doesn't work for everyone, many don't need it.. but I did.    SOS helps just as many as it doesn't. If you don't bother to post an SOS you'll never know if it works for you.

The nicotine side of it was much easier for me. Do I feel that NRT prolonged the angsty, early stages of my quit?...yep, if for some stupid reason I had the time over would I use the NRT again?...yep, why??? Because it worked for me... it's doesn't work for everyone, many don't need it.. but I did.                    SOS helps just as many as it doesn't. If you don't bother to post an SOS you'll never know if it works for you.         @notsmokinjo I think its just best to do what works best for a given individual. Some may need NRT, some may not. I guess it doesn't matter in the end, as long as we don't smoke. @Lilly Yes, beating the addiction is what matters eventually.
    Stay Focused on the prize @Ankush.....your doing great.....you are beating that Nico Monster...

My husband used to ask why I didn't try vaping instead of smoking cigarettes. (He can't stand the smell of cigarettes.) I told him that no other form of nicotine had the same effect. I tried vaping. I didn't see the appeal.        Cigarette smoking is a complex addiction. Of course there is the addictive substance, nicotine, to deal with. But then there is the act of smoking--by that I mean the physical act--that is appealing to smokers. There is the habit of smoking--all of the places, events, etc. that trigger the desire for a smoke. And there are the cigarettes themselves--the taste, the brand, the buzz.     It's all evil, I tell you!

Why is it ok to advertise these but not cigarettes? Seems hypocritical to me. NOT that I want to see cigarettes advertised. I just don't see one as better than the other. Merely my opinion, of course.
    These are not advertised in the UK...   I have just lost another friend ..who used a E Cig....I am convinced this was the cause ...on both accounts...

Sorry for your loss @Doreensfree.       No vape adds down under. It is illegal to sell them with nicotine down here. In some states you can import nicotine liquid but only enough for a 2 month individual supply.

    Brill book. I did not read it in my forever quit (this quit) but i still retain some of the info read in it all those years ago. All good. Get reading folks. 
    This book definitely changed my view of smoking.  Definitely worthwhile reading for anyone quitting or thinking about quitting.
    Thanks Doreen. I found the book in pdf format online and haven't been able to put it down. I agree with johnny. It has changed my view of smoking and quitting smoking. 
    This book pulled the blinders off & I could finally see the true nastiness that is addiction to nicotine.  
    Bump...for anyone who has not read this amazing book ...
    One of the most important books I ever read.        Exposed the myths surrounding smoking and made the lies we told ourselves as smokers impossible to defend anymore.
Not a fan of the book (to say the least); I share that not at all to troll on the original post or supporters of Carr, but instead to speak to those who might read it and feel like maybe they're missing something or that there's something wrong with their quit.  It's not for everyone, and as long as you're not smoking you're doing great.  Lots of people have benefitted from the book, and I certainly respect its impact.              Christian99 17+ Years Quit Edited April 5 by Christian99
    I read it years ago and quit but failed quickly in that quit.   But still to this day retain some of the logic from the book. It is invaluable. I say read the book for sure. It will only help you.    It wasn't a magic book for me but it did teach me a hell of a lot which is what quitting for good is all about. 
    I read it recently as someone gave me a copy as a gift.  Just like the forum take what you need and leave the rest. 
I think there is a lot of good information in the book but here is the problem that I have with it.  In Chapter 1, he talks about his wife sending him to a hypnotherapist for his smoking.  After the session,  he lost his desire to smoke.  To quote, "not only did I stop smoking, but I actually enjoyed the process even during the withdrawal period."  So, it seems to me that he did not use his own "Easy Way" (which is not easy by the way...ha ha) to quit smoking.  Hypnosis is what worked for him.  I did somewhat benefit from reading the book but it is not the end all be all for me.

Allen Carr finally stopped smoking on 15 July 1983, aged 48, after a visit to a hypnotherapist. However, it wasn't the hypnotherapy itself that enabled him to stop – "I succeeded in spite of and not because of that visit" and "I lit up the moment I left the clinic and made my way home...".

I now know that nicotine and tobacco produce something of a "high". Maybe like a watered-down "stoned" effect one gets from smoking weed.   For me, I was on that tobacco "high" for 15 years. I never really noticed just how bad many drivers were.   Anyways, since quitting 1.5 years ago, I notice a lot of drivers suuuuuck. Everything from aggression, not paying attention, tailgating on the highway, not using headlights when it is dark out, whatever. Today though, there was a wreck on the highway. This was hours ago yet I am still annoyed. Because of ONE careless needle-prick driver, 100's of peoples' day was thrown off. I was late for work.      You know, I ain't gonna lie. If I were a "Stress smoker", today would have done me in. I feel like jack slapping someone but not too much like smoking. I even told my room mate that if stress were  trigger then I would have picked it back up this day. But no, my trigger to want to light up is excitement. Like if Micheal Bolton released a new album. OK kidding, don't no one listen to that.     So anyways, however long you have been quit for, did you notice drivers started to suck worse at that point?
    I noticed that drivers got worse once cell phone became popular.  Too many people yapping on the phone and not paying attention.  Didn't notice anything different when I quit smoking.

    I don't think anyones driving got worst but my temper did. Stupid things would turn me all Rambo like someone not indicating at a roundabout.       Sounds like you've just become more angrier too 
    My life became less stressful when I vowed to not take anything that happens in traffic personally and quit reacting to all the idiocy I see on the roadways every day.     My reaction to stupid drivers now is pretty much limited to me grumbling something along the lines of: "what the....you f***ing idiot."  Then a deep breath and move on.        I used to do the whole "road rage" thing.  It's pointless, dangerous, and a real waste of energy.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
so get this - I have worked at the same place over seven years. Seldom ever saw anything stupid. But...     Friday someone was in a wreck. Monday there was one, Tuesday there was one and I was 20 minutes late, and today I left early just to account for any BS I might encounter. Surr as a crap diaper stinks, there was a wreck close to my job. In do not work weekends but anyways, so I am wondering how many days in a row, HOPING no one hits MY heap of blue crap.     You know, back in Dec 2015, someone side swiped my car because I was in the turning lane and he was at a red light, he was trying to get to the gas station. Just pulled out right in front of me. Yeah I got a nice insurance check (more than the car was worth)  Pop quiz - GUESS, just GUESS what he was going in to buy while we waited for the police? KTQ kids.
It's just the way things are today.     I took a long hiatus from riding motorcycles and now that I'm regularly riding again -and I'm hyper-aware of everything- I notice damn near everyone is talking/texting nowadays.       They good news is that you can spot these idiots a mile away, so they're pretty easy to avoid. I don't really like to wish harm on anyone, but I often find myself wishing these selfish douchebags end up in a ditch.Edited April 4 by JimHannoonen

I have just put out my last cigarette. I forced myself to have it just so I could say I had my last cigarette at 7.20pm. I physically couldn't inhale but I needed to go through the whole last cigarette ritual.       I'm on day 5 of pneumonia and I can't hear much above the sound of my chest. I can't walk to the toilet without help, I haven't washed my hair or had a shower in all that time. I take more steroids, inhalers and antibiotics than I can count and still I can't breathe. This is the most frightened I have ever felt but I am one of the lucky ones. I know I will be up and about in time but if I carry on smoking this could be my life.         I sleep as much as I can and have almost zero energy so I won't be able to take part too much but will read x
    Addiction is a horrible thing, Lilly, but it is conquerable.    I hope you are able to quit smoking.     
    Oh Lily, I hope you can quit this time.  It is amazing how much healthier you feel after quitting.  Take care and we will be here to help you through.
    Aw Lilly that sounds fecking horrible. You need to chuck the fags big time!!!       Have you got a plan or just going for it? 
    Just going for it. It's really easy when you physically can't smoke. The choice has been taken away so no internal debates, no thoughts - just nothing.     Hope you're ok and life is good x
    Sorry you're not feeling good Lilly. Congrats on throwing the cigs away. You can do it this time. Stay close and post an SOS if you feel yourself caving to a crave

    Could be Allen Carr logic, I remember smoking the 'last cigarette' at one point during that book. You are told to.      Im sure plenty of us have smoked a 'last cigarette'. And thought through it, this is it, this is the last fag.

I really believe awareness about ones own junky mind comes afterwards and needs to be cultivated. Thats where a solid quit is build..        -edit- I think what I mean is, putting it out is, as crazy as it sounds, just a part of quitting. Its really nothing more than... putting it out. The ritual thing gives the cigaret way more credit than it deserves.      I whish you determination this time, Lilly. You say you didnt have a choice, health wise. There's always choice, whether its about smoking a last one OR smoking a first-of-many-one.        Edited March 1 by MLMR
    I remember being that sick....no way could I have smoked ....but as soon as I was on the mend ...I made up for lost time ..smoking more ....    I wish my junkie brain had said to me .....Dont be a jerk ...    
We'll need to tell Mr Carr to edit that part out his book that has helped 30 million people quit smoking.       Every single person here smoked a last fag before quitting. We all did it. Healthy or not healthy.      No one quitting should be scoffed at and certainly not because of their health status.

    Jeez. When someone is still smoking they are clearly still addicted, still an addict. Someone smoking their last fag is still in the midst of addiction. Red flags, eat your heart out. Never have guessed we re at a stop smoking forum? Addiction is a bitch and something some of us have overcome, some are still trying. But a sick person smoking their last fag and trying to quit.... If I had lung cancer and wanted to quit would you be equally as cold to me? Smoking a last fag is the norm!!!! No red flags. Read the book. Book or not we all did it. Folk here have had family members die as smokers from smoking related illnesses. Everyone deserves encouragement not a pissy attitude 
    Hope you are back to good health soon, Lilly.
I had my last smoke at 11:48pm on 27th of November 2017....we all had a last smoke. Don't get caught in the semantics.      A big part of smoking is the ritual, only makes sense that for some a big part of quitting will be ritual as well...

Work as a team ..spur each other on....what have you got to lose ...it just might get you both your sticky quit...if not .....then you havnt lost anything you had before.. Consider it ...plus you two should stay closer and post more often ,this also will spur you both on ... Try something different ....who knows ...what magic will happen ...  
    Thanks everyone for your posts.         A couple of people came to sit with me through the week. One brought soup and the other brought me the Allen Carr book.         I had the cigarette for two reasons. One because it was what he said to do, and two because if I hadn't then as soon as I was better that would be my reason for relapsing. I knew I would tell myself I hadn't had that last cigarette so I'm going to do it now etc.      I am definitely going down the NRT route so I'm trying out lots of different stuff tomorrow night. 
    I hope whatever you choose works for you, Lily.  Have you ever had a long-term quit?  If not, trust me when I say that it's great!

I had my last poison stick right after the doctor at  urgent care told me I had a stroke.

    Hey Lilly,  How is your quit going ?    How many days ? How are you feeling ?   How are you dealing with triggers and craves ?  Are you using any NRTs ?
Gosh that's like a cross examination        I'm still quit but definitely not confident. I've been in bed since I quit and only got up today. Haven't had to deal with triggers/craves yet.         Not using NRT yet but do have a pack of lozenges on standby.Edited March 9 by Lilly
@Lilly it's probably a blessing you've been in bed all this time. I slept for about 3 days after I quit. Sleep can help you get through the worst of it. I hope you are feeling a bit better. I'm sorry you've been so sick!        You will grow more confident in your quit as time passes.

I WANT to be a non smoker, I WANT to be happy I've quit and I WANT more than anything to have a lido deck party. So why when I want it so much do I always go back. Even now I know it's not if I go back it's when I go back.         I know that isn't what anyone on a quit smoking site wants to hear but I'm just being honest.       Cigarettes always win in my life.
    Lilly - it's the same for all of us no matter what path we take to quit smoking. NRT Champix or cold turkey; doesn't matter, It's all the same in the end. You have to be prepared to endure a short period of discomfort in order to feel normal again without smoking. It's just the way it is for everyone. Until you are prepared to go through that adjustment you will struggle and repeat the same scenario you have done for over a year now . You need to just quit smoking!! It won't kill you but continuing to smoke might just do that         Based on what you have said over this past year I am very concerned that you may have already done damage to your lungs. Have you seen a pulmonologist for an assessment of your lung function in the past year? (A PFT assessment and CT Scan of your lungs) If not; please do this. You need to stop smoking right now and get your lungs checked. This is serious business. Just do it no matter what the temporary upset to you might be. You can't afford to go on like this! I'm sorry if this upsets you but you need to address your addiction to nicotine immediately!         We all thought we could not live without cigarettes at one time but we have all just said ..... NO; no more!! And, we have all endured what ever discomfort we had to in order to come out the other side as non smokers. YOU CAN DO IT TOO!! You need to believe this and just do it. Like I said, quitting won;t kill you.
    Stop giving the smokes so much power Lilly... you are the one with with power, only you... you need to be the one to not put something in your mouth and burn it. The battle isn't with anything but yourself Lilly.... you have to let yourself win... first step is believing you can do it.
    Lilly...you are no more addicted to what any of us where....    We just made the decision to never smoke again ....Ever ....no matter what was happening ...    You just have to want it bad enough ....you carnt enter a quit half-hearted ...it has to be the whole of you ....
    Lilly, it is plain and simple that you are an addict.  You become obsessed with that cigarette you are not going to have the minute you quit.  That is what an addict does. You need to concentrate on how wonderful a life is without them.    I was scared to death to quit but the minute I realized I could, the thought of going back repulsed me.  Once you gain the power to quit,  you need to hold onto it.  Respect it, admire it and hold onto it with all you have.   Distraction is the most important.  You were a wonderful blogger.  You really put meaning in your feelings.  You are worth so much more than that cigarette.  I believed in you from the beginning.  Now, you need to believe in yourself.    This illness has gotten you through the withdrawal period.  Take that and go with it. You have the power to do this!
    You've been given great advice Lilly, use us to help you past those first hard days/weeks/months. Post an SOS if you think you're going to cave to a crave and let us help you through it. No one here is a special snowflake, we all had to endure the misery and we all made it through to the other side. You can too...……...
    Keep posting about what you are feeling.    When you see your words you can't help but  have awareness of your Self Sabotage.       You can break this silly and dangerous pattern. It is all about choice. You have power to put nicotine away just like all of us did.    It is not rocket science.  It is a simple choice.  NOPE.        The addict's voice is LOUD. You needn't listen and obey anymore.    Go forward on the journey.       
                                            Cigarettes always win in my life.                                                   This right here is why you keep going back. You are giving the cigarettes too much power. As others have already said, the power is within YOU. The cigarette can't jump into your mouth and light itself.      The choice is YOURS.        We are all addicts here. None of us had it easy. We all struggled with addiction and the desire to quit. (Otherwise we wouldn't be here.) And we all made a choice to stop putting those sticks in our mouths and lighting them on fire. That's it. There's no big secret to it. You make the CHOICE every day...every hour...every minute...NOT to smoke.      I believe you when you say you want to be a non-smoker. I'm here to tell you that you CAN make it happen!       I'm here to offer support anytime. Don't hesitate to reach out.     Love, Abby
Thank you everyone for your replies.        I did hit the self destruct button like I always do and after being up for an hour I smoked. I didn't SOS because I knew nobody was going to stop me and I didn't want to go through the motions and waste everyone's time.         Do you know what breaks my heart right now?  It's not smoking, it's not that I'm a complete failure - it's you people. I'm throwing away quit after quit and you all care more about me than I do about myself. I'll be honest and say I thought Jo, Doreen and Reci had completely washed their hands of me and my quits. When I saw all your names I couldn't help but cry.       Reci I have already received some news about my lungs.  Nothing is confirmed at this stage it is just what my Doctor thinks could be wrong.  They want to wait six weeks before they do the tests so my chest is recovered from this illness.       So this morning after reading all your messages I went to see a Quit Smoking Counsellor. She wants me to use patches for the full 12 week course as she thinks this will appeal to my OCD. Following programmes is something I usually flourish with and I like to see them through.        So I will be back when I start this on Wednesday which is No Smoking Day in the UK. Again picking a special day also appeals to my OCD      Thank you again. You have no idea how much you all make a difference to other peoples lives x
    I sincerely hope the direct one on one counselling helps keep you focused and on track Lilly. Another thing that quitting will do for you is show you just how strong you can be. The feeling of pride in accomplishing this amaze you. We're always standing by here to support you and anyone else making a serious attempt at quitting this ugly addiction.
I'm sorry that you had to go to a quit smoking Councillor but I am happy that you did. You now have a plan and I used my OCD and competitive streak to get me through the first few months. So I was mainly competing against myself but it worked for me. You have to deal with the OCD anyway, why not embrace it and make it work for you. So create a routine for yourself... at x time each day you watch a video or read an article... only needs to be 5mins worth... but its a pattern and a commitment.... build your knowledge because knowledge is power. Weegie used a quit councellor and look how successful that was for her. So maybe even a daily mantra.... I don't want to smoke, I will not smoke.... and then as you pop off to bed at night.... "I don't want to smoke, and today I didn't".Edited March 11 by notsmokinjo
I am sorry but, not surprised to hear you relapsed, Lilly.You dropped red flags all over the place.That is one of the reasons why I asked you about your quit , earlier in this thread.  I thought if you were encouraged to stay current with yourself, you might avert another relapse.The responses from this community have been spectacular.  Please take them all to heart.    Addiction is a serious business and it takes being brutally honest with yourself, which turns out to be one of the best rewards.    I am sorry you are waiting until Wednesday. I bet those last few smokes are going to be scrumptious (not).Wednesday is not a magical day that ensures a successful quit, you know.If you don't commit to yourself and your quit you might as well forget it.    Will you educate yourself about your addiction ?I know you think you are educated 'enough'  but, it obviously isn't sinking in.     Education will help you separate from addiction.You can begin to understand your actions and feelings through the withdrawal process instead of acting out.     Education gives you Power.So does quitting.     Freedom from nicotine opens up a whole new world of self-respect and confidence and the ability to honestly Trust yourself.All of which will benevolently change you.Please give your quit and yourself a chance.               
I can see why you have picked Wednesday ....it's a statement ..NO SMOKING DAY...but ....    It sounds as if your lungs need help from today !!!!....so why wait ....?????   We have had quite a few people quit with help with patches ..you can do this ....   We can support you 100%....but Lilly you have to do the work ....

    Lilly,  Are you on NRTs ?   Have you being advised by a counselor ? What kind of counselor are they ?   Do you have a plan that you worked out ?        Answer if you will, I think it would be helpful for those newly quit or about to jump into a quit.  It will also be helpful to your supporters in guiding you the best way.     It is always very exciting starting a new adventure, use your exuberance to solidify your commitment to yourself.   Your smiles will be rewarded.                
    Congrats on getting back on your quit Lilly, let's do this!  We're all here to help so use us as needed when needed.....

We have places where you can just walk in, have a chat and you get free NRT for 8 weeks. They gave me patches but I haven't put one on yet. The plan is to use the strongest one for 8 weeks, step down for two weeks and then step down to the lowest one for another two weeks
I've used the free nhs stop smoking service twice. The first one was brilliant. A group of about 20 people met at a local hall weekly. And we actually smoked for the first three weeks and just learned about quitting and got a plan....got prepared. Then boom we all quit! That was a champix quit for me but it didn't last long. But that team spirit really felt great.  Second time they changed the format and it was just a weekly drop in service where you'd get like 15 minutes one to one with a counsellor. And you could mix with other quitters waiting. That was still good but felt less of a team. Low and behold they shut for two weeks over Christmas!! And that was me back on the fags!    I really liked having that weekly meet and having someone check up on me. They measure your co2 and it was rewarding seeing that going down and down.       This time round I used the pharmacy service which isn't as good. They are not stop smoking counsellors. But I got my weekly meet, free NRT and they measured my co2. So still a very good service.      This wee bit of extra support will help you im sure Lily! I used the patches for about 3 - 4 weeks. I really found them awesome and they basically took away the urge. So all I had was 'time for a fag'...'oh no it's not, I dont smoke' thoughts!         I was really firm on not entertaining these thoughts. Don't torture yourself. I always said to myself don't let a thought turn into a crave. Just squash it, bat it away! Move on!!
    Good for you Lilly.....you can do it ....   Don't struggle ...slap a patch on ...give yourself every chance this time ....
    Thanks, Lilly.  I am glad @WeegieWoman is around,   she is a patch success story.       You don't smoke anymore.    Congratulations.
    Way to  "Nope" Lily!  Step by step you are getting this. 
    Keep a list of all the reasons you want to quit close to you all the time Lilly. On your phone or written on paper so you can pull that out and read them any time you have a smoking thought. Focusing on all the positives your are gaining by quitting and knowing that the only reason you don't already have those things is because of smoking might just help you readjust your thinking more quickly. See the positives - not the negatives  
Thanks so much everyone.        Not having the best day. Not quit wise but patch wise. After about half an hour my arm was so painful. The only way I can describe it is it feels like someone has been repeatedly punching me in the arm. I spent the first hour convincing myself I was about to have a heart attack   I bought some lower strength ones and will try them tomorrow to see if that makes any difference.      I'm doing my positive thinking Reci  That tip was a great one thank you.        I'm back at work tomorrow as can't stand another day stuck at home. I won't be able to post as much but will log in straight away from my phone if I'm struggling.   @WeegieWoman you've given me hope with the patches. The clinic I went to did my co2 reading, gave a bit of advice then gave me the NRT.  It's in a hall so met lots of other people quitting while I was waiting. Did you get any side effects?        I love you lot so much
    No negative side effects but my pal got really itchy skin from them. But he put up with that as they helped so much with stopping smoking!!         Where did you put it? I'm sure a weaker strength will ease your symptoms a bit. And you could maybe try a different part of your body? I generally always put them top outside of my arms but I've heard of people putting them all over the place!         I'd give it another day for sure and see how you get on. If your still struggling may need to think of an alternative. I was given patches and lozenges at the start of my quit.        Going back to work will only help your quit I reckon. And that's good you're fit enough to go back to work 
I put it at the top of my arm on outside. More or less where you would get an injection. They also gave a second NRT so I have a back up. I like the idea of the patches - slap it on in the morning and forget about it so hoping the lower strength is better.        I got given the inhalator too but trying not to use those unless I get really desperate.        I'm looking forward to work. I feel well I'm just a bit wiped out. They said I could feel like that for a few weeks so can't wait for that to pass.         Really appreciate hearing about your experience with the patch xEdited March 13 by Lilly
If the Step #1 patches are a problem maybe try to go back to the place you got them and discuss with them? They may have some suggestions for you including advise about starting with a lower dose patch. Just a suggestion.

I was working it out just now and each cigarette has 0.5mg of nicotine. Even smoking 30 a day I would have only been taking in 15mg so maybe it is just a lot more than my body is used to
     I agree...always check...this dose maybe too strong for you Lilly...    
Congratulations LilIy!!The research I have found is that most cigarettes delivers about 1mg of nicotine. But I think it depends on how you smoke. I don’t think the 21 mg patch is too much for you.I used the patch. It’s a long story but my father had them mailed to me. I started with a 21 mg and if I remember correctly used it for about six or seven weeks. I Always had two patches on at once, with one of them being 48 hours old.I smoked nearly 2 packs of cigarettes a day.     Move the patch around. Don’t ever put it in the same place twice. Hell, put it on your ass if you have to. I found that the shoulder blade area worked best for me.     Make it work!           Cigarettes do nothing for us. They take away our time, our money and our health.         https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&channel=iphone_bm&source=hp&ei=ZnKJXPWKLueI_QbntaegDw&q=+how+much+nicotine+is+in+one+cigarette+&oq=+how+much+nicotine+is+in+one+cigarette+&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-hp.3..0l8.4501.8759..9237...0.0..0.94.618.10......0....1.......8..41j0i131j46i275.xk1MRNN6pf0Edited March 13 by Octain
    Thanks Octain. I will try the shoulder blade area tomorrow and see how that goes. I've decided not to sleep with it tonight. I've taken it off, had a bath and have come to bed.        I've got through a whole day so despite the pain they obviously help 
    One day is miraculous!  We did whatever we had to do to get that cigarette. We walked in the snow, the rain, and the heat to get a cigarette. Why wouldn’t we use that same energy to stay away from them?  Pfft.  If I can do it, anyone can.
Fantastic work on day 1. It does sound like that patch is a bit much but they really do aggravate you I think. Can still work though and if you like the idea then why not. I'd maybe step down a patch though if you think it's too much.  Keep talking too. It's the information and education that stops us relapsing. I'm sorry to say it but we have a junkies brain and we have to get past it, so dig in and we've got you. Failure is not an option and all that. If you can do anything except smoke, that's a mighty big list of things to do. Maybe create an actual "distract my brain" list. Things you can do to swerve the thoughts. They are only thoughts. You already said you don't want to smoke and I know that's the truth of it. We all do. The problem is short term the nicotine addiction but that passes so quickly, like 72 hours without nicotine in your body (although using patches prolongs that but creates a safety feeling elsewhere-each to their own). But your bigger issue is your own junkie mind...telling you, we would smoke here.....hello...hello...we would smoke here. It's mentally uncomfortable but not damaging to tell your brain, hey thanks for the reminder but we quit, we don't smoke now. This message eventually replaces the old message and voila!    I know I'm further down the road but I don't ever forget the journey it took to get me here and I want you toknow 100%, there is nothing that would make me want to smoke now or ever, nothing. It controlled me and I never signed up to that. You will feel the same, I promise. Just persevere.  Much love. x
I really needed to read these posts tonight so thank you for all your great advice.         So today I went back to work. Obviously everyone who passed me stopped to check how I was. I told each and every one of them I had quit smoking. So the first guy I told just laughed and said you haven't quit smoking if you're wearing a patch. I'll come and congralute you when that comes off. I was a bit shocked but never said anything.       Seriously EVERY time someone spoke to me he would pipe up with his oh she hasn't quit yet as she's wearing a patch.         I asked him after an hour why he kept saying I hadn't quit and he said because you've still got nicotine going in all day.      I was there for 9 hours and this went on all day. I got in the car to come home, drove up the road then burst into tears. I feel really deflated and like he sucked every bit of positivity out of me.      I get that people have an opinion on NRT but I don't get why he just kept going on and on and on.       I'm 20 minutes away from completing another day so have come to my safe haven to see the people who get it
    Lilly....this is your quit ...and yours alone ...   Who cares what he thinks ...just let it go over your head ....Just ignore it.....   Some people just carnt,t help themselves....    One day at a time ...
    Lilly, it sounds like this guy is a total douche, pardon the expression. Next time he says "I'll come congratulate you when the patch comes off," respond with, "And I'll congratulate you when your attitude doesn't suck!"        You are doing great. Don't let one major douchebag ruin your quit for you!
    Thanks both of you. I don't know why I let him get to me but he did.        Douche has made me laugh. If he pipes up again tomorrow I'll just think of that and smile to myself x
    Well, first of all, he is a jerk (excuse me).  Some people get joy out of making you feel smaller than you are.  He should have been encouraging you for your efforts.      Lilly don't let anyone bring you down.  Remember, you are running that marathon and doing this for yourself and not anyone else.  Stay focused on the forum.  We know what you are experiencing.  There is nothing wrong with using NRT to attain your goal.  Hang tough.  I know you will make it.  
    Lilly, like the others said, who cares what that guy says! You are smoking, that's HUGE! Keep using your patch, it's working! And don't let anyone tell you differently!!!
    Yes! Don't listen to him. He knows nothing about quitting is my guess. Some people just look at the negative side of everything. If he's a smoker, I'm betting he wants to quit too and is jealous that you are brave enough to do it before he does.. You are taking a positive step - not a negative one. Let him be the one to eat crow at the end of the day

    I stayed mum about my quit,     I don't converse about personal stuff with many anyway. Don't much care to hear what the great haute monde or the hoi polloi has to say about my trip.  lol.        Just focus on YOU never putting a cigarette in your mouth again.    You will deal with your nicotine addiction.     At the end of the day, it IS all about putting the nicotine addiction to sleep.  
Ahhh the inevitable "voice of doom" in the background who is a know it all jerk, we've all seen them! I had it, from people online and in person because I was on champix. I will repeat my learnings, it takes 72 hours, yes just 3 days for nicotine to clear your body. It is the mental discomfort that is the fight really, not the getting rid of what the patch is replacing. I wil say though, I found the patch harder than not after a short while, but I know a lot of people who have quit in multiple ways. The key is educating yourself on the hows and why's you got addicted and why that means you need to break free now....then not putting anything in your mouth and setting fire to it.      Ps, I'm not above a little laxative powder in their coffee or lunch if they need teaching a little lesson

I do not have that really bad cravings anymore  .       One day i made a decision to kill the cravings with Nicotine gums alone .       And it has been working since the past 3 months     I mean every time i have a craving , I try to kill it with a nicotine gum .     The cravings could be there for the rest of my life , Let it be there , I do not care .     I have decided that the only thing i am going to feed my depressed mind is a nicotine gum and nothing else      Good luck staying smoke free

    I do not like reading your posts Sazerac to be honest .     You know why , because every one has a way to stop inhaling the smoke       You have not even figured that out , Lol        What do you think people come out of some factories ?
You repeatedly promote nicotine gum, not as a tool to help you quit nicotine but, as a lifestyle.   This is sad and unhelpful to people honestly dealing with nicotine addiction.       There is no wrong way to quit smoking and quit nicotine.Edited March 18 by Sazerac
It works for me , that is why i use it .        Why is that sort of so hard for you to understand ?     This nicotine gum exactly is the reason why i have not damaged my lungs with smoke since the past 3 months , Lol        You talk like you know it all , Lol     How does one ignore a profile in this forum ?
    Sazerac ignored , There i did it .      I feel better when i do not read your posts

    What facts ?        The fact that i use Nicotine gums so that i can stop inhaling smoke in my lungs ?
I Think the point that was trying to be made was .....Its easy to swop one addiction for another ....   The programme on gum should not last longer than 12 weeks ....same as any other NRT...
Patz, I do not understand why you are being confrontational.  That does not seem like you.  Believe it or not, people on this forum care about you.  You may have subdued your addition to smoking but you are still addicted to the nicotine.  Yes it is good not to have the smoke in your lungs but it is not good to have the nicotine in your body.  I just lost a friend to tongue cancer.    They were young like you and died very quickly. Most of us on the forum want you to be able to free yourself of your addiction and live a full, healthy life.        Edited March 18 by Linda Thomas
@Doreensfree , @Linda Thomas        Thanks for the reply        Sorry for the trouble .     Eating nicotine gums for me was the best way to stay away from the irritations of addiction .       Yes , Nicotine addiction is a strange irritation        Going cold turkey was not helping me much , I had to waste my time thinking about another 100 things to take my mind of the addiction that kept coming back .       But once i made Eating nicotine gums a habit , That strange irritation of addiction went away .     Nowadays i eat a pack of gums only every three or four days .       That is a big improvementEdited March 18 by Redemption3
    No one is attacking you R !!!they are trying to help... When ever..if and when you stop the gun ...you will still have to deal with withdrawal....the gum keeps you a junke to the addiction....    Unless you stay in the gum for life ....this is the fact ....

Redemption I'm really pleased for you that you have stopped smoking for 3 months. That really is a great achievement and you should be super proud.         With regards to NRT I have to disagree with you.  If you feel that taking NRT (possibly for life) is a good trade then you have mis-understood or don't get his addiction. That plan isn't a step forward it is a step sideways.        I have been using NRT for 6 days and my cravings have been pretty subdued. This isn't because my quit is going great, it's because I'm still giving myself nicotine. The theory with NRT is that you use it to get yourself past those first tricky days/weeks. It gives you a bit of time to get used to not smoking but then you have to deal with that physical withdrawal. NRT isn't a long term plan.      Sazerac isn't an NRT hater. She just believes it should come with a plan for coming off it.  I agree with her completely.       Anyway, I just logged in to tell you all that I'm struggling a bit today. I'm not going to smoke so no need for an SOS. I just feel a bit down, I keep getting those destructive thoughts creeping in and I'm exhausted. I'm not letting go of my end goal but it's consuming my thoughts from morning to night the last couple of days          Edited March 18 by Lilly
    Sorry you are having a tough day, Lilly.    Stay focused, you are building a strong quit    and we are behind you all the way.  Some days are just BAD, even in real life.      Soon, you won't have smoking or nicotine ruling your thoughts   and the sooner you can switch them up the better.   I know I waited far too long in purposefully replacing smokey thoughts with thoughts of beauty. Addiction really sucks  but, the recovery doesn't last forever, even though it seems like it at the time.   I promise, soon you will feel clean and clear and more confident and powerful than you can even imagine.    I promise.
    Thanks Saz.  I'm so emotional - I read your post and I burst into tears. I'm hanging on to every word and just praying for the worst to be over. I know it's early days I just wish this would pass.        It's so nice to come here and be around people who get it x
    Just keep telling yourself that this too shall pass Lilly, that's what I did. I hope your tomorrow is better 
If a person chooses to use the nicotine gum to quit smoking, it is irresponsible for anyone to advocate just "popping" a piece of gum whenever the craving hits. It is against this boards policy to support the use of nicotine as a replacement for smoking unless its use is to quit altogether.   Follow directions.  The Gum is a 12 week program.  The patch has a program as well.  Anything other than following the products directions is abusing the product and giving very poor advice.  You are only fooling yourself if you think you are not still addicted.        and one more thing.  Just sayin'......              NOPE is the way for me!
Thanks Jillar. I will definitely do that.       I actually feel a bit better being here.  It's really comforting xEdited March 18 by Lilly

    Lilly, I had some really sad days in the beginning.  I think we grieve the loss of smoking while we are quitting.  You are doing great and things will get better.  Stay close to the forum.  We are here for you!.
    Cigarette free and Nicotine free are two different things
    Thanks Linda.  The support here is so uplifting x
    Aw, Lilly, I know those down days are tough. Your emotions are all over the place in the beginning. I'm only just now starting to feel like I'm on a more even keel. But I'm so glad I was patient and didn't light up again! Hang in there. Please don't hesitate to send me a PM if you need a listening ear. I'm here for you!

This ^      I remember tears flowing in my early quit. I grieved the loss of cigarettes but more so I grieved for all the years I wasted believing I needed them. Believing I was ‘choosing’ to smoke when the reality was that I am an addict and the addiction was in charge.         Right now, you’re running low on dopamine because nicotine did the same job so you were not having to produce so much of your own. Your body will catch up and you will feel real joy without the crutch of cigarettes and IT IS WORTH IT. But that is a little further down the line. Don’t avoid the board while you’re sad. That is the best time to be here. Play the games, start a conversation, vent about the smoking or other life stuff that interferes. This place is perfect in these first months to distract you and reinforce your quit. It’s the place where you’re not alone and these people have walked your walk. You got this!
    I needed to hear that today.        I'm avoiding the board because I'm like a fiery ball of anger. I tore all the buttons of my shirt today because when I was ironing it I noticed a little pen mark on the sleeve. I had a fight with a pitta bread yesterday because the lettuce kept falling out.       I'm not going to smoke I just want to get past this part. It's like my quit has become groundhog day!!      Now I'm annoyed at myself for not being happy I haven't lit up. 
    Lilly, all those feelings are normal.  It is like your clawing to get to the other side.  There was about three weeks, during my quit, I did not think my husband would survive me.     Just know if you can keep going, it gets better each day.  Just keep hanging tough.     Don't not post.  We all understand because we have been there. I often found the humor on the forum got me through.  Give us the chance to help you through or make your smile.
    When you get frustrated and angry, go back to deep breathing. That and calming your mind are the best ways to relax and get "out of the moment". By the way, that's all normal. It will pass - just not as quickly as you'd like  
    Well I'm still going. Nobody is more surprised than me to be honest. I've not been happy at all but I've not once contemplated smoking. Today was Mother's Day and my children told me how proud they were of me not smoking  x
    It's a good feeling Lilly to have your kids proud of you ....This means a lot to me ...and keeps me motivated.... Well done ...
    Thanks Doreen xxx
    Lilly, I am so proud of you.  You are finally conquering the struggle.  I think you finally have this!  Keep that quit going. 
    Linda I wake up in the morning and I say I'm not smoking today but if I want to smoke tomorrow then I definitely will.      I think because I give myself the option it takes the pressure off a bit and obviously tomorrow never comes lol x
Oh hang on to that message, your kids being proud....if you do have an urge to smoke just remember how it felt when the kidlets told you they were proud of you.Edited March 31 by notsmokinjoKidneys are not kidlets...bloody auto correct.
    I am so glad you found something that worked.  I really think you have it this time.  You are only going to get more stronger and powerful.

    So it doesn't matter what stage of our quit we are in we are going to face triggers to wanting a smoke. The earlier you are in your quit the more triggers you will face and you will be surprised how many things you will learn were triggers and you didn't even know. So first rule of triggers avoidance... don't expect your triggers to be concurred over night, it took time to program your brain with all your smoking triggers its going to take time to unprogram them.     The first few days of quitting are often the most challenging. You’re likely to have strong regular cravings due to nicotine withdrawal and also from smoking triggers. Being prepared and knowing what to expect can make things easier. As each day passes the cravings occur less and less often. They grow weaker until you’re not thinking of smoking for days, then weeks, then months at a time. You just need to beat the triggers, outsmart the little buggers, and beat them into oblivion one by one.        Triggers are all those little habits, experiences, situations and feelings that you have learnt to associate with having a smoke. Some can just be avoided but some can't.      So change your routine.... I used to get up, fill the kettle and put it on as I went outside for my first hit... every morning it was the same thing....didn't matter if I needed the loo.... nothing happened before that first smoke.... so I switched it up... get up, go to the dunny, have a shower, then a coffee.... I changed the pattern, and the trigger lost its strength and went away. The whole first year was a master class in avoiding triggers, re-writing them, and deleting them from my mind. Everyone who quits faces triggers, some are the same, some are different.... so oldies and inbetweenies share you tricks of the trade with our newbies... how did you deal with your triggers.       Here are some tips from the quit people down under:  
    Great post Jo.!!!!  Change your routine ... Change your thoughts to positives ..instead of negatives .....

Once I saw that, it was so much easier to deal with triggers, or to respond in different ways other than lightening up.            Example, from back in october. At that point I thought I was done with morning triggers: 'Started with the SAD (seasonal affective disorder)  lamp this morning,  third year in a row﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿. Made myself a nice coffee and had some papers ready, to prepare for today. So I am sitting behind this absurdly bright light an﻿d suddenly this intense crave hits me... omg!!! In a flash I see myself lighting up, immediately having that 'Ahhhhh'moment﻿, so at first I'm all 'wtf is this, where does this come from, oh nooo'. Panick, 'Will this ever st....'﻿   And then it dawns on me. The lamp is HEAVILY connected with morning smoking rituals. Waking ﻿up, coffee, lamp, one or two cigarettes (the only ones﻿during all seasons I allowed myself to smoke IN the house,  as to ease and boost myself for REALLY doing this lamp thing, waddajamean fvcking up my reward system), and I kidd you not, the crave eases out the second I understand  the connection.    Knowing this intens 'wanting' is nothing more than a brainfart, a result of programming. Knowing that here and now, in this moment, I cut yet another tie with this darned addiction!      My tip would be to try to remove the emotional aspect of triggers, try to detach from that. Ofcourse, cry if you need to, because of the sudden surprise, or scare maybe. And after that comes healing. Each time a little bit more.         Edited March 26 by MLMR
    Great post Jo, thanks!  
    There is a saying-      "There is no extra credit for making quitting harder."      I avoided places where I would smoke for the first few months of my quit.
    I walked away from my husband if I thought an argument was brewing, as that was always a green light to go and smoke.   I refused to let myself get worked up to the point I knew I would be checking my purse to see if i had enough for a pack!               Great post Jo..Thank you.   
    I also tried changing my routine but the biggest thing I always did when a trigger hit was to identify all the circumstances around the trigger to identify and to learn so that I could handle them.  Also I had to learn the the farther into the quit the more "out of left field" that the triggers came from and that triggers come from anywhere.  Learn to live with them and to conquer them -- it gets easier!!!!
    If a big trigger happens to be excitement, maybe pester a room mate instead. Or aggravate the neighbor's dogs.      Yeah, my biggest emotional trigger is when I get excited, say like finding some awesome deal on ebay

Excellent post Jo as usual.     I always, always ask my trigger ( I actually have a mental conversation with it :p) what does it need? My attention on a memory? My celebration for something good? My anger on something wrong? Anxiety at work?Post the answer my trigger gives, I'm like, hmm and where would that be after the 7 minutes of puffing like a defunct coal engine? Nowhere so how about instead I give you a nice walk, or a cool drink (It's hotter than a pig's backside here right now) and by that time, my trigger has left the building.
    I love this Tammie. It’s actually enlightening listening to our minds trying to tell us something we always deadened it with cigs buts it’s actually something to be heard. Every day is a learning day
    Jo thank you for such a helpful post.       I always remember Jillar saying don't smoke in places you usually smoke before you quit. I stopped smoking in the car, at my smoking spot in the garden and my work grounds. I didn't find new regular spots, I smoked in completely different spots each time so none became habitual.         This really helped break associations before I'd even quit. 
    I'm being sent to a pulmonologist. My autoimmune disease is attacking my lungs. I can't breathe properly. I find myself gasping for breath during conversations. The other night my lungs were burning as if I'd sprinted up a hill, and all I was doing was sitting on my arse watching television. I feel like I can never get quite enough air. It's a truly terrifying feeling.     Please don't smoke. If you have quit, STAY quit. Keep that precious quit at all costs. If you are still smoking and thinking of quitting, do it now. Don't wait until you reach the point of no return. Your lungs are precious, and every breath is a gift.
    abby so sorry to read that you are having such a hard time. I am new here and don't know much about your quit but being a long time smoker myself I can feel the damage I have done to myself. I hope you find some relief from all that you are going through. My thoughts are with you. 
    Oh, abby !  I am so sorry you are going through this.   I can only imagine the panic you must feel.     Thank you for your posts, you help all of us everyday.  We have taken our breath for granted and are stupid.    Breath is the most important part of our survival.      Keep us posted.  Hopefully the pulmonologist will be able to alleviate your distress.
    Abby, I wish I had something insightful or at least helpful to add to the conversation.     That not being an option, I send you my best wishes and hope you're doing better soon.      Take care.
    I know how it feels to not be able to breathe Abby. Some of what you are going through could be your lungs cleaning out all the gunk from smoking. I remember when I first quit that my breathing got worse than when I smoked. So much so that I thought, why did I even quit! I do have asthma too though and it seemed quitting made it worse But my pulmonologist told me that my lungs were actually starting to repair themselves. Hopefully your pulmonologist will be able to assure you that's the case for you too and also give you something to help with your breathing. 
    Sorry you are experiencing this Abby. Frightening I'm sure but glad to hear your are going to see the pulmonologist. That's the Dr. that will be able to give you the best status report and treatment plan for your lung function. Will be thinking of you and hoping you get good results. Please keep us informed .... we care 
    Oh Abby, so sorry to hear this.  Please know I will be praying for you.  Please try to keep positive thoughts and concentrate on healing.   Please keep in touch.   Linda
    Ugh, that must be so scary. Sorry you are going through this.       Thanks for taking the time to write this down.. these are the messages that keep reminding me to do everything in my power to protect my quit.      Whishing you well, hope there's treatment for this ugly part of your autoimmune disease.        Take care!       
    I mirror all the above .... Hopefully with time ..the longer you stay quit ..the damage can be repaired ....take care Abby...
    Abby, so sorry that you're having to deal with this.  Being this is caused from an autoimmune disease, are they able to stop any of this?  Thanks for the wise words and the great reminder.
    I’m so glad you’re going to see a pulmonologist.  I hope you get some answers and relief.  Please keep us posted. 
    I too am glad you are going to see a pulmonologist, hopefully the doctor will be able to help you and find some answers.  I too have felt how bad my lungs have been damaged and it can be a roller coaster of a ride but my doctor has been helping me.  Good luck and keep us posted!!!!!
Not breathing or struggling too is a horrible feeling. After smoking close to 40 years it’s a wonder I can breathe at all. Our bodies must be tougher than we give it credit for. I hope they get you taken care of sooner than later. I just didn’t think it made any sense that you could quit smoking and breathe worse than what did while smoking.  I think that is one reason it’s been somewhat difficult for me of late. Best wishes Abby.

There are immunosuppressive treatments that can help stop my body from attacking my lungs, but unfortunately those drugs attack the liver.

I will keep everyone posted.        Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement. I appreciate you all so much. ❤
    Just want to add my best wishes  for a quick, positive turnaround. Hopefully this is a temporary setback and you'll get some relief and be back on track very soon.  Your strength and amazing attitude will get you through this and we will be cheering you on every step of the way.

Hi Abby, just checking in to see how you are doing.  Have you seen the pulmonologist yet?  Hopefully they are figuring things out and getting you on the road to recovery.  Wishing you the very best and hoping that you're getting some relief from your symptoms. Edited March 26 by Jordan7
@Jordan7 Thank you for checking in! I have an appointment to see the pulmonologist on May 8. I'll keep everyone posted as to what I find out.       Right now I'm dealing with a nasty cold. Been in bed for a few days. I'm just so glad I don't smoke anymore! I can't believe I used to try to smoke when I was sick! Ugh!
    Hope you feel better soon Abby, xoxo. I used to gauge how sick I still was by how my cigarette tasted!
Well Abby at least you have been smoke free for almost 3 months -- that should help you with the cold that you have.  Glad you have the doctors appointment  you take it easy now and get better!!!!

    Hope you kick that cold soon.  Not what you needed, but hopefully it will be over soon.  Any chance you can get on a waiting list for an earlier pulmo appointment if they have a cancellation?
    I swear by this ...much easier than yoga....    I was introduced to this Chinese art very early in my quit ....its very relaxing and good for the mind and soul.....    You can follow it on  you tube ...try the beginners .....   I do a excersise every day ...       
    Great stuff Doreen! Going to give it a shot. Did some yoga years ago and I like this. Still looking for a warm and comfortable place though!
Doreen and I were talking, and realized our husbands are the same age, 66.  That is about the only thing they have in common.  I am going to tell you first about my husband, Dennis, and then Doreen will be along to tell you about Tony. Hopefully there are smokers who will read this who still have the opportunity to choose which husband and father they would like to be. Dennis is a never smoker.  At 66, he still works 40 hours a week.  He enjoys golf, and boating.  He maintains our home and houseboat.  As many of you know, this past year he and his 70 year old brother totally remodeled the upstairs of our home. They took the kitchen down to the studs and rebuilt (and Dennis was still working 40 hours each week).  Dennis recently walked his oldest daughter down the aisle with pride.  He loves life and has a wonderful laugh.  He takes medicine to control blood pressure and cholesterol, but is in great health otherwise.    Doreen will tell you about Tony, soon.
I carnt post pictures, but I'm sure Tony would not want you all to see how sick he looks...Tony has end stage emphysema... He smoked until he physically couldn't put a cigarette in his mouth and smoke it..It takes all the strength and breath he has ..to just get out of bed in the morning...with my help...After a rest...he needs my help to wash...shave..Chair lift gets him downstairs...gets settled in a chair..where he stays till we have a bedtime routine.Emergency ambulances ,and hospital is never too far away...lung infections are almost on going..Doctors fight to keep pneumonia at bay...Because his blood doesn't retain oxygen...he needs a machine 16 hours a day....Sleeping with the mask on and the machine going all night is only half of it...Tony relies on me for everything...as sooon as he tries to move ...he is breathless...I have watched him the last 14 years slowly get worse ,this is a very cruel illness.I have shortened this thread...I could write a book...Tony and I don't know just how bad this will get...we live our lives on a daily basis..If you are out there reading this...wanting to quit...please do it now..I thank Nancy ....brilliant idea..
This is very moving...thank you for sharing-Nat
Now tell them about your boyfriends.....
This is very moving...thank you for sharing-Nat Thanks, NatalieNow tell them about your boyfriends.....Everyone already knows all about you...
Goodness me Doreen just goes to show doesn't it? I only hope those thinking of quitting read that, don't brush it off as 'well it won't happen to me' because as your poor Tony has sadly found, it could and does. Thank goodness you stopped Doreen!
This is a very powerful post.  Thank you both for sharing.  I pray the message in this post is taken to heart by all who continue to smoke.  This is reality folks.  Smoking doesn't help you with stress & it's not your friend.  Smoking only makes you sick and anything you tell yourself to the contrary is just the addict talking.
Doreen and Namcy. Such a hard hitting post. Dorren, the sheer and utter madness of it is that even though he refused to quit smoking, eventually he couldn't physically smoke and he quit anyway! After all the pain and the hardship and suffering. Denial and refusal. The excuses and all that we all have done. He quit anyway.  I wonder does he miss smoking or wish he quit earlier?  Does he feel the same way you do now?  I'm so very very sorry for your situation. For both of you. But for a strange day in October 2015, I could be Tony 30 years down the line. Any one of us could. I think I thought I might be. When I allow myself to dwell on the insanity of smoking, the industry, the lies, the excuses we allow purses to make....... It's so..........pointless. My heart goes out to you. I'm glad you quit and have got healthier.  Nancy, I'm glad you were able to quit and join your husband in a shared future.  Thank you both for sharing your stories. X
PP..when tony first had his  diagnosis ....he was very much in denial....his head was firmly in the sand...His addiction took away any fear of what this illness entailed...He doesn't miss smoking now....he has more important things to think about....taking each breath....Our Xmas was shared with a lung team ,that came to see him every day...to try and keep him home for Xmas...I am so grateful ,relieved,happy....that I quit before the s***t hit the fan for me....I was so close....Never stick anything in your mouth ....and set fire to it....If anyone out there is reading this...that wants to quit....do it today....For those who have already quit....never doubt ....never miss it....Because your health is something you will miss more....if you lose it....trust me....I know..
Wow. Beautifully done ladies. My Dad was 59. The operation on the aneurysm went well.  Unfortunately smoking had reduced his lung capacity to the extent that they could not get him off the respirator. He caught an infection.  He never woke up.

So sad Stuart....so young....I'm sorry...
Tragic...I know it still hurts....thank you for sharing.  So sad Stuart....so young....I'm sorry...  Thank you ladies. Just the way it is. The cigarettes don't care how old you are, who you are or what you have done. They kill you just as dead. Good news for anyone reading this is that you CAN quit. It is very doable.
wow- very powerful,,,  I am sorry for you,, and I love you all, I done even need to see you,, That's just how it is- I have lost people,,  and I have found you,, for everything we get,,, we give up something,,,, I truly believe- Thank you my quit train friends,,,,, for being,, RC

P..D.....Quitting may for some be uncomfortable for a while...but lung desease is far more uncomfortable..Congrats to all here...xx

Loads of Brackets D.
Doreen-I'm so sorry you and your husband are going through this terrible time.  Thank both you and Nancy for this post. I'm still early in my quit, which has been reeaaaalllllllyyyyyy difficult for me. I'm going through a stressful time and just tonight was thinking I wish I had just one.  If I did, I could go outside, by myself and escape for a few minutes. But your tales have reminded me why I am working SO hard to stay quit. So, thank you for that. (And thankfully, all nicotine products have been removed from the house and I'm not craving enough to drive to the gas station because tonight could have easily turned into a slip for me).  Nancy- As a side note, where do you keep your houseboat?  We have friends who have a houseboat on Norris Lake and it's one of our favorite places to visit. 
I'm also saddened and sorry for Doreen and her husband. But when I see replies like I can do this, above me, I'm thankful for her strength in posting this, because I know how much it will help people, even if most of them never tell us. I can do this - you're doing amazingly! Whatever you're facing, face it down, and let your resolve grow even stronger. 
Thank you Nancy and Doreen for sharing.Cigarettes killed many in my family.  I thought they would end me too.
Time for a update...for those sitting on the fence...for those struggling and romancing the smoke...Those who know me well..know my story... If your new ...please take the time to read...it just might save your quit...OkTony went for his oxygen lever test today..to make sure the oxygen machines at home are set at the right setting..This is a very painful thing to have done...the out a needle in your wrist just abokve the top side of your hand..He cries out in pain...they take blood and test it...i find this hard enough to watch..i casn only imagine the pain involved..it turned out the 16 hours of oxygen on setting 4 is OK for now...The carers still come in every day...but they have cut his showers down...as it totally takes his breath away ,and he struggles to breath...He has been on two courses of antibiotics and steroids since the last couple of months..This is why our daughter has travelled  half around the world ...to nurse  her dad ,while I had 5 days away...This is what smoking does...Please....don't smoke....
Doreen, that really drives the point home concerning the way cigarettes destroy our health.  I know it must be difficult, but thank you for sharing your story. Best wishes to you, Tony, and your daughter.
Oh Doreen. Your story breaks my heart. Such wasted opportunity. I'm sorry you and Your husband have to suffer through this.
As sad as Tony condition is...thats not the reason I came to the board although it should have been..No my lungs were OK...I can breath OK...I havnt got c.o.p.d...so why should I quit...(numpty addict )...Something else sinister was happening to me...my blood was clotting around my ankles cutting off the blood flow..I just happened to be at the docs...hey take a look at my black ankles...Doc....do you smoke...Me....yes for 52 years...Doc...if you don't stop now...you will lose your feet for sure...This is what brought me to the board for support...The damage is not always obvious....Just take a minute to imagine...the nightmare our lives would have been ...Never take another puff....never....
Always in my thoughts and heart you guys. xx
Powerful stuff Doreen.  Glad you quit.  Glad you're here on the Train with the rest of us numpty addicts.
Doreen, My heart is with you! I'm pretty new here and am only on day 5 of no nicotine and this was such a heart felt post. I really respect you and respect your decision to share such an emotional part of your life. Thank you =)
Doreen, My heart is with you! I'm pretty new here and am only on day 5 of no nicotine and this was such a heart felt post. I really respect you and respect your decision to share such an emotional part of your life. Thank you =)Thank you...you fight for your quit...your life depends on it...It may be uncomfortable at the beginning...but so worth it...Post ,post... You will have support all the way...This is a very small support site to others...but this little family truly cares for each other..xx
Thank you Nancy and Doreen for starting this powerful post.I am very grateful to you both and to everyone posting.Truths like these help keep me Free.S
Bumping this...for mom...and anyone who doesn't understand copd /emphysema..Husband ?...wife ?...emphysema doesn't care ...the effects are the same....
Thank you for sharing this Doreen...yes, very powerful stuff and my heart goes out to you and your husband. I want to share your story with my mother. She has emphysema, diagnosed a few years ago. She is in major denial. Still smoking and blaming her awful coughs on "the weather, a chest cold" etc. it is already getting bad and she is on steroid inhalers, etc. but refuses to quit smoking. Reading your story, I kept picturing every detail you described, happening to my mother, and it made me cry. So sad. How to make her understand what will happen? Maybe I can't, but I want her to know what others are going through with this, thank you for sharing the truth and how it has affected your life.
Tony was in denial too brandy...he smoked until he physically couldn't smoke...He didn't need all the warnings...very sad xx
Tony didn't quit cigarettes.  Cigarettes quit Tony.   ...and only when they were "done" with him. 
I'm sorry, no words, just a big motivation. 
Tony didn't quit cigarettes.  Cigarettes quit Tony.   ...and only when they were "done" with him. This is so true..                 
Nancy has asked for a update ...We seem to be in a regular routine now,a couple of weeks without antibiotics and steroids, and then one week blast course..a continuous cough...just have to recognise when the cough could turn in to a infection..Keep infections and pneumonia at bay,is a daily battle...The lung  specialist can do no more...it's all about making him comfortable ..if he was younger and not as sick ,they could have took a lot of his right lung away...but it's gone past this stage..The c.o.p.d nurses are trying him with a volumer..a glass tube..which you breath your inhaler from..to see if it helps...He is at risk of going into hospital again..Of course this has also took its toll on me..its a constant battle...C.O.P.d / emphysema... This is a very cruel illness...that very slowly Robs you of your life..it leaves you with no dignity..All you have left is doctors,hospitals,carers,Don't even risk this happening  to you and your loved ones..If we had understood this terrible illness...it might have made all the difference..Knowledge...learn about this illness..understand it.And quit and stay quit.All my best xx
Doreen, I hate what you and Tony are going through, but your story and the bravery to share it make a powerful statement. If you are reading this and still wavering about quitting, stop it.  Education, commitment, and support will allow you to set yourself free from this dreadful addiction.  You will never regret quitting, but if you continue smoking you may be left with little more than regret. Today is the perfect day to quit.
Oh, Doreen,Emphysema is such a gruesome way to go and not just for the patient.You are a hero being a carer and this must just rip you up.It rips me up knowing you. Smoking and nicotine addiction is complete selfishness.We don't comprehend our loved ones having to care for us, having to watch and listen to us slowly suffocate.It is a horrible REALITY. Smokers, do you have children ?  wives,  husbands ?  friends ?We all have to die but, why are you choosing painful, ugly death ?You'll be the lucky one on pain meds while your family takes care of you, listens to you gasping, coughing.  Listening for the 'rattle'.Then, you'll be the lucky one, DEADwhile your family recovers from the horror you put them through. Please quit.  It isn't hard.  It won't kill you.  
Thank you friends..for your never ending support..it helps me so much through the bad times..xxx
Thinking of you and sad that we didn't see the light sooner, all of us and those we love. x
Nancy and I have agreed to post a update here..Tony,s physical health is stil how it was..he still depends on me for all his needs..We are now worried about his mental health...he has lost interest...sometimes it's a battle...he carnt be bothered,Everything is too much effort..,so this brings agitation on both sides..If I mention resbite..to give me a rest ..he gets upset..he wants to stay with me...We have been married 46 years..and have never been apart..so i can understand...But it's so hard...C.O.P.D.,/ emphysema... You can live for years suffering ...If posting this thread helps that one person from relapsing ,or helps you decide to quit..This is what i intended...This is what smoking does..don't let it be you xxI'm sure Nancy will update ,when she can..
>Wipes tear away and clears throat Thank you for the courage it took to share with us.  
My heart breaks for you and Tony, dear friend.  It is horrible what the addiction has done to your family. Since I last updated on Dennis, he has retired.  He is still in excellent health, and is now helping his brother remodel his home.
Thank you sweetheart..Good to hear Dennis is enjoying his retirement..and when it's your turn to retire too,you will have happy times together ..that's the way it should be..xxxx
So very touching and personal thank you for sharing because it is very important for us all to understand the end results of this evil habit. Will keep you in my prayers.
I have nothing to add here that others haven't already said to you Doreen. I do want to thank you for sharing your terrible journey and please do keep this one updated for newbies like me. I just read the whole thing today and it does have a profound affect on those of us who are just starting out in our new smoke free lives - it does help us!Lots of love to you my dear - you're a very special lady  :wub:   
Thank you for your kind words...R if it makes your fight here stronger..I'm happy to keep it going...It's helping good folk like yourself...kick this dreadful addiction for good..
Time for a another update...    Been up all night again....Tony,s health took a nose dive...his blood is not holding a steady rate of oxygen ,if fell to 80 /%. This causes all kinds of problems.. Which can lead to cardiac....confusion... Tired....feeling all together unwell  He also is on the verge of any bout of phuomonia... So needs a whack of antibiotics.... Every time he gets phuomonia ,it weakens his lungs further....  Emphysema is not good  in extreme weathers....so this spell of extreme heat will not help....   So after doctors advice....he was taken to hospital by ambulance... Just when you think..yep.... Things are pretty crap just now...we have been thrown a huge spanner in the works...   He has recently been diagnosed with Vascular Dementia.... And is undergoing test to see exactly which part of the brain has been effected...    We already more or less know....it's the I don't care about anything part...which is found in the frontal area....but tests will proove this... Of course this will progress too....        If any one here is pondering whether they are doing the right thing...and miss a smoke....please read this thread from the beginning..  It's not just your life that gets ruined...your partner and your family suffer too....  Until next time.    KTQ....

    Oh Mammy my thoughts are with you both.     I'm sorry that you both have to go through this but I am thankful that you are sharing your experience because people really do need to know. Emphysema is an insidious disease and its effects on those with it and those surrounding them is horrifying.  I really hope that this serves as a "wake-up call" to anyone that nicotine is tempting and to those who are on the fence about quitting. 
    Damn. Doreen keep strong. Best wishes 
    Doreen, not much I can say other than thank you for having the strength to share this. Sending my love and best wishes. 
    I'm really sorry Doreen, i'll be thinking positive thoughts for you and Tony....  
    Thank you lovely peeps....  You guys keep me going ....I know I can come here...and find something to laugh about...even if it's laughing at myself ....    It's nice to know...friends are always at the end of pushing a few buttons...xxxxx
    Hi doreen, i was thinking, thats good you can still have a sense of humour throughout bad times. But i thought that might be inappropriate for me to say. But since you said it, thats great doreen. I cant begin to imagine what you are going through but glad you can still have a laugh somehow. Keep us posted and lets keep having a laugh too xx
    My love from Canada D! So sorry both of you are going through this. Wish we could do more to assist in some way.    If there were time travel, you'd be surrounded by kind, giving souls  Keep us updated please and take good care of yourself too.
    Doreensfree,        I appreciate the updates, It aids my resolve.       Can't say that's much of a consolation...my thanks.      
    I am sending you hugs, Doreen. I wish I could do more.
    For those who may not have seen...Doreen, never to cause you pain...just to help others
    Aww ..no worries Nancy ...glad you dug this up ...time for another update ...   Well you wouldn't have thought things could get much worse ..but of course they can .   A short while ago Tony was diagnosed with Alziemers/ Vascular Dementia.... This sent me in a spin for sure..... They have placed him in Middle stage ...i have been informed because of all his other illnesses and Emphysema... He will deteriorate much quicker ...   Who knows what our future holds....One day at a time ....

    I'm so sad to read this @Doreensfree,  I hope you find some comfort in knowing how much you're loved....xoxo
    It blows my mind how much pain and suffering is caused by nicotine. Thank you for everything you do and everything you are, my friend.
    So sorry to read your story Doreen. you and Tony are in my thoughts.    Take good care of you Doreen. I know first hand what looking after someone with mixed dementia is like. Very hard indeed. I looked after my Mother in law until she went into a home.   Take care x
    Doreen sending you and your husband lots of well wishes.        Thank you for being here and for giving us your time x
Sorry to hear of the latest news, Doreen ....very sad for you both. My thoughts are with you as you continue being the strong woman you are in caring for your husband, Tony, and doing what you do here in caring about all of us in our quit journeys. Simply amazing! Edited March 23 by Rozukigrammar? run on sentences? :)
    Oh Doreen, you are such a rock.  Not only do you care for all of us, you are caring for your husband.  I am familiar with what you are going through, our neighbor, living across the street, has the vascular dementia.  He also was a smoker, had lung cancer, went through radiation and then was diagnosed with the vascular dementia.      I so wish I lived close that I could be there for you.  Know that we are here to offer our prayers and be here to listen.  I so admire your strength and have been so honored to have you help me along my journey. Much love to you,   Linda
    Aww Thank you ...   I would never got through all this ,if it wasn't for my  Quit Train Friends...xx
Ok so I was so ashamed and was going to delete my account and hide forever and then I realised I really need your help and advice and I need to be accountable for my actions. So I’ll bore you with a little of my background. Hubby and I both smoke and both quit at the same time. This can be both supportive but also can be destructive as one of us will sabotage our quit and we know which buttons to press to achieve this. We also only smoke at home which means that we can go without smoking for periods of time and will wait to satisfy the addiction.    So the trigger this time was stress. I am in Christchurch and had one teenager in lockdown at school ( 5 minutes) from the shooting and another in lockdown at the nearby mall. Hubby bought the smokes but I didn’t hesitate to smoke one. It didn’t solve anything and it certainly didn’t help any of the families and didn’t get rid of the deep sadness I feel right now. We had to finish the packet being the true addicts which we are. So been back on the train for 2 days. Nope
Welcome back DizzyD - you were missed!  I can't tell you how deeply saddened we all were to hear of the tragedy in Christchurch. That was horrible and to have gone through what you did was something none of us would have wanted to go through. You have both learned a lesson about your addiction though by going through what you have - smoking makes NOTHING better, only make things worse. Carry that lesson forward and let us support you through your new, permanent quit. I understand why you feel bad about falling off the train but don't dwell on that. Just see it as a learning experience. What counts is that you keep at it until you find your freedom.        We're still here to support you. Let us give you a hand to board the train again             Edited March 20 by reciprocity
    So pleased you didn't delete your account here...and came back...   I'm sorry you have had to endure this horrendous act of cowardly action first hand ...my thoughts with everyone involved....    Take your seat D....buckle up.....your amongst friends here....who will support as best we can ...hugs x
If at first you don't succeed, try again! I'd guess 99% of us here did not manage to quit first time so we understand. Welcome back         You must have been terrified, I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
    Hi Dizzy        So you got off the train at the station and stretched your legs but you got back on the train before it left the station.       Sorry you lost your quit but congrats on requiting.     It just shows that no matter what the circumstances having a cig is never a help and that there is no such thing as just one for us addicts.         
    Welcome back! You have nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about regarding the relapse.  You’ve acknowledged it, time to move on.          Thank goodness your family is physically safe. The mental damage will take much time to heal if it ever does.  I’m broken hearted over the tragedy in Christchurch.  I’m so sad for NZ-heck- for all of us! 
    Welcome back DD. Don't dwell on the lost quit... its gone now, save your energy to focus on this quit, lets make it the forever one.        I'm sorry you were caught up in Fridays terror. Keeping you all in my thoughts and prayers.
    What a nightmare you lived through, Dizz.  I'm so glad you're safe and decided to come back. Good for you for jumping right back into quitting, and I believe you're going to make it stick this time. 
    So very sorry about the latest Terror.  It is all too sad.  Nicotine addiction is a fierce foe and you needn't feel shame or embarrassment over struggling with it. We are on your side and you will build a successful quick of this I have no doubt.   Please take very good care of yourself and hug your children extra tight.
    That must have been so scary for your family dizzyd. I'm glad your family is ok. And I'm glad you didn't delete your account! Congratulations on getting back on your quit. Remember that you are quitting for yourself first and foremost so if hubby buys another pack of cigarettes let him blow his own quit, not yours too.    Smokers love a "partner in crime" so your refusing to smoke any that he may buy will probably help him realize he can quit and stay quit too...
    Glad you are back dizzy and that you did not delete the account.  At least you committed to quit again and that is important.  My heart goes out to all of you in New Zealand -- It must be horrifying to go thru something like that.  Anyway take your place back on the train and know we will be behind you!!!
    Hi Dizzy and welcome back. I am so sorry for all you have been through. I too was ready to not come back. So glad I did. Only advise I can offer being so new here is stick around and if need be post an SOS if things get tough. These wonderful people saved my quit the other day. Had coat on and was ready to walk out the door and felt embarrassed to sos. But I did and it worked. So happy we are going to ride this journey together.     
    We are so glad to see you both back....we are a family....I'm proud of you both !!!!

    Doh ... Smoking is not an option. 
There's something that's bothering me for some time now and that is the grave importance of, well, EVERYTHING, since I quit. Its like I became 10 times as serious. I think I used to be more fun to be around.     All the reading and studying, Im pretty fed up with it, to be honest. I want my humor back, my non-planning, my go-with-the-flow and ... pretty much, my old me but without the smoking ofcourse. Let it be clear, i dont miss that for one second.     Do people recognize this and if so, when and how did you settle that?
    It'll pass MLMR, it's that first year quit thing and learning to adjust to our new normal. Once that first year hurdle is crossed you'll probably be able to relax and have fun much more easily  
MLMR I agree with Jillar above.  I went thru the same thing during my quit especially the 6-8 month part of it.  I started coming out the down and out and no fun type of thing in the autumn when I really began to notice all the benefits of no longer smoking one day when I was on the front porch and realized that I could smell all the things that make up the seasons.  From that point on I started getting used to "the new normal" and since then have been getting back to the new normal.  The first year you will see many changes and in the end you will be proud and glad that you did quit.!!!!!Edited March 20 by Martian5
    It's all Temporary.... I used to worry my personality had changed...gradually it can back ....  We spent years, decades feeding our bodies poisions..... It takes time to adjust ...    Doing over think things ....you are where you need to be ,just now ...look at the positives .....your free on nicotine at last ...
    You are building the foundation to a really wonderful life as well as a nicotine free one.  There will still be some growing pains but nothing radical. Just like everybody said, you will get to know the new you and you will just be a deeper, kinder spirit. Your capacity for fun will evolve, do not worry.
Of course everything is more important/serious now that our shutdown mechanism is gone. Go ahead and just dig on all the formerly unseen/ignored things now dancing in the forefront of consciousness. Quitting smoking really is a big deal, and so is this life. Just say wow.Edited March 20 by comrade simba
    How is our Chicklette doing ?????   We missing you .!!!!.....   Pop in soon ...we worry....!!!!!
    I woke up thinking the same thing. Check in @Icanhike, we worry.......
    I agree.  I hope all is well.       Hope so hear from you soon @Icanhike
    Also hope @DizzyD and @kallisonmk check in soon as well.    We're a bit like mother hens here when it comes to new quitters. We get worried when you stray too far from home  
    I hope her ribs are ok.         Come back soon 
    Thinking of you ICH..... Hope all is well with you and the family. 
@Icanhike! It's so good to see you, we were all so worried. How are you?
    Oh my Heavens, you guys are spectacular!   You have hearts of gold!   Every day, I've been meaning to get online, but a weird thing happened.  I woke up one morning with a phenomenal burst of energy, and I've been doing chores and projects like a madwoman for a week straight.  And at the end of the day, I sit on the couch and turn on my computer, but I'm so wiped out I fall asleep immediately.  I'm finally burning out, and sick of sleeping on the couch.   I'm suddenly looking back at my life, which was spent smoking,  and sorry that I missed out on the rewards of being productive.  And my aching lung is getting better every day;  it seems to have been from the injury when I fell.  But it scared me so much that I've been on a major health kick, no more junk food.  Sooooo, that's the update.  I hope you're all doing well, and a thousand "thank you's" for thinking of me!!!   hugs
    Thanks for the update icanhike, and I'm glad you're lung is getting better 
    Glad to see you back with your quit still intact  
    Yaaaaa.....nice to see you chick....    You have kept your fabulous quit ...and got a spotless house too....well done !!!!
    I just love this whole thread....that's what it's all about!

    Hi Icanhike and thanks for your update. New here and was so encouraged by your post. Always glad to read when someone a bit further along in their quit is doing so well. Keeps me motivated. 
Many will cough more after quitting,    here is our friend, Joel Spitzer, explaining why.Why Many People Cough More After Quitting      Video discusses cilia repair that occurs after quitting which often results in an increase in coughing  and he has a lot of links on Cilia repair, etc.Edited March 19 by Sazerac
Hubby quit!!!!!! Was three weeks Thursday!!!! And........I am still alive He did a patch for 4 days, nrt gum for 2 weeks.....I am so HAPPY!
    Great news, you stand as the role model and showing him how it could be done.   Congrats and happy for you and the hubby!!!
    Congratulations to you and your husband.        The freedom is contagious.
    That's great news Parsley! Having both of you quit is fabulous. You'll be able to give him a lot of tips on how to deal with things too because you've already been there; done that!
That's fantastic parsley! I'm really happy for you  Tell hubby congratulations from the gang on the train Edited March 18 by jillar
    Great news, so good to be free together 
    That is awesome, Parsley!  Congratulations to both of you!
    What happy news, Parsley !   
    Congrats!
    Brilliant news ...  Well done MR Parsley ...

    Craves coming one after another. Doing deep breathing, pacing and just feeling rotten. Went from energetic to feeling just beat. Getting a minor throbbing sinus headachey feeling with a drippy nose. Could be my sinuses are clearing?  Geez up one day down the next. Some tightness in the chest but thinking it is still anxiety. Drinking water and juice. Ate a little something which seems to help. Almost to the point of having a good cry. Keep reminding myself that this is part of healing and that in order to come out the other side I must deal with these things and keep fighting.     This is not an sos but just a rant to keep me motivated. It helps to write it all down.     A friend gave me some of those marshmallow peeps and I think I am gonna go and bite their heads off and then take a nap.    Refuse to smoke but withdrawal sucks. There now I feel better already. 
That's the way to do it desperate1, vent all you need and get it out! The chest tightness is normal, your lungs are already trying to start clear that gunk out. The tiredness too is normal. Sweets help a lot with keeping blood sugar up so indulge yourself. It's very important to listen to your body during these first few weeks. If it's hungry, eat. Tired, sleep. It's working hard on trying to  repair all the damage done by our years of smoking. You're doing great!
It can suck the first few days and is a struggle but it can be done and you are showing that it can be done.  Keep up with the advice that you have been given and are following -- it will help.  It will get better (slowly), once you get thru the first 72 to 96 hours you get past the physical symptoms.  From what you say about how you feel seems pretty typical from withdrawing from smoking.  You are strong and can do this.  Great on posting and post as much as you want -- it can really help!!!!
    Hey D! Unfortunately, it's all part of the early days. Do what ever you have to NOT TO SMOKE. That's really critical at this point. Cry your eyes out or come here and rant & rave. We don't mind and it'll be good for you.        If you end up waking at crazy hours of the night with nothing to occupy your mind, come here and go to the games page. You can get lost there for hours playing whatever games strike your fancy. I spent hours there in my early days. You are going cold turkey I believe. I did as well. Those first days were challenging for sure but, you CAN do it. 
    Good for you having a rant on here.         It's horrible how our emotions are all over the place when we quit smoking. I enjoy having a nice bath with a few candles - it's good for the soul.         I have recently discovered podcasts. I downloaded an app called castbox so I pop on my headphones and just listen for hours. There's so much choice and so many subjects to choose from. You said on your profile you liked true stories and there's loads of those.        You're doing great 
It gets better desperate1, lilly gave you an idea. Serial is a podcast if you like true crime.. Take a nice long walk or workout, keep yourself/mind busy on other things
    Shut up whiner.....just messing.    you will live and it will suck at first say NOPE a million times, it helps  time will drive you crazy, you will have more on your hands and grow bored, so move around. Walk or just do laundry.  Keep busy.    sleep will come and go  chin up Keep Marching
    Lol bacon. I was like what. Thanks for the laugh...needed that 
    Change your name now. Everyone getting to know someone called desperate. Your no longer that.  Don’t use cat in the name either. Cat lady. Cat lover. All bad       Bubbles.  That’s one never used     Dolly was used once...maybe.  Think it might have been Daisy.       Either way pick a name name you like so we get to know YOu.  Not desperate 
    Maybe you shouldn't talk about biting off the heads of bunnies - Jillar might get nervous!      Take it one day at a time, one hour at a time, one moment at a time - you can do this.      My go-to time kill was forum games - find what works for you.       You don't sound desperate at all, you sound committed, keep that positive mindset!      Glad to hear you have been reading, educating yourself about this addiction will bring you the strength needed to separate the truths from the lies.        You are doing great!  KTQ
    Sounds familiar.  Yuck.  Make it a memory by not smoking. Smoke & the vicious cycle continues.   Peeps over poison sounds like a good plan! beazel is right- the games are a great distraction.         Keep up the good work! 
    You are doing great work, D !   Keep your focus.    You quit smoking.   Reward yourself.        You will find that certain craves actually have nothing to do with smoking, they are signals from your body that you are  Hungry,  Angry (emotional),  Lonesome (bored), or  Tired. H.A.L.T.    These bodily needs were gangstered by nicotine and we often just lit up instead of acknowledging  them. Here are two threads that address this.Riffing on H.A.L.T   andHALT      
I walked, went to the sos board, learned how to make hummus to dip stupid vegetables in when eating something was all that was left, outside causing harm to others. Lol. Then I walked some more. And some more. I would suddenly leap up at work and go walk around some buildings. It helped to know that most craves last around 3 minutes, though they seem to last 3 hours. I just had to beat basically a soft boiled egg.       There are are so many jokes I could end with here...
Thanks Aine for the advise. Love hummus by the way. Jokes are always helpful. Keep me upbeat.   Bacon maybe Dolly Bubbles or Daisy Duke I'll stay away from bunnies for sure beazel.    Ty lust4life and Sazerac. Every suggestion helps.
    Hi Redemption and thanks for the tip. Some of those jump out of your skin feelings are brutal. So far I have gotten up and paced and deep breathing exercises have helped. Coughing has started today. I notice that when I suck on a peppermint candy and do the breathing exercise it seems to mimic smoking somehow. Works for now. Just a soothing feeling. But know I will have to stop that. Don't want to keep thinking of smoking. This too shall pass. Hanging in there
    I used ordinary regular gum D....it kept my mind and my mouth busy ...you have no nicotine in your body now ....    No reason to put it back .....your clean ....it's just you and your mind now ...your stronger than any crave ...outsmart it ....keep busy.  Nope !!!!!
Congratulations !   You already have most of the nicotine out of your body  and will find the power to crush your craves and triggers !     Expect some discomfort and learn new skills to handle them.     Be kind to yourself.    Reward yourself with every crave you beat.  Drink water.    Use Jillars Air Cigarette or a stick of cinnamon.   Drink juice, keep your blood sugar up.      Do anything but bring nicotine back into your life. You are winning and we are all so proud of you. S            Edited March 18 by Sazerac
    No I have no intention of putting nicotine in me again. Am drinking tons of water and using the peppermint candy. Also have some regular gum. Chomping away on it. Also eating those marshmallow peeps and doing jillars air cigarette...it helps. Just the peeps jillar...no bunnies. Going to watch videos. 

            The enemy is our addiction to nicotine.  
    Quote taken from The Harmful Effects of Nicotine        "Nicotine poses several health hazards. There is an increased risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal disorders.  There is decreased immune response and it also poses ill impacts on the reproductive health.    It affects the cell proliferation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, DNA mutation by various mechanisms which leads to cancer.   It also affects the tumor proliferation and metastasis and causes resistance to chemo and radio therapeutic agents."
    Quote taken from The Oral Cancer Foundation's article,   Cancer Risk of Nicotine Gum and Lozenges   "Scientists have discovered a link between mouth cancer and exposure to nicotine,   which may indicate that using oral nicotine replacement therapies for long periods could contribute to a raised risk of the disease.    A study funded by the Medical Research Council, led by Muy-Teck Teh, of Queen Mary, University of London,   has found that the effects of a genetic mutation that is common in mouth cancer can be worsened by nicotine in the levels that are typically found in smoking cessation products"
I think sometimes telling ourselves and others why we quit to begin with can help hold us accountable.  I quit for a lot of reasons,  being diagnosed with COPD, Not wanting my son to pick up the habit, and the fact that I was just tired of it top the list.
My simplest answer is that I truly hated smoking.  Everything about it sucked and I couldn't see anything positive to doing it.  For a long time all I could think about is how much I hated smoking but I kept doing it.  Eventually I got sick with a respiratory thing and that sealed the deal.  I woke up one morning 4.5 months ago and just didn't smoke. The rest is history.
I quit smoking so it didn`t rob me of my mobility or increase my chances of diseases and ill health for later in my  life.
Hmmm - Clearly need to work on my tech skills One word. FREEDOM!
This is what I meant - I hope....  
Mine was being a slave to checking my purse each day, for the money needed to fund it.
I was at risk of having my feet amputated......can you imagine that.....I like them just where they are....on the end of my legs......not in the dust bin.....Also my hubby on oxygen......What a right pair we would have looked like.....At least I can still do the shuffle.....Well sort of
I was tired of something so stupid controlling me.  I was smarter than that addiction but I was a prisoner.  I wanted freedom I knew that some day I would quit.  Whether it was forced upon me or by choice.  I preferred the latter.  It was a great choice!  FREEDOM ROCKS!
To increase the chance of getting pregnant.  But I know that it is so much more than that now!!
I quit smoking for the same reason I started smoking. It was a choice. I chose to smoke. And 35 years later I chose to quit. I hold myself accountable for all of my choices, good or bad.
 I had a multitude of reasons that began piling up......outweighing the dysfunctional voice of addiction.......but this, this little man was the icing on the cake. He was what gave me the final push I needed.

I really admire your courage and good humour!
I was constantly having to clear my throat.  It drove me crazy.  It was gross and embarrassing.  I could barely get a sentence out. 
I don't like doctors.

To fix a problem.  I knew I would one morning when I was coughing so hard that I couldn't smoke my first cigarette.  I would take half a puff then start a coughing fit again.  I was getting really pissed that I couldn't smoke my cigarette in peace because of the constant smokers' hack.  Smoking a cigarette was battled to a standstill by cigarette smoking's effects and my poor body was the battleground.  At that moment I thought of way to solve this problem!  ( If you are not a nicotine addict the problem seems pretty easy to fix. )
There are really lots of reasons to quit! 1. Health2. Money3. Family4. Smell5. Freedom
So many reasons! I think I originally decided to quit because I was sick. I was also sick of making myself sick from smoking. At the time of my quit, I had been sick for about a week with a terrible throat thing that just did not want to go away. I was still smoking, even while sick. I got to the point where I asked myself WHY. Why was I making my situation worse? I'd smoke and cough... and cough... and cough some more! It was terrible.  I was lucky to have amazing support from my never-smoker boyfriend. He was great. I don't think I would have been successful without him to be honest. My entire family smokes and it would have been very difficult for me to do so being around them.  There are many reasons I quit. Health was a big one, followed by watching some of my loved ones suffer with illnesses. Money was a big factor too. My addiction was so bad, I replaced food with smoking sometimes. Talk about mental!
I didn't like the smell of burning cigarettes.
i didnt want to die at 56 like my dad did and didnt want to be on a mechine to breathdidnt like the morning coughingdidnt enjoy smoking anymore
High blood pressure, high cholesterol, impending diabetes, and imminent heart attack . Doctors Orders: Sarge Must Not Smoke! And so he quit.    Easy Peasy
I wanted to make 50 and beyond smoke free.
What a great thread to re-read :) 
I quit because....I wanted too.I stayed quit because of some of members here helping, and someone in real world said "You'll start again." Proved them wrong.....asshole.
I was starting to suffer shortness of breath, my teeth were in a bad way, my oldest kept begging me to quit and I was really ashamed to be a smoker, hated stinking soo much.Vanity aswell, noticed I started getting a few wrinkles, yellow teeth, hair wasn't in great condition, yellow fingers, coughing.
I quitted  because I was at risk oh having both my feet amputated......due to no circulation....This freaked me out....I finally realised having two feet were better that 20 cigs a day....Plus hubby on a oxygen machine most of the day.....One could say..I woke up and smelt the coffee....
I stay quit for my above reasons 
I quit on my 39th Birthday so I'd be a year long non smoker by 40. Still not smoking over a year later.
I quit cause I love my kids and I want to be with them as long as possible.  I also did not want them the see me die a horrible death. keepin on
Newbies..and not so newbies..add your reason..its good to look back on ....
Not sure why i quit, but i somehow managed it, so now i have a crap ton of reasons to not go back. And i wont. Seriously, who wants to go back to smoking??
I finally got fed up with smoking.  Planning my every waking hour around smokebreaks was a pain in the ass.  It felt like the Marlboro Man had taken the helm and I was just along for the ride.
I think part of the reason was also that I wanted to see if I could actually do it because I knew it would be really tough. Sounds weird but I like to challenge myself from time to time and that has ended me up in hospital twice in my lifetime with serious injuries so I figured that this challenge would either have no effect on my life if I failed or, it would benefit me if I was successful. I know that's strange but as long as it works out; it's all good :)
I quit because....I wanted too.I stayed quit because of some of members here helping, and someone in real world said "You'll start again." Proved them wrong.....asshole. Hmmm... If he helped you to stay off the smokes then are you entirely certain that he deserves that honorific?

I was thinking about asking this question today,    Why Did You Quit Smoking ?      Glad I found this thread.   Good to read all the anecdotal evidence and see the nascence of many successful quits.      I quit smoking on a whim and as a challenge to myself.  I considered myself a strong/powerful woman but, it was slowly dawning on me that I was just a slave to nicotine.       I was curious to see if I had the muster to quit.   I did.  You do too !            Why did y'all quit smoking ?         Edited March 16 by Sazerac

I was one of those dummies who smoked in my house. Now with all this anxiety I am feeling I decided to get up tomorrow and start scrubbing some walls to keep me busy. Can anyone tell me how to get nicotine off walls and what to use to get some of the smell out of my house?  At almost 16 hours in am really anxious but hanging in there. Drinking lots of water and by going through posts and watching videos at why quit has helped immensely. So glad I found this train. Just having so much of this antsy feeling. As if I need to get up and move. Sorry if I seem to be rambling on. Just need to keep busy.
    When I became I homeowner I quit smoking in my house but in the rental houses before that I used TSP to scrub the walls. It's a powder that you mix with water and it did a good job at getting rid of the nicotine. You could probably even use Simple Green mixed with water and it's got a nice smell too  The antsy feeling is totally normal. I wish I had of got that instead of the tired feeling. I was too exhausted to even think about doing anything. So when you're done doing your stuff and are feeling antsy still, come on over and clean my house 
    No need to say sorry, good for you  to reach out.       Its been a long time since i smoked in the house, but I remember I put cups of water with vinegar in the house, vinegar attracts odours (and flies!). I even sprayed it on the couch. The smell of the vinegar itself diasappears after a while.        Windows open, curtains in the washing machine... enjoy!
    Ty Jillar. Will look into getting some. I know that my attempted quits(lasting not even a day) I would be extra tired. Now this one is different. I think its way too much coffee. So cut that out for today. Will gladly do yours next if it helps keep the quit.  Thanks MLMR vinegar it is. 
Be careful with coffee.         "Anyone who feels jittery after a few days of quitting should examine his or her caffeine consumption levels. Many find that they cannot tolerate caffeine consumption at prequit levels," says Spitzer. "If you are experiencing a jittery feeling you may want to experiment with reducing quantity or strength of caffeinated drinks or products."    https://whyquit.com/pr/041407.html
It gets all over everything, i just re painted the walls.           The White Vinegar Solution  More than one method removes tar and nicotine cigarette stains from walls. Start by adding warmed vinegar to a spray bottle for tough stains. Dilute using a one-to-one ratio with warm water for less noticeable stains. Apply the warmed vinegar or mixture directly to the walls. Because tar and nicotine develop a sticky and hardened surface, the warmth of the vinegar helps to soften these substances. Vinegar removes both smells and stains.    The Ammonia Method  Ammonia can also remove cigarette tar and nicotine from walls when mixed with water. Combine a tablespoon of ammonia for every cup of water, or roughly 1/2 cup of ammonia to a gallon of warm water. For painted walls, reduce the mixture to 1/4 cup to a gallon of water. For a stronger solution, increase the ammonia to a full cup. Apply the cleaning agent directly to the wall and let it sit for about five minutes before wiping it off. Follow with a clean rinse of warm water.    For Tough Cigarette Stains  Trisodium phosphate works best to get rid of tough stains because it also degreases the tars from cigarette smoke. You can find trisodium phosphate where you normally purchase household cleaning agents or at your local home improvement or hardware store. Wear gloves when you apply it to the walls after mixing 1 tablespoon in a gallon of warm water. To avoid streaks, start at the bottom of the wall and work your way up. Let the mixture sit on the walls before wiping it off. Rinse with a sponge dipped in clean water, changing the rinse water often as you work. Once walls are clean, they might require a primer and paint coat to freshen them up. Choose a primer product that can cover tough stains.  The Smoky Smell All of these solutions can remove the cigarette stink from the walls, but the smell may linger inside the home and recontaminate the walls if you forget to clean the filters for the home's HVAC system. As you clean the walls, ventilate the house thoroughly. If the house has a whole house fan, turn it on or temporarily set a large reversible square fan inside a window to vent the household air outside. Remove and clean washable cold-air return filters or replace them completely. Clean the grates around the cold-air return to remove tar and nicotine stains. Clean the carpet and drapes thoroughly to get all the offensive odors out of the home.
    Thank you Whispers. Awesome and thorough reply. Very helpful. Yes I have called it a day on the coffee. Hope I can get some sleep tonight!!!
    I smoked in my house too. The smell goes away.  I laundered everything I could with a big spash of white vinegar or baking soda and would have a spray bottle handy.    Once things were pretty clean, I soaked small strips of cloth in peppermint or lemon grass oil or orange oil or what ever you like....lavender ?    and tied them to the front of a few house fans.     If you want fresh paint to stick you should wash with Trisodium phosphat﻿e (TSP) anyway.   Wear gloves. I scoured my house top to bottom during those first weeks/months.   Sure wish that chick would show up once in a while now !        Make sure you look at the link from @MLMR   which addresses the changes in caffeine tolerance when you quit smoking.     
    I’ve never smoked in my own residence (except my parents).  I remember as a pre-smoking teen helping dad clean the kitchen to prepare for painting.  We used a common household cleaner called Spic-N-Span which worked great on the walls and cabinets.   Had to change the water constantly as it would be black with a dozen rinses of the sponge.   Use a nice big sponge when cleaning and then throw the spong away when your done        Dad was under no illusion of what caused the yellowed walls but Mom kept trying to say it was the furnace that caused it, like we were burning coal or something.                
    Lol Wayne. I sure remember spic and span. Thanks for your input. Will try all the above. 
100% smoked in my house...vinegar in a bowl extracted the smell. Scrubbing all the shiz in my house gave me a new lease of life. Both
    Marti I will put out a bowl tonight.  
    I dunno how it worked? Tres odd! But was ever so greatful! The car however needed selling so there's that lol. 
    Industrial grade de-greasers cut the yellow/brown tar stains on everything.     EZPZ
    Thanks sgt.  Will keep that in mind. 
Wow! Lots of input here on this one      Here's my 2 cents worth:   Freshening the smell - get fabric items in your home cleaned - carpets, drapes fabric covered furniture. That's what holds the smokey smell the most.       If your walls are stained, by all means wash them down with whatever you like but understand that you may have to repaint depending on the paint finish on the walls you're washing. Do a small test spot first and let it dry completely to see if the paint color changes. Flat or eggshell finish (most often used in living areas/bedrooms/closets) do not wash well. They may end up streaky and faded after washing. Gloss or semi - gloss finish (most often used in kitchens & bathrooms) withstands washing pretty well.       Keep yourself occupied and stay focused on your quit. That's job 1 for now      .
    I would just slap a coat of paint on in every room. It will keep you busy and the house will smell divine.      Buy one of those small steamers and run it over the carpets and then just wash everything before you put it back in the room.                    
    Recip thanks for your input. Figured anything to keep busy will help. Plus doing something helps curb pent up anxiety.  Lilly you must have read my mind. Decided to start painting at least some of house. I can afford some paint now with extra money I have now
    There you go. Fresh coat of paint as a reward for quitting. Love it!
Last night I got my ECG results in an email: abnormal ECG. Evidence of possible myocardial infarction (heart attack), age unknown. I can only take comfort in the fact that it must have been very minor if it indeed occurred. I'm scared out of my wits waiting for the cardiologist to call and explain further. I hope she doesn't keep me waiting too long. There is an extensive history of heart disease in my family. One thing is certain:     I WILL NEVER SMOKE AGAIN. EVER.     In other news, today is my birthday.  The big 42! (Nerds across the galaxy will understand the significance of that number.) I'm happy to be celebrating it smoke free!Edited March 13 by abbynormal
    Hi      I hope its good news .      Whichever way at least you are determined not to smoke again.       PS I loved Douglas Adams (Sad I know)
    Oh Abby that is not the present you had hoped for today.        You really have done the best thing you could have done for your health by quitting smoking.        I'm praying that the Cardiologist gives you some good news.         Please let us know what they say xx
    Hey, Abby.  Sorry you are on tenterhooks waiting for the Doctor, stressful Birthday !   Keep calling her back and often !  so, you don't get lost between the cracks.       Remember to Breathe and do something to reward yourself today.  Make it something extra soothing.   Maybe an hours long bath with a martini in hand or, cocoa ?
    Hoping for the best result for you Abby.......  Pamper yourself ...it's your Birthday ...   Good to hear  you will never smoke again ..x
    We can't change decisions we made in the past. All we can do is make better decisions today and .... you have done that by committing to a smoke free future  
    Sorry for the bum news Abby, thank goodness it was  minor! And thank goodness you quit smoking!! I hope your birthday gets better...……..
    Sorry to hear this, Abby.  I hope you get good news from the doctor.        And yes, this is a huge reason to stay smoke free. 
    I agree it must have been minor- or they would’ve seen you in person to discuss the results or send you for further testing STAT.  Nonetheless, super scary to read that news.  How great is it that you are already a non-smoker?? One less thing to worry over or change. You can focus on other things.      Your recommitment to stay smoke free is the best present (especially birthday) you could give yourself! Great job!      Happy Birthday and cheers to many more! 
    Happy Birthday to you Abby and a good one to be smoke free.  Sorry about the news but one of the best things that you can do for this is to quit smoking and that you have done, will help your heart greatly (know from experience and I am kind of going thru the same thing now).  As said above could be minor or they would have had the discussion face to face. I am sure your cardiologist will have more to say to help you along.
    Happy Birthday Abby and my best wishes and prayers for good news for you.
    Abby Normal!  Happy birthday, and remember you are still very young!  I'll be thinking happy, positive thoughts about your heart.  Thank God you quit smoking already, you've done a great thing for your health.  I hope you do something fun for your birthday, you are in my thoughts!
Scary news, Abby!  Hope you will know more soon. Take care while waiting for news.      Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy!! Long time favorite!       "Space is big.

How Addiction Hijacks Your Brain    By The Fix staff 03/06/19 Sponsored What we know, and what is still a mystery.  It’s impossible to talk about addiction and recovery without considering the effect that substance abuse has on the brain, and how brain changes wrought by addiction can affect a person’s ability to get and stay sober.  “The brain is the main player in addiction, and countless areas of the brain are affected. Addiction is a disease of the brain,” said Beth Wright, a therapist intern at MFI Recovery Center, which provides affordable rehab for people with substance use disorder in California. “When we are using substances we are tampering with our brains and all the amazing natural chemicals in it.”    Understanding how addiction affects our brains and the chemical communications that take place within them can help people understand the process of addiction and recovery.    How Does the Brain Become Addicted? Although there is still an idea that substance use is a choice, science is making it clear that addictive substances change the make-up of our brains, making it more likely that people will continue to use substances even if it does them harm. “While addiction professionals and addicts understand that addiction is a chronic disease, often an individual who has never struggled with addiction will frustratingly argue that addiction is a matter of willpower,” Wright said. “Addiction occurs in incredibly intelligent, high-functioning individuals and does not discriminate. It is not a matter of sheer willpower.”  This is because addiction affects two important systems in the brain: the amygdala, which controls conditioned learning and affects our feeling or rewards, and the frontal cortex, which affects decision making, judgement and much more. “Brain structure and function are both altered by addiction. An addict becomes trapped in the endless cycle of craving, intoxication, and withdrawal, which leads to cravings, intoxication and withdrawal – the endless cycle,” Wright said. This becomes worse over time. “The more the individual uses a substance, the greater the damage done to the brain,” Wright said. Rather than thinking rationally, a person’s decision making becomes dominated by their need to get the next dose of their drug of choice.    “The individual in the simplest terms becomes motivated by the reward system, and all rational thinking becomes secondary,” Wright said. “Motivation for all behavior begins coming from the addict believing the drug is needed to survive, which is the mid-brain running the show and overriding any rational thinking our frontal cortex would normally suggest, such as not selling all of our family’s jewelry for meth, or spending our last dime on a gram of heroin when we are late on our rent.” In addition, facing life without the drug becomes unbearable. The person who is addicted believes that they need their drug of choice to survive, and that becomes the primary driving force in their day to day lives. “The desire for the drug will override the need for food, shelter, sex, our basic human needs,” Wright said.    Repairing the Dopamine System   Dopamine is a brain chemical that is naturally released when we experience pleasure. However, drugs flood the dopamine system. To attempt to regulate this, the brains of people using drugs will stop producing dopamine and eliminate dopamine receptors, Wright said.    This can make it tough when people with substance use disorder enter a drug treatment program and get sober, since they don’t feel the same dopamine hit from regular activities like music or physical touch.  “If and when an addict decides to enter recovery and stop substance use, the brain needs time to begin producing its own natural dopamine and begin repairing receptors. We have to patiently wait as our brain heals itself and we have usually by this point depleted our natural ‘feel good’ chemicals in our brains,” Wright said. “This takes time, where with addiction, the dopamine surge is immediate. Instant gratification is what every addict becomes accustomed to, hence the horrible relapse statistics.”   People in recovery also need to retrain their brains to remember not just the euphoric high of their drug of choice, but also the real negative consequences.   “Recovery will involve uncovering and challenging the addict to face memories or ‘triggers’ such as seeing a needle or a bottle of alcohol, and with time the implementing of new behaviors and creating coping skills in order to rewire the brain,” Wright said.  The Unknowns About Addiction and the Brain  How exactly drugs affect the brain depends on many factors, including what type of drug a person uses.  “This is the absolute simplest way of describing the brain. So many fascinating and terrifying changes can occur in the brain during substance abuse depending on numerous factors – age of onset, mental health disorders, substance being abused, etc.,” Wright said. Methamphetamine use can cause psychosis in an individual who previously has not had mental health issues. Alcoholics can drink themselves to the point of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which causes dementia-like symptoms. Memory loss can be permanent, and psychosis may occur for several days or several months.   Although the specifics may vary, it is clear that drugs can have lasting and dangerous effects on brain health.          https://www.thefix.com/how-addiction-hijacks-your-brain
Wrenching my brain back from addiction was my biggest challenge.I know I am not alone in this.When I started to purposefully replace smokey thoughts with thoughts of beauty, my healing accelerated.    I would physically look, listen, touch or taste something of beauty to give my brain an alternative that also provided endorphins and triggered my reward response.     I still use this technique if troubled in any way and it helps me stop the tape loop in my head.    
    Very informative post. Very good advice too Sazerac
Hi all!! Just popping in real quick to say Hi!!! and let you all know I'm still chugging along. Haven't had a smoke in 5 months!!!

But I got this.

Quitting Smoking: Closer with Every Attempt Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States, accounting for 480,000 premature deaths per year.1 The havoc cigarettes wreak on the body has been widely known for many years now among health professionals and the public, yet according to the latest data from the National Health Information Survey, 34.3 million U.S. adults still smoked cigarettes in 2017.2   What keeps people smoking even when they know cigarettes are harmful to their health? Nicotine. Nicotine, the highly addictive drug present in tobacco products, is the main reason that people continue to use tobacco even when they want to quit.3 According to a 2015 survey, about 70 percent of current adult smokers in the United States wanted to quit, and although about 55 percent had attempted to do so in the past year, only 7 percent were successful in quitting for 6-12 months.4    If you are in the majority of adult smokers who have made an unsuccessful quit attempt in the last year, do not give up. Try again. Cigarettes are designed to deliver nicotine quickly to the brain, and because your brain is addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes, they are difficult to quit, both physically and mentally. Although addiction makes quitting especially hard, remember it can be done.   Quitting Smoking: Closer with Each Attempt  When you first quit smoking, your body goes through withdrawal, or the physical manifestation of nicotine leaving your system.  Withdrawal symptoms may include: temporary depression; disrupted sleep patterns; irritability; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; increased appetite.5 The first few days are the most uncomfortable, and physical symptoms of withdrawal should only last about three weeks. However, many smokers find that certain places, occasions, and behaviors—such as drinking coffee going out with friends, or particularly stressful events—can bring up an urge to smoke even after withdrawal symptoms have ended.6 While it may take longer to break these patterns, it is possible to live a completely smoke-free life.    Cigarettes’ addictive nature, the discomfort of withdrawal, and environmental factors associated with the act of smoking all play a role in making quitting a difficult and daunting task.  But quitting is possible.  It takes many smokers multiple tries to permanently quit smoking, but each quit attempt is not in vain, but rather, can be thought of as practice for quitting for good.  With every attempt, you learn more about yourself and your addiction,7 including what techniques work for you to help you stave off cravings.  Each of these practice tries gets you that much closer to quitting cigarettes forever.  Nicotine Replacement Therapy    If you have struggled with quitting in the past and are ready to try again, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) may help. NRT can help get addicted smokers through the toughest part of quitting, by relieving cravings, lessening withdrawal symptoms, and helping to reduce stress. When you use FDA-approved NRTs, you gradually withdraw from smoking by receiving measured amounts of nicotine without the toxic chemicals from cigarette smoke. When used properly, NRTs are safe and effective cessation methods and can double a smoker’s chances of quitting cigarettes successfully.8 NRTs are available both by prescription and over-the-counter for adults age 18 and over, and include:   Skin patches that deliver nicotine through the skin.    Nicotine gum that releases nicotine as you chew it. Nicotine lozenges that dissolve in your mouth.  Although NRTs are intended to be used temporarily with the nicotine amounts decreased over time, and eventually removed completely, FDA and doctors recognize that some addicted smokers may need NRTs for longer lengths of time to avoid smoking. If you have unsuccessfully attempted to quit smoking with NRTs, you may want to revisit this option. Many smokers need to experiment with different NRT options before finding one that works for their individual needs. NRTs are considered safe enough that multiple methods9—for instance the patch and the gum—can be used at the same time, and you may start using NRT prior to quitting cigarettes.10  This tactic may alleviate some withdrawal symptoms, as your brain will still receive nicotine during your transition from cigarettes to NRTs. Telephone quit line counseling (PDF) is another effective strategy, and combining counseling with NRTs can be more successful for quitting smoking than nicotine replacement therapy alone.11  How Tobacco Regulation Plays a Role in Helping You Quit FDA understands that quitting is a difficult process, and that NRTs may not work for everyone. The agency’s Nicotine Steering Committee is tasked with researching potential new harm reduction and cessation methods for addicted smokers.  Additionally, in July 2017, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., announced the agency’s intention to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to minimally addictive or nonaddictive levels. While this action would not remove cigarettes from the market, taking the addictive property out of cigarettes would provide addicted adult smokers with a chance to attempt to quit with the help of NRTs, or to switch to other potentially less harmful tobacco products, like e-cigarettes. While more research is needed to understand the potential health risks and benefits of e-cigarettes at both the individual and population level, a 2018 report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine found that completely switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes may offer addicted adult smokers a significant harm-reduction opportunity.    Each Quit Attempt is a Step Forward As 2019 approaches, if you are among the 34 million U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes in this country,12 and your New Year’s Resolution is to quit smoking, either for the first time or to make another attempt, do not give up, and know that you are not alone. Many smokers do not quit on their first attempt and need several tries before they succeed.. Even small successes are wins.  For instance, you may find that the next time you try to quit, you are able to go longer without a cigarette than the last time; or you might discover exercise helps to stave off your cravings. Each time you make a quit attempt, you learn new techniques to implement and move one step closer to being able to call yourself a “former smoker.”         https://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/PublicHealthEducation/HealthInformation/ucm628369.htm?utm_source=CTPTwitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ctp-healthobservance
    This post is great Whispers x
This is a post that Joel used to use quite often at the Freedom From Nicotine Message Board before they implemented their no relapse policy.  While it's no longer used at Freedom, it's a very insightful and an excellent message for all of us, especially those who have relapsed and most importantly, mirrors our ideology concerning relapse.  A special thanks to Joel for allowing us to use this. I tried freedom once, why bother trying again? Some past participants have shown a certain reluctance to return to Freedom after relapsing back to smoking.  Many are embarrassed to come back admitting failure.  Others feel they tried Freedom once, and, since they went back to smoking, its techniques must not have worked for them, so why bother trying the same approach again?  Still others feel it is an inconvenience and an unnecessary commitment of time and effort considering they "heard it all before." The concept of returning after a relapse may seem embarrassing at first, but, the ex-smoker will probably see quickly he is not alone.  Many people have had past quits prior to joining Freedom and understand the fragility of a quit. They will generally understand and accept the presence of repeaters enthusiastically.  Relapsers offer a strong confirmation of the concept of addiction to our old members and to all new participants.  They often openly share their past experience of how, after initially quitting, they came to a point of complacency which allowed the relapse to occur.  They generally reflect back at their non-smoking period as a time where they felt emotionally and physically better, and then openly express the disgust and misery that the relapse brought on.  Not only did it cause embarrassment, physical discomfort, and maybe even serious health complications, but also, it was putting them through quitting all over again.  Their insights offer a valuable lesson to first time participants not to make the one tragic mistake that could lead them back to smoking and the need for quitting over again--taking a puff on a cigarette. As far as it being an inconvenience, while reading and posting may take a chunk of time out of a smokers life the first few days, in all probability, there is nothing a smoker has to do the week that he or she is stopping that is as important as quitting smoking.  Failure to touch base daily with us because of conflicts of time with social or even professional commitments makes about as much sense as a cancer patient skipping life saving chemotherapy treatments for the same events.  Missing an entire day because of prior time commitments may jeopardize the quitting process or the long-term maintenance of smoking cessation.  This may cost the person his or her life.  In the long run, it will probably be viewed as an error in judgment by the patient as well as any significant others who recognize what was put at risk and what was lost in the process. For those who feel that Freedom didn't work, the fact is that the techniques taught here didn't fail, the smoker's implementation did.  Only one recurrent theme runs through Freedom: if you don't wish to go back to smoking--NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!  No one ever went back to smoking without disregarding that rule.  Relapsing is an automatic admission that the smoker disregarded the basic principal taught at Freedom. As far as feeling that "I've heard it all before," being a relapser is evidence enough that the smoker did not hear it or comprehend it all before, or is the type of person who needs to hear it over and over again in order to keep believing it.  Repeaters are people who have trouble initially accepting or keeping the concept of addiction alive.  This trait is in all probability the reason why the ex-smoker originally relapsed, or maybe didn't stop at all the first time.  He or she reached a point of complacency where it was believed that smoking could be controlled at an acceptable level.  Smoking is an all or nothing proposition.  The repeater must recognize the reason for the past failure and learn from the experience.  Otherwise, he or she will be doomed to repeat it over and over again. If you have gone back to smoking, come in and try again.  Once you quit smoking, do everything in your power to stay off.  Come in for continued reinforcement and witness the mistakes of other past participants who got complacent.  As far as addiction goes, it is much better to learn from others' mistakes than having to attend later due to your own.  You just don't know whether you will ever have the strength, desire, or opportunity to quit the next time.  In today's society, failing to stay off smoking carries long-term risks which include loss of social status, and respect of others; financial implications which range from supporting an addiction costing hundreds to thousands of dollars per year as well as possibly costing your job and career; and, most significantly, eventual loss of health, and possibly loss of life.  Considering all of this, the choice to quit smoking and to stay off is an important one.  To keep the ability to stay off smoking you need to always remember to NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF! © Joel Spitzer, 2000
    Bump 
    Well, I had a dream that a coworker and I were hanging out in a bar in a casino smoking. I woke up with that familiar guilty feeling only to realize it was a dream and all is well.        It's so strange that -after being quit for over two years and having no desire to smoke- I still have the occasional smoking dream. What a crazy addiction.
    I too have this happen every so often, I feel so guilty when I wake up then come to see it is only a dream -- in a way it seems to strengthen my quit--- as you say "crazy"!!!!!
    Your thread title scared me, Jim, but I knew you weren't going to light back up.        I still have the occasional smoking dream as well..

Jim,    You're click bait headline is misleading and aggravating.   Glad it was just a dream.Edited March 13 by Sazerac
1. Get 20 popsicle sticks   2. Write a reason to quit on each stick 3.Take an empty cigarette pack ~ and fill it with the popsicle sticks.  Every time you feel like lighting up, pull out a reason to quit instead
    LOVE this, great idea whispers 
    That's clever, I love it!
    The day before I quit, I took a bunch of old butts and put them in a clean mayonnaise jar and set it on my desk. Whenever I got a craving, I'd unscrew the lid and take a big whiff.        I only needed to do that a few times.        
    Great idea Whispers!!!
    I love this idea Whispers 
No Smoking Day was first celebrated on Ash Wednesday 1984 in the United Kingdom. Designed as a day to educate and encourage smokers to quit from its humble beginnings it is now celebrated around the world in many countries. Today (yep its already the 13th down under) is about encouraging those who still smoke to break free of the chains of tobacco and nicotine addiction.       Time has shown us just how terrible smoking is. Even if you don't care that your stink, you don't care if your teeth rot or your gums retract, the health dangers can not be denied. The toxins in a cigarette can cause many different forms of cancer from the mouth to the lungs. It can destroy your heart, your lungs, your circulatory system affecting your feet. What is also important to know is that while it may be a personal choice to smoke or not, when one smokes near another person -or even a pet – the second-hand smoke is just as dangerous to them. So, in fact, it really isn’t just a personal decision. The protection of people who do not want to be effected by second-hand smoke has led to new laws in most communities that ban smoking in most public spaces.     But we have all quit you say, how do we celebrate No Smoking Day... its simple, reflect on everything you have gained since you quit. Remember the journey you have taken to get back your freedom. Remember the one or two thing that really helped you keep your quit when you were still doing the hard slog. Remember all these things, reflect on them and then share them.        If you are still a smoker, and lurking out there waiting to jump aboard the QuitTrain make today the day you quit. We know at least one person out there who is quitting today. Contact a quit councilor, look at the options available to aid your quit, not everyone needs them but some of us do. But even if you aren't ready to take the plunge, take the time to do 3 things to move towards your quit, watch a video, read an article, ask a question, learn one new thing. If you have health insurance, see if you plan includes support to quit smoking. Just do something.
    These are what helped me through....     

    I just wrote this on DizzyD's introductory thread   I kept yelling, 'FREE YOUR HEAD!"   I took screaming hot showers.   I drank water.  I ate all the Satsumas in town. Finally, I was able to replace a smokey thought with something of beauty, a sensory delight.    'that light on that leaf' or 'the taste explosion of that Satsuma',  I would listen intently to that piece of music or, luxuriate in that warm embryonic wind...    This technique helped me the most. ﻿
    You can do it ....all you need is the will to win....the determination.... You can rid yourself of this  killer addiction for good....  Quitting with friends is so much more easier and fun too.....trust me !!!.....
Hey, March 13th is also my birthday! I'm honored to share it with No Smoking Day.       I wrote the following on another post last night, but it just about sums up my quit and all that I've learned so far in the process...      I've always been a "stress smoker." Time after time I used stress as an excuse to light up again, even after I had quit for a long time. But what I've finally learned about smoking and it's relationship to stress is this:       Smoking doesn't help. Not even a little bit.        Smoking ADDS to my stress by compounding my current health issues and putting me in danger of new (and worse) ones.     Smoking adds stress by costing me money I don't have, so I can't afford the basic necessities.      Smoking adds stress by making me cough every time I laugh.      Smoking adds stress by putting me into a constant state of nicotine withdrawal.     Smoking adds stress by causing me to have to hide my disgusting habit from others.      Smoking adds stress by forcing me to face my mortality with each and every puff.        You see, I finally figured out that I am more afraid of dying than I am of living.      I just want to live the best life I can, one day at a time. And smoking just doesn't fit into that equation.        Happy smoke-free birthday to me!
    Jo that's a great post. If you are reading and thinking of quitting you will find a ton of support here.        Happy Birthday Abby.  You already gave yourself the best gift by quitting  Hope you have a great day.

I get sad whenever I read about someone that relapses after rocking an awesome quit for weeks or months. I quit smoking 290 days ago and I'm extremely confident I'll never smoke again. Things were a little different on day 142 though. That's the day I almost smoked a cigarette.....      Quote       Day 142.        I have been romanticizing the cigarette for about a week now. I've been daydreaming about the simple joy of holding a cigarette between my fingers, the wonderful tobacco smell of a freshly opened pack, and the feeling of euphoria when taking that first drag. Mmmm....just thinking about it makes my pulse quicken in glorious anticipation.      W. T. F.            This is day 142! I'm "this close" to 5 months.  6 months (HALF A YEAR!) is within spitting distance. How the hell could I let myself get so damn complacent that I'm having thoughts like this? For the most part, my quit has been on auto-pilot for the last couple of months. I stopped actively "quitting" a long time ago. I didn't feel the need, or desire, to spend hours a day reading/posting about nicotine addiction like I did the first several weeks of my quit.         I've lost my motivation and I'm tired of fighting. THAT right there scares the crap out of me. I do NOT want to be a smoker again. I will NOT be a smoker again. I REFUSE to be a smoker again. It is time to fix this thing and get my head back in this quit.         During the early days of a new quit everything is so exciting. You are doing a Good Thing and it's AWESOME! YOU are AWESOME! Loved ones shower you with praise! Strangers on the internet tell you how wonderful you are! You can suddenly smell and taste All The Things! People at work give you high fives and fist bumps! There are parades in your honor! The mayor gives you the key to the city! TMZ hounds you for an interview! Life is FREAKING AMAZING!!!        And then, a few weeks or months later…..things change. Family and friends begin treating you the way they did before you quit. No more high fives. No more fist bumps. No one asks about your quit anymore. Even the paparazzi stop following you around. This “thing” (your quit) isn't fun anymore. Yeah, it’s gotten a lot easier to not smoke but you still sometimes get cravings from hell and you are SO TIRED of fighting. So tired. You feel lonely. You start to hear whispers in your head. It's a voice you thought you silenced a while ago. “Why don’t you just smoke one? It will taste and feel so good. You know you can quit anytime you want.” (My Inner Junkie has a seductive bedroom voice like Barry White and looks like a more sinister version of Wile E. Coyote. Stop judging me!)       Relapse was a very real option for me on day 142 (I'm on day 290 now). I am VERY thankful that I turned things around before it was too late. Some folks don’t. They smoke a cigarette and then a beautiful quit is lost…up in smoke.       I am only posting this to remind everyone, myself included, that we can never let our guards down. I KNOW why I got close to relapse. The reasons are as plain as day to me now:        1.    I stopped educating myself about my addiction.    2.    I greatly decreased the time I spent on this site because I didn't think I needed a support group any longer. 3.    I let a small seed of negative thought (daydreaming of smoking a cigarette) grow until it became a Really Bad Thing.  4.    I fooled myself into thinking I wasn't an addict any more.        What did I do to get my quit back on track?     1.    I re-read all the newbie info here and at whyquit.com 2.    I read Allen Carr’s book. (I read a little bit each day over the course of a couple of months. It was a good daily dose of inspiration.)  3.    I recommitted to spending time on this site reading and helping out where I could.    4.    I admitted to myself that I was always going to be an addict. I can NEVER become complacent again.    5.    I stopped random smoking thoughts IMMEDIATELY whenever I realized what I was thinking about.      Have you come close to relapsing? What did you do to avoid it?      Have you relapsed after a weeks or months long quit? If so, why did it happen and what are you doing now to make sure it doesn't happen again?
    This is a great post from Craig, Jillar.  Thanks for the re-post.   We must never become complacent because addiction doesn't disappear,    it can only be put to sleep and kept asleep. 
    I never get complacent..... Folks have smoked ,when they have a long quit too....we just always be on our guard....

    Jillar, Thanks for posting this.        People start their quit full of enthusiasm, excitement, and/or terror.      As with all things wherein we clock the hours it can become a grind.        .  
I remember having some curiosity about whether I would stay quit.More out of interest, really, rather than any real doubt.   For certain,  I did not relish repeating Hell week.  That will never happen again.  Ever.   I gained confidence at one week, two weeks and a big boost at one month, then two.At Three Months I was fully realizing that I would never smoke again.I might still have some struggles but, the die was cast.     When did you have confidence in your quit ?         Edited September 10, 2018 by Sazerac
Tomorrow
I went back and looked up an old post of mine, I wrote it about three-weeks in.  The realization that the quit was completely in my control finally started to sink in.  There was no need to look around every corner for nicotine monsters and cigarette boogymen.  They don't exist.  You either smoke or you don't.  I also stopped creating hypothetical scenarios and wondering if I could refrain from smoking.  What if this happens...What if that happens?  No external factors have any bearing on whether you smoke or not.  If you are having the best day of your life, a cigarette will not enhance the experience.  If you are having the worst day of your life, a cigarette will not alleviate your problems.  The cigarette offers nothing positive. The day I recognized my addiction as my own creation that has as much or as little power as I give it and stripped the process down to bare essentials, it all started to make sense.  As soon as I stopped complicating quitting, it became simple.
From day one...I knew there was no going back..I started to feel proud of my quit very early on...going from struggling to walk..without pain..To loving the new me..I could walk,dance..cycle..swim etc..pain free..There's nothing like a good amputation scare to make you open your eyes...I have a couple of war wounds left...I think God has left me them to remember .never take another puff..
Took me around five months I think. I never knew from day one, thought I was just going through the motions of pervious attempts. Once I got to five I thought this will be my first Christmas, smoke free, and I knew it was going to be smoke free....and it was.
1 year
 A broad question . Everyone is different . Many factors could apply  . Quitting is not linear . "You are right where you are suppose to be , would have to be my response to others who feel they are not being confident soon enough . I did not make comparisons to others. 
My quit was mixed up in other issues.  I'd guess that I was mostly out of the woods by the 4th month.   The physical craves were intense but passed after a few weeks.  It's the mental habit monster that is so tied up with my behaviors and routines that played merry hell with my resolve. I didn't so much as break the habit as slowly bury it in the casual sediments of passing days, weeks, and months.
When I realise that one, means a pack and that I'm probably ill due smoking and soda. I need to stick with it. NOPE. No matter what.No excuses.
  I didn't so much as break the habit as slowly bury it in the casual sediments of passing days, weeks, and months. this is a beautiful visual, Sirius.
Day two. Day one was The Great Unknown, but from the second day it was in the bag.   Easy Peasy
Today, after a bumpy day yesterday I realized that I don't smoke because its what I want. Freedom from the nic demon and freedom to enjoy my life.
Great thinking D...freedom is a wonderful place to be..a slave no more...x
Today, after a bumpy day yesterday I realized that I don't smoke because its what I want. Freedom from the nic demon and freedom to enjoy my life. And that's how it's done.  Congratulations and enjoy your newfound freedom.

Nice post.      After relapsing after a 1 year quit previously, I know to stay vigilant.        i am confident that if I remember I could ruin my quit at any time with “just one”, I am unlikely to lose my quit.
About a month into the quit I really believed that I could make it this time. I agree with Boo that you have to stop complicating the quit. I was in the hospital for 9 days with pneumonia and told them that I did not want a patch. I had been telling myself for so long that if only I couldn't smoke for a few days I could make it. The hospital time gave me that and now it was put up or shut up time. Once I got home I took the half pack that was opened and 2 full packs and dumped them in a bucket of water and tossed ash trays in the trash. After 3 to 4 weeks I realized it wasn't all that hard. Craves and stressful but not what I had imagined. I do believe that I had complicated the simple act of stop smoking as an excuse to continue to smoke even though it was taking a hard toll on me.
From the very first minute after I flicked that last cigarette in the air into a snow bank in the Urgent Care parking lot (I announced "this is it, this is my last cigarette!!) and  got in co-workers truck to be transported to the hospital (I was having a stroke at the time!) and he was not waiting for an ambulance!!      Once I accepted the fact that I was fighting an addiction (oh, so hard for me to admit this!) and that I was an addict, I was determined not to blow my second chance.....I read everything I could about the nicotine addiction. Joining an online support forum cemented the quit! Also, I told everyone I knew that I had quit....I didn't keep it a secret like I did the first two times I quit. My life was on the line now.......and I am sure that my being quit for 14 months when I was told I now needed CABGx3 surgery (a triple bypass!) helped me survive!        I agree with others above...don't complicate the quit.....just do it....one day at a time....you will not regret it!
There was that nervous initial leap on oct 6th 2017, and honestly after three days i thought, "alright, I can do this". But still nerve racked. When the three week battle never arrived, THAT is when true confidence set in.      But yeah that initial leap, oh yeah, the days or hours building up to it suuuuuuck.
    The minute I put out my last cigarette, I knew I would never smoke again.
Honestly, 8 months in I'm still not confident, but I'm doing it. It is getting easier with the passing of time, so one day soon will be the turning point.
Although I was firm in my commitment to myself never to smoke again right from the first, I think it was about 6 to 7 months in before I really knew I had turned the corner on this addiction and that I had faced pretty much every battle it could through at me. From that point forward I was somehow just more confident that I wouldn't waver in my commitment to quitting.
I don't want to sound cocky but I,too, knew the minute I put out my last cigarette.     Then, again, around the 4 month mark, I told jillar that I'd see her on the lido deck
So I kind of knew the day I played a game on the over there where you had to list famous people and I was stuck in a battle with another newbie (I was about 6 weeks in) using the initials AA... 3 things happened that day, 1. I realised I was about to invent famous people with the intials AA to make sure I won, 2. There was no way I was giving up my quit if the other person didn't give up theirs first the annoying pain in my backside, I mean who did they think they were .... LOL they know who they are and that they went on to become a great friend and not a mortal enemy to be beaten in every game.... so the seeds of a great friendship were sewn and.... 3. I think I can do this became a reality. (although until about the 3.5 month it was still, well shit their still here, can't quit today.... yes I am that mental).  [ No wait, because I know you will read this and I know you will know who you are... if you toss your quit I will probably just go ahead and toss mine too so now you can't toss yours because it's two quits you are responsible for .... joke joyce.... I know I am the only one responsible for my quit and I have my grown up hat on now so don't stress, you are officially off the hook]        Then about 5 months I started to realise I felt completely different about this quit than my big one... every little event that happened the last time I had a substantial quit I looked at it and said, hmmm is that a good reason to have a smoke... and I hadn't done that with this quit, not once, not at all.... I wasn't thinking about smoking all the time... mentally this quit was different....         But just after my 6 month anni when I put in my Lido Deck catering order with Reci it kinda became a done deal... doesn't mean I haven't had bad days, or close calls since because we all know I have... but the reality is I don't see myself ever smoking again and unlike last time I don't want to, I LIKE THE FREEDOM.        I know one puff is it for me... that's all it will take... so NOPE NOPE NOPE... there is still a niggle of self doubt,  but I think that will always be there even in 20 years because I know I do stupid shit, and I know i'm only 1 puff away.... so I need to have that little negative voice of doubt to keep me on the straight and narrow.Edited September 12, 2018 by notsmokinjo
    I can still remember the day I watched the Tobacco War Documentaries....( front page if you havnt watched them )... This changed my whole view of smoking....I knew from then on...I hated the whole scenario.....  No way..was these evil money grabbing ( bleep)....going to get another penny of me...I refused to be another number...   
Id say about 6 months in i was clear...  First 5 months were gangsta. At the 1 year mark i was done.

For myself it was over a year when i got drunk and had no urge to smoke, i was afraid of alcohol that it would trigger me wanting to smoke. I had quit in the past which i had mentioned but i was also avoiding certain triggers. After meeting the triggers head on and flat out saying NO which we do our pledge of NOPE on here i felt confident. To you and sslip, at times even now for myself certain things pop up and I just learned not to reach for them. Thats the difference for me, I'll go for a walk or work out and accepted i had that addict brain and you know what ... Having an addict brain is OK. We're all human and are born to make mistakes..  @Sslip
I just wanted to add something for you peeps who are 7 or 8 months or even a year into your quits. I''m a year and a half in now and I can tell you for sure, I feel A LOT more confident now than I did at even a year so ........ if you are still feeling those small occasional moments of uncertainty, it does still get better as you build even more time into your quit.        I just went through a whole pile of life crap in one month and the stress levels were very high for some time yet not once did the thought of having a smoke enter my mind in terms of making things better - not once!! I can't say the same would have been true at even 1 year quit so ........ it does still keep getting better and better the longer you just say NOPE  Edited September 12, 2018 by reciprocity

Some really great responses here.  In my own case, it was probably 11 months or so that I was really convinced that I was non/ex-smoker (as opposed to convincing myself that I was a non/ex-smoker).  That said, while I haven't had a single craving for or even a passing thought of smoking a cigarette for well over fifteen years, I remain (quietly and gently) vigilant.  The addiction scares me and always will.          Christian99 17+ Years QuitEdited March 8 by Christian99
I have good confidence that I will reach the one year mark. Its the straightforward confidence of NOPE.     But. That doesnt mean I am free of the thoughts, the many addict voices, the rotten days, the 'will this ever end-s'. Still there, though not at all what it was.       I am sure that maintaining my quit through some dramatic life events like the death of a loved one and breakup doubled confidence.      I long for happier days and I know that by the time they arive, the excess of addiction has made room for a more grounded me.       Yes, I am confident about quitting and it means the world to me to be able to say that!Edited March 8 by MLMR
Hi everyone,    I was thinking about what I did before I started smoking cigarettes.  I basically know what I did;  I was an average kid who climbed trees, went to school, etc...   But I was trying to remember what I loved, what made me happy before smoking.  I started smoking when I was 11, so I'm having to think pretty far back in the past.   Do you have memories of your life prior to smoking?
I started smoking my freshman year in college at age 18.  I smoked one memorable (and disgusting) cigarette before then.        I ran cross-country in high school and was an avid runner, mediocre but enthusiastic basketball player, and overall fairly physically fit prior to becoming a smoker.       As I started to smoke in college , I found it gradually harder to run for endurance, stay physically active, etc. and I became a lot less athletic as staying physically fit slowly became less of a priority.      Smoking robs people of their quality of life in so many different ways.Edited March 4 by johnny5
I had three brothers to keep up with.  We climbed trees, caught poly wogs in the creek near our home and made forts.  All the kids in the neighborhood played together.  I never saw that kind of togetherness in any neighborhood after my childhood.    I did not start until I was 18.  I had a very strict upbringing and would not dare defy my parents.  My smoking was me busting into adulthood.  I still can feel that moment I coughed through my first cigarette and felt so cool.  I am sure I looked very foolish.
Like many, I started around 17 years old as a result of hanging around a buddy who also started at the same time - it was the cool, grown up thing to do in those days. Before then I was just a regular kid doing regular kid things.      The conversion from non smoker to smoker was seamless. The conversion from smoker back to non smoker ........ not so much
I grew up in Alabama and on occasion during the summers someone would sneak a smoke from their folks and we'd sit around acting cool. But my real smoking started in high school out here in California. I still remember the day I inhaled for the first time and my sister congratulating me!  That led to us putting our lunch money together to buy a pack of cigarettes for 52¢ a pack. When I finally quit, 35 years later, cigs were $5.68 a pack IF you bought them by the carton. Which being the dedicated smoker I was, I did

I regret all the time I wasted and the damage it caused my body but am grateful that I have had the last 2 years to get myself into a good place both physically and mentally since quitting.
    I can remember my life before smoking.      I was more a girly girl so no tree climbing for me. I would be more likely to be brushing my dolls hair or having a tea party for all my teddies.

I started smoking at 11...rebelled... Started hanging out with older kids ..and tried to keep up ...    From a early age I was sent to Ballet school....so most of my days were spent there...I was on blocks at the age of ten...  My life was a strict schedule... Hence the rebellion... My mother was obsessed ...  That rebellion cost me 52 years of my life ...  I would have loved to play in the mud and catch frogs ...
I had a great childhood.    Tadpoles, trees, horses for a spell.    We moved around every year or two and I LOVED that.     I remember at twelve or so, flying by myself somewhere. (we didn't have to be chaperoned back then) The ticket agent asked me,  'smoking or non-smoking'    I said, 'smoking'   because that's where all the hip people were.       I am thinking somewhere from 14-16, I was smoking.  Started hanging out with dealers, poets, musicians and pimps,   I was in such a hurry to be an adult.
    Doreensfree,    I was forced into ballet school, too.  I felt so out of place in ballet class that I used to deliberately hurt myself in attempts to get out of class.  LOL

Really I remember my life pretty well before smoking -- school, sports, running around with friends and going thru the high school life and all that came with that.  I did not start smoking until I went into the Army, smoking was part of the Army life then and it was so cheap to buy cigs.  Even got free cigs then with the c-rations at that time, so sad!!!Edited March 4 by Martian5
Memories...!        Building lots and lots of mysterious lego constructions, reading under the blankets with a flashlight, four years of ice skating(for which I lacked total talent), more reading, also catching tadpoles and watch them grow. I once went cleaning the bowl they were in and dropped it. We found dried mini frogs all year. I spent so much time with my younger sister, we did everything together. From annoying our parents to comforting eachother when they were having another one of their awfull fights.        I stole my first cigaret when I was 13, didnt have a clue how to light it. I almost choked and swore I would never start doing that, even pledged it in my diary. I recall writing something about vomiting and death, happy cheerfull kid that I was. One year later I was occasionaly having smokes with some of the badass neighbour kids and at 15 I spent my paper route money on Luckies. Which became John Player Special, Chesterfield, Gauloises, roll your owns Drum and later on Javaanse jongens 3/4.
I didnt start til I was 27, so childhood had already passed.
Wow, you didn't start till you were 27...that's got such a wholesome ring to it!
I started on/off smoking at 18 (post high school) and daily at 22 in college.  So, like JB, my child years were pretty much behind me       I was an avid cyclist.  Still am but I use my exercise bike more than my real one.  Waiting for warm weather to return.     I also remember having more hair back then.  Can I blame that on smoking too?

(here you go Amy) :)How do you feel about a friend who has to go everywhere with you? Not only does he tag along all the time, but since he is so offensive and vulgar, you become unwelcome when with him. He has a peculiar odor that sticks to you wherever you go. Others think both of you stink.He controls you totally. When he says jump, you jump. Sometimes in the middle of a blizzard or storm, he wants you to come to the store and pick him up. You would give your spouse hell if he or she did that to you all the time, but you can't argue with your friend. Sometimes, when you are out at a movie or play he says he wants you to go stand in the lobby with him and miss important scenes. Since he calls all the shots in your life, you go.Your friend doesn't like your choice of clothing either. Instead of politely telling you that you have lousy taste, he burns little holes in these items so you will want to throw them out. Sometimes, he tires of the furniture and gets rid of it too. Occasionally, he gets really nasty and decides the whole house must go.He gets pretty expensive to support. Not only is his knack of property destruction costly, but you must pay to keep him with you. In fact, he will cost you thousands of dollars over your lifetime. And you can count on one thing, he will never pay you a penny in return.Often at picnics you watch others playing vigorous activities and having lots of fun doing them. But your friend won't let you. He doesn't believe in physical activity. In his opinion, you are too old to have that kind of fun. So he kind of sits on your chest and makes it difficult for you to breathe. Now you don't want to go off and play with other people when you can't breathe, do you?Your friend does not believe in being healthy. He is really repulsed by the thought of you living a long and productive life. So, every chance he gets he makes you sick. He helps you catch colds and flu. Not just by running out in the middle of the lousy weather to pick him up at the store. He is more creative than that. He carries thousands of poisons with him which he constantly blows in your face. When you inhale some of them, they wipe out cilia in your lungs which would have helped you prevent these diseases.But colds and flu are just his form of child's play. He especially likes diseases that slowly cripple you - like emphysema. He considers this disease great. Once he gets you to have this, you will give up all your other friends, family, career goals, activities - everything. You will just sit home and caress him, telling him what a great friend he is while you desperately gasp for air.But eventually your friend tires of you. He decides he no longer wishes to have your company. Instead of letting you go your separate ways, he decides to kill you. He has a wonderful arsenal of weapons behind him. In fact, he has been plotting your death since the day you met him. He picked all the top killers in society and did everything in his power to ensure you would get one of them. He overworked your heart and lungs. He clogged up the arteries to your heart, brain, and every other part of your body. In case you were too strong to succumb to this, he constantly exposed you to cancer causing agents. He knew he would get you sooner or later.Well, this is the story of your "friend," your cigarette. No real friend would do all this to you. Cigarettes are the worst possible enemies you ever had. They are expensive, addictive, socially unacceptable, and deadly. Consider all this and - NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF! Joel© Joel Spitzer 1990

This was one of the first things I read at whyquit.com and it was one of the things that stuck to my grey matter.  :)
I'm going to add this to my 'must read' list if I get any wobbles over the next few weeks .... thankyou 
Found this at the back of the cupboard...
Doreen, thank you for this. Just read it to my other half who has quit with me and he asked me to send it to him so he can print out the words and keep them with him. He doesn't use the forums. He doesn't use NRT. He's doing this on willpower alone so I'm really pleased when I can help him in anyway. You should be too!  You're all cracking out the inspirational posts today!  Thank you for taking the time. X
Newbies and lurkers....for you....
For those of you 'romancing'  or hesitant to let go of nicotine addiction.  Great post from Soberjulie...an Excellent essay from Joel Spitzer (here you go Amy) :)How do you feel about a friend who has to go everywhere with you? Not only does he tag along all the time, but since he is so offensive and vulgar, you become unwelcome when with him. He has a peculiar odor that sticks to you wherever you go. Others think both of you stink.He controls you totally. When he says jump, you jump. Sometimes in the middle of a blizzard or storm, he wants you to come to the store and pick him up. You would give your spouse hell if he or she did that to you all the time, but you can't argue with your friend. Sometimes, when you are out at a movie or play he says he wants you to go stand in the lobby with him and miss important scenes. Since he calls all the shots in your life, you go.Your friend doesn't like your choice of clothing either. Instead of politely telling you that you have lousy taste, he burns little holes in these items so you will want to throw them out. Sometimes, he tires of the furniture and gets rid of it too. Occasionally, he gets really nasty and decides the whole house must go.He gets pretty expensive to support. Not only is his knack of property destruction costly, but you must pay to keep him with you. In fact, he will cost you thousands of dollars over your lifetime. And you can count on one thing, he will never pay you a penny in return.Often at picnics you watch others playing vigorous activities and having lots of fun doing them. But your friend won't let you. He doesn't believe in physical activity. In his opinion, you are too old to have that kind of fun. So he kind of sits on your chest and makes it difficult for you to breathe. Now you don't want to go off and play with other people when you can't breathe, do you?Your friend does not believe in being healthy. He is really repulsed by the thought of you living a long and productive life. So, every chance he gets he makes you sick. He helps you catch colds and flu. Not just by running out in the middle of the lousy weather to pick him up at the store. He is more creative than that. He carries thousands of poisons with him which he constantly blows in your face. When you inhale some of them, they wipe out cilia in your lungs which would have helped you prevent these diseases.But colds and flu are just his form of child's play. He especially likes diseases that slowly cripple you - like emphysema. He considers this disease great. Once he gets you to have this, you will give up all your other friends, family, career goals, activities - everything. You will just sit home and caress him, telling him what a great friend he is while you desperately gasp for air.But eventually your friend tires of you. He decides he no longer wishes to have your company. Instead of letting you go your separate ways, he decides to kill you. He has a wonderful arsenal of weapons behind him. In fact, he has been plotting your death since the day you met him. He picked all the top killers in society and did everything in his power to ensure you would get one of them. He overworked your heart and lungs. He clogged up the arteries to your heart, brain, and every other part of your body. In case you were too strong to succumb to this, he constantly exposed you to cancer causing agents. He knew he would get you sooner or later.Well, this is the story of your "friend," your cigarette. No real friend would do all this to you. Cigarettes are the worst possible enemies you ever had. They are expensive, addictive, socially unacceptable, and deadly. Consider all this and - NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF! Joel© Joel Spitzer 1990

    Damn Girl !  AAA ok I see you did not write this let me rephrase   Damn Joel !   I am not sure I would have ever associated smoking as a friend, more of a need   But if one was to embody smoking I think Joel has captured it (he or she) a relationship you wish had never started.  Think I'll print thi and take it with me tomorrow,      Thank you Julie for sharing it with us
Thanks for the bump Sazerak. This essay was always one of my favorites/most helpful, it really made me think about what I was doing with my smoking. I had it bookmarked for ready reading for my first 6 months.....
    One of the few essays that truly get to me.
    This has to be one of my favourite posts..I never tire reading it...    My friend my reward...geez....

Consider all this and - NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!                   Joel© Joel Spitzer 1990         Bump for @Lilly and all of us, really.  We were all such obedient slaves.
    Things are getting Better and Better, like this week end Family over fun, food,  alot of conversation, and not one thouight about smoking.  Death makes me want to smoke,  when I found my younger Brother dead is when I lasped .  Now My BHB Best Hunting Buddy Joe out of the Blue dies ?  and yes I wanted to smoke.  I did learn from my episode with my Brother althought it helped sooth my nerves and emotions it was very temporary and it put me right back on that smoking for no reason except to feed my addition. So with Joe I looked deper into myself to cope with not having him around anymore. I still need to take time to Grieve, I don't know,  what is grieve ? I will miss him,  I will have moments that his absence may overwhelm me at a moment.  But I will also have him in the Mountains, in the early morning fog, beside the camp fire.   So I am not sure if Grieve is correct.   Lets just say  I need to take time to say good bye, Love you and will miss you.  I will be assisting his wife in getting herself organized and the whole clearing of stuff.,    Sho and Joe both smoked  and I know I will need to be extra dilligent and stead fast when over there house helping.  I have made some preperations, I am bringing my son in law and my daughter both non smokers and both strong supporters of me not smoking.   so if I need a pep talk, hug or reinforment it is there.   You know back around Christmas I was writing about how good things were going and all seemed so bright and wonderful the future was looking and then one morning I woke up and was sucker punched right between the eyes, losing my Job, Bill my brother in law, Joe my Best hunting bud, it is amazing how fast life can turn on you.   Not much I can do about it except work my way through it,  Pull my man pants up and get to moving things back in to the sunlight.  Deep breathes, a tear hear and there when a moment floods in memory of Bill or Joe and new aventures ahead.   Looking at the difference between when My Brother passed and now I am so much more stable,  my thoughts are clearer,  my reasoning sharper, my strength and self assteem provide me the foundation to put into prospective and pritoritize what needs to be done, how to do it and when to stop and breath, close my eyes, to cleanse some of the emotional clutter.   I feel much better, the Vent has done what a vent should do.   Deep breath and  get ready for the final interview tomorrow.
    Aw man opah, sorry for the loss of your brother in law and  friend 
dear Opah, you are having a horrible time lately,  I am so sorry.   Don't make it all worse by smoking. Remember Cristóbal's WisdomYour Quit & Your Life        There are a lot of 'grief' sites out there  maybe one can help youTop 50 Web Sites and Forums For Grief Counseling
    I'm sorry for your losses Opah. It might not feel like it now but it gets better and easier... and smoking wont make that happen, only time will. I lost a friend and a family member within days of each other early in my quit and it was a close call at times but smoking wasn't going to help me heal and I am so glad I realised that. I think you know that too. I also lost my job as the business I had worked for closed down, being able to tell prospective employers I was a non-smoker certainly lifted my spirits.   Good luck with the interview.
    This post is so sad. I felt like it was just you and me when I read that.       So sorry for what you are going through - and have been through.        Rooting for you with your interview X x      
    Aww O....this is sad reading ...I'm sorry for your losses.....  Stay strong....and sending you a cyber hug x
I have desided to call it a day here at work, the DC is so quite, machines are still and I am having such a hard time setting here. Need to be "all that" tomorrow morning for this interview.   if all works out A job will not be one of the things i need to worry about, then  I can deal with the Loss of my Friends and family.   They say Death comes in 3s ?  if that is true I am done with it for the now,  Marky my younger brother, Bill  my brother in law and Joe makes 3.    Back to Deep breathes, and focus one the Immidiate   "The Interview"     God I miss being Young the Good old Days
So here I am Wednesday midle of the week and just read an Email stating thats it, we are dne, no possiblility or Hope of staying open.  you have 29 days of work and then Austa yo whaivos, arrivadurchy, any other way we need to say good bye.    29 days, I have spent the last 30 days selling my self on the internet, I have song my praise over the phone and pandered in person.    and a job is still not a positive.   I have had hard times in the Past and here I am  in all my glory, ready to take on this new challenge, I my younger I would Boast when your good your good, BUT when your better than good your Me and could pretty much prove it any day of the week.  So now Opah its time to prove it to your self,  are you as good as you once was ?       Nothing Better for the soul then a huge smile and a Cyber hug !Edited March 6 by Opah
    Hang in there Opah. Things have a way of working out    regardless of how much we worry or fret.    Protect your quit and be kind to yourself.  Reward yourself, you still need to be diligent in re-wiring your brain receptors.   So, take a nice walk. Do something that you really, really will enjoy.
0...as one door shuts ..another one opens ...its not over till the fat lady sings ...   Sending you that Smile and a Hug ....go pamper yourself on something good....your worth it .!!!!
    Big (((hug))) from me x
    WHOOO HOOOO,  Ive been Hugged
    Opah, we all hate those times in life that we have lost all control.  As difficult as those periods were hard to go through, they always make you grow and were changes that were meant to be.  I think you have a wonderful attitude and it will carry you through this.   You have a hug from me too.  Hang in there.
So sorry for your loses Opah. These last 3 out of four months have been a bit trying here as well. But the strange thing is every time I thought about a smoke for a second it vanished as quick as it came. I didn't even consider lighting up. It has been 4 months and I feel totally different than I have in 40 years. I don't feel like I have to have the damn things every time something bad happens and it sounds like you are almost there yourself. Don't give in now because you're there! I saw first hand what it looks like to go through the pain of needing the Nicobitch and I didn't realize I was once that way. It saddened me see her go through the desperation of needing that first smoke of the day and not able to have it, it had been14 hours, being around our grandkids. I actually hurt for her so bad that I told her to please consider and try to think about putting them down. Done rambling but Great job Opah, and keep on keepin on!
    Wantsit:    Your Rambles are my insperation, Thank you 
    I know you have a lot going on, Opah,   none of which will change for the better if you smoke.  Smoking will only bring you down.       At two months, your quit is young and tender.   Please, protect it and be extra kind to yourself.   These are crucial months of your successful quit.   Be aware of triggers and stay vigilant.     You are winning.  You Don't Smoke.
    You guys inspire me on a daily basis,  I realy am a Blessed man.  How antone could quit without a premire support group on their side is beyound me.   I hope there is someone out there peeking in on us, wondering if they could quit and see what a beautiful avenue this is to take.  in fact,         I know  i play this quit often but it really cheers me up and reminds me of us.   
I'm in another quitt group and quite a few do this and some reward themselves with a cruise on that lido deck for the 1 year anny
    I first kept seven to ten bucks a day between the pages of a book   which quickly became unweidly so, I switched to a big mason jar and watched my wealth like Midas.   Money or,  the accumulation thereof, was a huge motivation for me.       
Yup, when u see it. One guy put a picture of  a boat he always wanted with $ he saved . My ticker im at 12,000, put that cash in a jar
The recovered alcoholic, the heroin addict, the nicotine addict, deep down each knows the "Law of Addiction."  They've heard it over and over again.  Just one sip, one tiny fix, or one little puff of nicotine, just once, that's all it takes and the addict is back!  They know that either immediately or in a short period of time they'll once again be slaves to their old level of drug use or greater.  We know the Law of Addiction so why do we break it? There are three primary factors associated with relapse: (1) rewriting the law of addiction; (2) an excuse; and (3) a vague memory.  It doesn't matter if it happens within two hours, two days, two weeks, two months, two years, or twenty, the factors remain the same and apply to all of us.  Rewriting the law of addiction is easy and you don't need a pencil, paper or computer to do it. Amending the Law of Addition"Just one puff" and then "do not pass go, do not collect $200, but go directly to the addict's prison and surrender your freedom for good."  It isn't that the recovering nicotine addict doesn't know or believe the law of addiction because we do.  It's just that we begin to believe that we're the exception.  We convince ourselves that we're stronger and smarter than those who discovered the law, and wiser than all addicts who came before us.  We amend the law.  We put ourselves above it.  "Just one, it'll be ok, I can handle it, I'm stronger than the others, a little reward, it's been a while, I've earned it." I'm sorry.  As soon as such thoughts begin infecting the mind they tend to start feeding on themselves and in all likelihood your body's period of healing and freedom is over.  Your dreams and hard work are all being thrown into a dirty toilet that one puff of nicotine is about to flush. Instead of saying that you can handle "just one," a truthful statement would have been "I can handle them all, give them all back to me, my entire addiction, all the ashtrays, the coughs, the stink, the endless stream of 4,000 plus deadly chemicals that come with each puff (including up to 81 known cancer causing agents), the constant gradual destruction of every cell in my lungs and the gradual clogging and hardening of every blood vessel in my body, the 50/50 chance of killing myself 13-14 years early, all the money it will cost me to stay enslaved for years and years to come (together with massive future price increases designed to get me to quit), the growing social pressures that will make me feel even more like an outcast, I want it all back, all of it!" It's far easier for the junkie mind to create a one puff or one cigarette exception to the law" than admit the truth.  A one pack a day addiction is 7,300 cigarettes a year.  Don't picture smoking just one.  Instead, picture yourself sticking at least a year's supply into your mouth all at once. Try fitting them all into your mouth because in truth that's exactly where they'll be going, year after year after year.  "To thine own self be true."   You deserve the truth - you paid the price - you earned it. The Perfect ExcuseThe excuse can be anything.  Usually the addict waits for that great excuse to come along, but some get tired of waiting and any old excuse will do.  Even joy!  A reunion with an old smoking buddy, a few drinks with friends, a wedding, a graduation, or even a baby's birth and a free nicotine laden cigar, or trying a harmless looking new nicotine delivery device like the 27 flavors of suckers, the straw, lozenges, candy or even nicotine water or soda, why not!  But joyful or even stupid nicotine relapse is harder to explain to yourself and those you love. The smart nicotine addict waits for the great excuse, the one that we know we can sell to ourselves and others.  As sick as it may sound, the easiest to sell and the best of all is the death of a loved one.  Although everyone we love is destined to die and it'll happen sooner or later, for the reformed addict it's the perfect excuse for relapse.  I mean, who can blame us for ingesting highly addictive drugs into our bodies upon our mother's death.  Anyone who does would have to be extremely insensitive or totally heartless!  Right?  Losing a job, the end of a relationship, serious illness, disease or financial problems are all great excuses too - it's drug time again!  The addict is back! Lost MemoriesBut an excuse doesn't work alone.  It needs help.  Failing memories of "why" we were willing to put ourselves through the anxieties and emotion of physical withdrawal, and weeks and weeks of psychological adjustment in order to break free, breathe fatal life into any excuse.  Most of us failed to keep a detailed record of why we commenced recovery or what it was like.  Instead, we are forced to rely upon our memory to accurately and vividly preserve the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  But now, the memory in which we placed all our trust has failed us. It isn't that your memory is bad, faulty or doing anything wrong.  In fact, it's working as it should to preserve in as much detail as possible the joyful events of life, while forgetting, as quickly as possible, all the pain and anguish that we've felt, including our disdain for the addict's life we lived.  To have our brains do otherwise would make life inside our minds unbearable.  If women were forced to remember the true agony and intense pain of childbirth, most would have just one.  We are each blessed with the gift to forget. So how does the reformed nicotine addict who failed to keep accurate records of their journey revive their passion for freedom and recall liberty's price?  If we forget the past, are we destined to repeat it?  Not necessarily.  It doesn't have to be.  But just as any loving relationship needs nourishment to flourish, we can never take our recovery for granted or the flame will eventually die and the fire will go out.  We have to want to protect this glory until the day we die.  We have to turn that "want" into action.  If we do, we win.  If not, our fate may be up in the air with serious risk of relapse followed by crippling disease or even a very early grave. Whether it's daily, weekly or monthly, our recovery needs care.  If you don't have a detailed log to regularly review when faced with adversity, upon each anniversary of your quit, or at each birthday, do your best to create one now.  Talk to those still smoking and ask for help in revitalizing your memories.  Encourage them to be as truthful as possible.  Although they may look like they're enjoying their addiction to smoking nicotine, the primary joy they get is in keeping their body's blood serum nicotine level within the comfort zone, so as to avoid the onset of the anxieties and craves of early withdrawal.  Show them your pen and paper and invite them to help you create your list.  You may even cause a spark in them.  Be kind and sincere.  It wasn't long ago that those were our shoes. Also, try envisioning the first week. What was it like?  Can you still feel the powerful craves as your body begged and cried to be fed?  Can you still feel the pain?  Do you see yourself not being able to concentrate, having difficulty sleeping, feeling depressed, angry, irritable, frustrated, restless, with tremendous anxiety, a foggy mind, sweating palms, rapidly cycling emotions, irrational thinking, emotional outbursts or even the shakes?  Do you remember these things?  Do you remember the price you paid for freedom?  Do you remember why you were willing to pay it? If you have access to a computer, you won't need a smoker's help or even to recall the early days of your own journey.  You can go on-line to scores of smoking cessation support groups and find thousands of battles being fought, hear tons of cries and watch hundreds struggling for survival as they cling to the promise of the rich sense of inner calmness, quiet and comfort that lies beyond.  Visit as often as possible.  Make a few posts to those in need.  The most important thing you can tell them is the truth about why you are there.  Tell them how comfortable and complacent you've become.  It's what they yearn to hear!  Many smoked their entire adult life and have a difficult time believing that withdrawal isn't permanent.  Fear of the unknown is frightening.  Help them and in doing so help yourself. If you find yourself attempting to rewrite the law of addiction, stop, think, remember, read, revisit, revive and give to others, but most important, be honest with you.  Terrible and emotional events will happen in each of our lives - such is life.  Adding full-blown nicotine relapse to any situation won't fix, correct or undo your underlying concern.  In your mind, plan for disaster today.  How will you cope and keep your healing alive should the person you love most in this world suddenly die?  What will you do?  Remember, we've only traded places with our chemical dependency and the key to the cell is one puff of nicotine.  As long as we stay on this side of the bars, we are the jailors and our dependency the prisoner. We only have two choices. We can complete this temporary period of adjustment and enjoy comfortable probation for life or we can smoke nicotine, relapse, and intentionally inflict cruel and unusual punishment upon these innocent bodies for the remainder of their life, together with inviting a 50/50 chance that you'll be putting yourself to death. If the first choice sounds better - comfortable lifetime probation - then we each need only follow one simple rule - NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF! Breathe deep, hug hard, live long!John

Aww youre a sweetie. Its amazing how far reaching the addiction is, to call 7 months early (i believe you btw), then this is such a monumental jorney of perseverance its amazing
There will be a point when you stop abstaining and accept that you are done with smoking, it's over.  The struggle you feel will fall from you like a snowflake and you will be free.  Come back and tell us when it happens for you.
God knows i have 7 months on my belt and still feel like smoking it never really goes away does it...? It just decreases i guess... Are you unhappy about this ?  Does it bother you that you still feel like smoking ?
Breathe deep, hug hard, live long!JohnQuote shortened for space, however, this really needs to be at the top of EVERY page.   I wish I could have read this days ago....... even weeks.  
    Protect your quit,  friends.    Protect it with everything you have, everything you are.    Freedom from addiction is a generous reward for any toil or trouble you may experience  and our bodies are amazing healing machines when we give them the opportunity.

    This is a great post, thank you @Sazerac for bumping. I chronicled my journey through my first year and read it every monthaversary to remind myself where I started and how far I'd come. Unfortunately it was lost when our old board went down 
@jillar The loss of your archives is a terrible loss to you, to all of us.      I am so glad you and most of your gang are here creating new ones.
    For the newbies !!!
I am on another forum (nothing to do with smoking or not) but someone brought up how coffins just seemed like a waste of money, too much of a luxury for a corpse.  Anyways I mentioned not wanting to know any details of my own death. I am mid 40's and when I was 38, my mom died. That was kind of something that made me realize that death means business.   When I threw away my last cigarette in Oct 2017, one thing I had recurring thoughts of before I quit was, "What if this really does kill me early than I would like to die?     I mean my breath rattled at night, I could not laugh without coughing, everything stank of smoke, blood pressure was a little high...   I honest to God thought I would be dead by age 60 if I kept smoking. That is a little early. I would like to make it to at least age 75.        I just wonder if it's common for people in their 40's to start having recurring thoughts of death. If so, why would anyone this age or older STILL puff away on those cancer sticks?    Some of these young smokers do not think about death of course but they will someday.       Think about this - most forums lose members because they got banned over something, or maybe they got mad and just left. Forums like this sometimes lose members because their respiratory problems got the best of them. At what age though do smokers say, "Hmm, I would rather live a few more years than smoke this piece of crap cigarette".       Sometimes I still want a cigarette but I am not dieing for one.
    unfortunately....the fear of death and dying would make an addicted smoker...smoke more!  That's what I did...until I was truly ready       When the student is ready....the teacher appears
    I was in deep denial over health issues attributed to smoking   and if I ever thought about them,  I didn't care.   Health was not a factor in my quitting. My freedom was the main impetus.        I don't really have a fear of dying.    I still think I am going to live forever, lol.
     Some people don't value life like we do. They flat out dont care. My mother got a health scare when she couldn't breathe and quit, why wait till we get that scare? Most of us do, i have sinus issues and  i would always buy advil cold and sinus pills to open me back up instead of quitting... Took me years but after i quit i don't need the pills anymore . My good friend quit and it was after we were on the phone and we were laughing and he was choking he quit and went back, when i asked him why he went back he got upset so i stopped. Same goes for drinking, eating healthy. People get defensive and lash back at you when you try to help. When they ask i offer help now and i love that "When the student is ready....the teacher appears". Dead on... I like that one         
    I took the approach that I was dying for the day I was born, I might as well be "happy" while i was here cos I was gunna die anyway. I kid you not my health had nothing to do with quitting. I still can't pin why I quit probably money but more resentment that the smokes were in control not me.
    Cigarettes are just so addictive that even dying people can't stop smoking them.        I used to think people cared more about smoking than themselves and their families when they chose them over life. I even used to say I would rather live two years less and smoke than have the extra two years and be miserable without smoking.      Babs is spot on in that fear keeps smokers smoking more - even when they could die.         I think it was Reci who recently said something that sums this addiction up for me. He said something on the lines of the transition from non smoker to smoker is so easy but smoker to non smoker is not so easy. That's pretty much it in a nutshell.                          
    Smokers only fear that they might succeed in quitting.  It was years before I could tell myself that cigarettes were killing me.  If you are talking to someone about quitting, start by telling them not to be afraid.
    I think that most smokers figure out at some time that cigarettes are in fact compromising their quality of life and in fact may even die due to smoking.  That is when the fear might set in -- fear of no longer having a "lifelong friend" or dying to a enemy that they themselves have created (kind of a fear of their own stupidity).  These are thoughts that do not come up when we begin smoking but at some point this idea slaps us in the face, then we have to face what indeed is comfortable to us -- for me it was quitting!!!!
    '...The memory of her last few months haunts me. She was in so much pain and couldn't breathe. Watching your loved one go through something like this is heartbreaking and if this email stops just one person from taking a puff, then I feel that it's worth it.'  https://whyquit.com/whyquit/Memorial.html      Not only would you die early,  chances are you'd put your loved ones up with awfull memories. Ten times worse than just dying if you ask me.  These stories are actually real.   
Smoking takes all the fear of dying away... Last year I watched my best friend take her last breath hours after her last cigarette..... Thankfully I had the strength to quit ,when I got my health scare...me and my feet have had over 5 years more together..and God willing many more...
    The fact is the addiction always over road what the consequences were going to be.  I feared dying from smoking but also feared not smoking.  It wasn't until some kindhearted, caring people stood beside me and guided me to the other side.  I never thought I was strong enough to do it.  They showed me differently.  For that I will always be grateful and hope that I can help others.
    My perception of death or debilitating disease as a result of smoking was one thing when I was a smoker but is now completely different as a non-smoker.
I remember feeling very mortal early in my quit and actually still to this day. As a smoker I felt invinsible I suppose. Too busy smoking, too much in denial to see what's really happening.   But it was a lung cancer diagnosis that prompted my quit. And that young mum that got diagnosed did die shortly after diagnosis.    Her getting diagnosed just clicked something in me. She wasn't old. She was young. Had a wonderful husband...children. I dinny want that to me and seen for the first time ever that it could be.   So yes I think the thought of death is absolutely enough to make people quit. And it's really pretty straight forward once you realise these fags will kill you.    Other quit reasons in previous quits, those quits were hard for me and I never managed longer than 22 days.
"We're all gonna die from something...what are you gonna do?"       That and: "I could quit smoking and live longer, but where's the fun in that?"      I was an addict.  Any acknowledgement that my addiction was going to kill me was masked by denial and delusion.  Throw in a bit of gallows humor and I was ready to totally ignore the realities and consequences of my decision to continue smoking.       I was so delusional while smoking, I convinced myself that cigarettes were such an integral part of an enjoyable life that the risks involved with smoking were worth it.       Addiction breeds delusional thinking.  Delusional thinking shapes your perception.  Your perception becomes your reality.

One of those stories a man mentioned his brother died because he was addicted to Marlboros. Now I understand all cigarettes are equally lethal but something about that particular brand pisses me off. Might sound strange but I always thought of that company as the "asshole" of the tobacco industry. Of course I am not at all a fan of anything that is overly masculine.            9 hours ago, Doreensfree said:              Smoking takes all the fear of dying away...

That would **** with someone's head. But since you are quit and plan on keeping them until the end, might I recommend a few different brands of shoes -       Saucony makes the best overall street shoes. Good style, comfortable, durable, all at a fair price. Clark's makes some nice sandals.    B.O.C. makes the most comfortable high heel wedge sandals. The bottoms are cushioned so you won't die after 5 minutes of walking in them.

Havaianas make slightly fancy thongs in many pretty colours....Berkinstock make the overpriced thongs of Europeans and Hipsters.... Blundstone and RM Williams for ya boots, Dunlop for ya runners and UGGs for comfort.
    Thanks ladies ..for all your recommendations....    I'm so grateful to have my feet ..I do go for comfort now ...had to hang up my high heels....I treat them with respect....  Jo !!!!....love my Australian Hugg boots...best thing ever...
    Huff boots ... Yet more evidence of Australia's greatness....moccos are pretty good too.
    Just to remind folks ....It's not just your lungs and heart that smoking effects ....my lungs were fine...I didn't have a cough ...smoking can effect any part of the body ....and it not always where you expect ....  My friend had Pancreatic Cancer.....it was far to late by the time symptoms showed....when she was given her diagnosis ,she carried on smoking ...she believed all the lies that surround this killer addiction...very sad ...  In answer to your question  JB.....Yes ....I was very scared....    When I joined these great people ,I didn't know whether it was too late.... I owe this board alot ....

    I thought smoking would help me grow up faster so I could be an adult and call the shots in my own life.  For me, smoking was freedom.  I finally quit when I was out on a busy hiking trail, and there were older people trotting up mountains, and I was at the bottom gasping while my poor dog waited patiently by my side.   Other peoples' dogs were having a blast, running up the trail.  But my dog had to stand next to me while I wheezed and struggled, and it was just humiliating.  I wasn't thinking about my health, I was just thinking about my lack of dignity.  Sounds so crazy!!!  But there it is.  I just want my dignity, and I also want my genuine freedom, that I gave up the day I started smoking.  
    ^^^ Ironic isn't it ICH?    Started smoking  to find freedom yet now you will actually find freedom by quitting.
    You will get your Dignity. ICH......and a whole lot more ...Freedom is wonderful....soon youj,ll be running that fast,your dog will be panting....
my dad smoked till the day he died at the ripe old age of 56. and yet I smoked for years after word my self but 6 years ago I took my life back and quit. with a lot of help from the great people on here. I will be 56 july 12th so yes I does bother me. but I wont ever smoke again  so if you haven't quit do so now.  its so worth it. sorry my ticker is off but cant get it to count up. so just leaving it as is.Edited March 5 by jimmy
    Where you at Mona.....????? Give us a update .....
    Please help .       I want to restart now
    Hi      Congrats on Quitting        Just don't put anything in your mouth and set fire to it and you should be fine.        if you know why you started again it may be worth doing a list of things or situations to avoid for the first few months;       Post an SOS if you are struggling there is usually someone online to try to help you.
Thanks a lot for the reply despair not .        I have to think positive now .      First time my quit lasted for 6 days .  Second time it lasted for 24 days .     This time this has to be forever
    Let us just be clear.  You did not have to smoke, you chose to smoke. Don't do it again!
Try to remember that the first week is the hardest. Don't torture yourself by repeating the first week withdrawal over and over.        I avoided things that I associated with smoking so I didn't socialise much for 6 months and quit drinking. It worked for me.it may for you. Stick close to this site and read as much as you can to educate yourself.
    @Nancy , @despair not       Thanks for the tips     I will do everything i can to avoid it this time
    You can do it Redemption.  Take smoking off the table.  You don't "have to" smoke.  You choose to.   The secret to quitting is to choose not to smoke.  The control is all yours.  Stay close to the board and let us know when you are struggling most.  I can tell you that if you stick to it, over time, not smoking will become a non issue.  It truly will.
What happened when you all of a sudden chose to purchase and light up a cigarette again after 24 days smoke free? You need to understand what happened this time so you can avoid it again this time. What is your quit plan this time? Is it the same as last time? Last time you used nicotine gum to control your cravings. You have been on this site now for awhile yet you did not reach out to anyone here by posting an SOS on the SOS page. You might have been able to get past your situation if you had posted there and waited for at least 3 replies. SOS posts have saved a lot of quits in the past. I wish you the best in your renewed quit attempt. Please read as much as you can here and learn about nicotine addiction. Have you watched any of the Joel Spitzer Videos? There's a whole library of them on a separate page of the forum. They may help you understand much about this addiction and it's affects on us.
Redemption, it is very difficult to believe you seriously want to quit.  You have been on and off the forum for months.  You have never taken the Nope pledge in all your attempts.  That is all it takes is to pledge nope to smoking and stick to it.  It is not going to happen until you truly want it and work toward that goal.  Only you can change your life.  Edited December 23, 2018 by Linda Thomas
Good to see you back redemption. It took me 7 times to get my forever quit. You will get there. Seems like drink and stress was trigger? Some people do say avoid alcohol early in your quit so maybe you should consider that?

Neither in The Pledge Post, nor any other   A "pledge" is bullsh|t.     Hundreds here. Thousands elsewhere. Millions everywhere, each and every year participate in some sort of pledge or promise...   And yet they still smoke.   A pledge is neither necessary, nor sufficient ... and for most it is a lie.     The only thing that matters is to ACTUALLY PRACTICE Nope.   Practicing Nope is both necessary, and sufficient.  ALL successful quitters live the Nope.  Anyone can write/say some words and pledge the Nope.    Successful Quitters live the Nope.  EZPZ
    The Daily Nope can for many be a powerful tool....and can make the difference between smoking or not ....   Anything that helps us along has got to be good thing ..... Everyone is different ...every quit is different ....   I pledged myself for a long time ...    As long as you keep the promise you pledged ....I say ...go for it ....
    ^^^ I agree that the physical and mental process of actually making that pledge daily, even if it's just silently to yourself, is what sets up the motivation to stay smoke free for that day with many folks. Of course it doesn't mean anything if a person doesn't follow though on it but it's like making a promise to someone else about something. Those don't mean anything either if they aren't kept but speaking the words to start off with defines what kind of a person you are based on the end results and I think most folk want to be seen as decent people who are true to their word. Making the pledge daily certainly doesn't hurt anyone but the person making it if it isn't followed up on.

    I never pledged. But respect the thought of it.     Sgt and everyone else can be right at same time.

It was very important to me to not only affirm to myself that I wasn't going to smoke that day but also to stand with my fellow NOPers as united in beating this addiction.
    I don't pledge nope therefore it's certainly not all it takes to quit!!         But I wouldn't scoff at those who pledge nope or those who do not.      Just do what ever works for you.             
    NOPE, as a concept  and     NOPE,  as a personal commitment were v. helpful to me in my quit.   Now, the commitment holds   and for me, it is a sense of joyful camaraderie     that continues to encourage me in the NOPE thread.

I do feel the same @Sazerac.  I would wake up many days over the years and say I wasn't going to smoke anymore but did not hold to it.  Pledging with my friends and supporters was different.  They believed in me more than I did and gave me the strength to not let them down!
    Awesome but still not required reading....  Sgt by no means meant it personal....he is his own person but never personal offending people...ideas sure. But we are all on the same side here.   Whatever works.

    You might get help if you tell people why you smoked.       Please don't take this the wrong way but every time you relapse you don't want to be stopped. That is why you tell the forum after you do it. I have done it myself lots of times which is why I recognise it.      It's a bit like people who are only sorry they were unfaithful because they got caught.         I'm glad you've quit again

    I have tried hundreds of times to quit and the only thing that has worked so far is this forum. I check it every day. I also try to nope pledge  everyday. The nope pledge might be symbolic but it is a ritual that I find very useful. Rituals are not fantasy and forming new habits to replace smoking is key. I feel like rituals, habits, pledges all are part of "process", the process of not smoking.
Redemption 3,       You say that you want to restart smoking, but I'd like you to look a bit deeper.     You want to quit smoking.  If you didn't, you would never had quit to begin with.      It's actually the addiction that wants you to restart.          The longer you abstain from smoking the more removed the addiction will be from your person.     Never think for a moment that you want to smoke.
Sgt. Barney,        I gather from the fecal matter present in your posts that you have nothing but contempt     for verbalized commitments.         I did quit and I did, on occasion, pledge.      It can help us conceptualize what we want (or don't want)   and help to renew our commitment by making it a daily,  verbalized, focus of attention.     By making the pledge in public we magnify the commitment as we incur social expectations    and well wishes ...or disappointment.       A pledge is just another tool in our arsenal.       I confess that I am morbidly curious how you might value the concept of prayer in terms of  its usefulness in defeating addiction as, while very similar,  a prayer is an externalized plea wherein a pledge tends to be more of a internalized affirmation.                                                             Edited December 28, 2018 by Sirius
    I think sgt.barney might just be saying a pledge is not enough to stop someone from smoking.        I'm pretty sure if you went back through every pledge thread from when this forum started you would find a lot of people who still relapsed. Everyone who gets married takes a pledge to be with that person forever but look at how many end up in divorce.        I'm certainly not saying the pledge is useless because it clearly helps a lot of people. The truth is though that despite what tools we use none of them can stop us smoking. The only thing that stops us smoking is us.       My humble opinion - don't let pledges, NRT, forums or anything else take any credit. The one thing actually keeping a quit is YOU.       
    Support comes in all shapes and sizes here...   Some is very fluffy..hitting you with a feather duster....there there....stop it ....don't smoke ...    Some use patience...keep on and on and on and on .....telling you smoking is bad for you ...please please stop....  I tend to whack you with a frying pan...if you keep wanting to smoke after you have  quit ...   And some come in wearing boxing gloves... Fighting ...straight talking .... It's what makes this place work ... This is your quit !!!!.....no one else's....it's your life your fighting for ....do whatever you need to ,  Never stick anything in your mouth and smoke it ....NOPE !!!
Personally...pledging helped me keep my quit.... because if I publicly declared it then I felt that I needed to keep my word not to myself but to others.... BUT that's me... My very dear quit buddy Weegie didn't/doesn't NOPE but she is just as successful as i, she didn't need it and I think that is just fine and dandy and she never told me I was wrong or delusional for needing to NOPE never implied it made me a weaker person or a subpar quitter but because she was my mate she supported my need to nope.. just as I supported her need not to NOPE.... me mate Saz.. she quit cold turkey... and me I used NRT for 9 weeks... but hey both of us have kept our quit, neither of us did it the wrong way or a bullshit way... we did it the way that worked for us...and you know what I don't judge those that use methods different to the way that worked for me and I don't disparage those different methods... because why put someone else off or belittle something they find beneficial just because you didn't, let them take the steps they need to get to the end goal without shitting all over them.        Recently I have felt a degree of negativity creeping in here and that anything that deviates from an easy, cold turkey quit is sub par. Its no one person in particular, but its like there is becoming a divide between how one should or should not quit and that is bullshit. You know how one should quit??... whatever bloody way works for them!!. It's kind of off putting and I'm comfy with my quit. I thought the QT was a community to support others in their quit process not to put down anyone who deviates from what worked for you or to belittle and mock what works for another. Or cast doubt on another's approach. Everyone needs to step back, take a deep breath, and chill..... but please don't suggest we sing Kumbaya.      Everyone here has something of value to add, lets respect each other enough to let them say it. Sure we can disagree but we can disagree without mocking or insulting the alternate opinion... who can throw the biggest insult has nothing to do with winning an argument and just makes your opinion seem tacky and loose value. See the way I see it we all have a right to our opinions and unless someone is on here saying the only way to successfully quit is to sacrafice a kitten at dawn each day... is it really any skin off your nose if the advice they offer doesn't match your experience. Sure, share that you disagree, hell I'll argue for your right to disagree, we need diversity, but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater just cos it didn't work for you.      Now just saying... only 2 months ago anyone had of told our @Linda Thomas her NOPE pledge was bullshit and meant nothing she would have slinked away and probably never come back, possibly had a smoke or 10 too, but our girl done gone and growed herself a big set of hairy quit balls (kinda proud down here in Aus).... so sure, disagree with each other, the varied opinions and approaches are what make the QT work but please do so and still respect the other person's right to have an opinion that is different and not mock, insult or belittle them. Sure there are failed quitters who NOPEd every day... but there are also quitters in there who have been NOPEing for 3 years or more so sweeping generalisations that it means nothing and is pointless are just that..... pointless. Cbdave and Johnny5 NOPE every day... along with a cast of others... who are all successful at being quit... there is some evidence that for some it does work... for some it is a necessary ritual and lets rejoice at the difference ... how boring would life be if we all were the same.         Now as someone else liked to say "let's get this thread back on track"... this comments for @Redemption3 .... hope you are still quit.... No issue with wanting to start again... because lots of us have had more than one quit start... but mate, lets get serious here, lets put our big boy (and girl) pants on and have a good hard look at things... you can start again, and again, and again... keep starting when you fail because one day it will stick... but you need to learn from the failed quits... you need to own the fact you are an addict and Potts mate, you need to be honest with yourself... this is not your third quit... not since you joined the boards at least... you have had multiple quits, know how I know, because I have been here for all of them... its not just 2.. I am pointing this out because you need to be honest with yourself to be successful at quitting. Your 2 best quits have been 6 days and 24 days... but there have been many other 3-4 day quits in there since you joined. You can quit... for good, for ever, but you have to be strong enough to not smoke. You don't loose a quit, you throw it away... we can't do this for you mate, none of us have the miracle cure, we all went about it different ways... some of us read everything we could, some of us played all the games.... some of us posted silly pictures of cats and made bad jokes... some of us swapped recipes and exercise tips... some of us used NRT... some of us relapsed again, and again...some of us pledged... but all of us did not put something in our mouth and did not set it on fire. For some of us it is as easy as saying I don't smoke anymore and they are done, the evidence is in, some people are just that fortunate to have that much willpower.... then others of us battle every day to fight the urge to smoke, getting stronger everyday.... and then others fall somewhere in the middle... What I do know is you want to quit, you wouldn't keep going through those first 3 days if you didn't... you wouldn't keep posting here, copping criticism if you didn't really want to quit... I suspect there is a degree that your posts get twisted with meanings due to English not being your first language... but I wasn't going to post here for 2 reasons... 1 "I had to smoke"... you didn't have to smoke, you wanted to smoke... lets be honest buddy... you did not have to smoke, you life did not depend on it, nooone held a gun to your head, stuck a smoke in your mouth and told you to smoke... you chose to smoke... where was the sos??? where was the hey QT I am day 24 but a want to smoke .... nope you smoked, and then you came back and said I want to start again.... of course you want to quit again... there is no benefit to smoking... being smoke free is wonderful (after you get past the worst of the craves, and thoughts)....and 2 because you need to be honest with yourself and accept you are an addict.. which I don't think you do.... Just do one thing for me... let me know what you learnt from the last time you lost your quit... use those lessons to grow this quit into your forever quit.
    Great post Jo! Well put.    This is a place of support for anyone and everyone who truly wants to quit, no matter what their methods. 
    I've been here for over five years ....this is the first time of my knowledge that the NOP E thread ,has ever come to be questioned ....    It's here for a reason....  It a daily pledge you won't smoke that day ...a promise to yourself ....    Yes OK...some have pledged and then later smoked ...thier choice to break a promise ...but the help and support it gives to the those that  keep their promise is as  I have said before .  Very powerful...    No one here should be made to feel uncomfortable in Pledging ...it's a choice ....  I just want to add...I love watching those pledges ,some are very funny ...and clever...
    Let's not get caught up in majoring in the minors.      If the pledge works for you, do it.     If the pledge is something that you don't care about, forget it.        The only compulsory rule for a successful quit is this: Do Not Smoke!       "The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing." --Stephen R. Covey
    The NOPE pledge worked for me because I would never break a pledge to myself.  Once it was done each morning, I knew I had to make it through that day.  Then I got to choose again the next day.

Quitting smoking isn't forever. It's just this moment, this hour, just today.   As long as you stay present-focused, and you're saying, "not today," you'll achieve your goal.      For me, when it's night and it's dark, my willpower wanes and I crave more intensely.   When I'm asleep, I don't crave, so I go to bed early. As early as 5:30 or 6:00 pm on occasion.  When I wake up, I am stronger and still present-focused: "Not this moment, not this hour, not today."
I pointed this out when I was new to the forum and nearly got banned over it.   I guess for some it helps though. For me, I just got tired of all the BS that came with smoking and decided to clean house.     Of course at first I didn't have too hard a time quitting and people got mad over that also. I was thinking, "Excuse me for having some G.D. willpower".                On 12/28/2018 at 11:28 PM, sgt.barney said:                                 If a pledge were worth a shit, no one on this forum (or any other) taking said pledge would smoke.          The evidence is in.

    JB I don't think it was so much that you spoke about how easy it was for you but more the way you spoke about it that got other's backs up.         Sure you have every right to be proud of your will power and how easy you had it, you earnt that pride but to those of us that struggled, or who used different methods to quit than the way you posted about it came across as condescending and as a put down as if anyone who was struggling or had a different quit to how yours was were inferior. I think that was what upset others.     Personally I read back post of yours that triggered me early in my quit and I can see what it was that triggered me but it was equally about my own insecurities with my quit. Some of your earlier posts if you did them again now I'd probably still jump down ya throat for em but it would be more because they can be off putting to newbies or lurkers cos they could be quite negative....that said...we all have different experiences to bring to the board and for every person who doesn't appreciate your approach there will be someone who does. 
    Part of what helped me ease off the cancer sticks though - for about two years prior I mostly smoked roll-your-own smokes. The Top-o-matic machine with the crank handle that crammed tobacco into a tube.  The tobacco sold in bags is cheap for a reason - it sucks. Probably lower nicotine. It is like the "low calorie" version of your favorite comfort food.     I do not know how easy or hard it would have been if I were smoking real cigarettes.
Hello , i have not been able to post about my quitting journey for a while now but ,    I have not smoked any cigarettes since the last 3 weeks .       Well its been really more than 3 weeks away from smoke .        And i am very happy these days .        I have been using nicotine gums for the past 3 weeks .      I had no mood to post for the last few weeks , because it was mostly talking a pledge and breaking it after a week or two .     But this time i did it .        I do not remember the exact date but i am sure it been more than 3 weeks .      I feel a lot more healthier now     What i learned is that , talking to the right people is so important and talking to the wrong people can make you feel mental .     Some people are simply useless talking to
    Well Potts, it is good to see you back and I hope this is the final time for you.  
    Thanks for the reply Linda ,        I am taking another break from the forums .     Sometimes it so important to talk something else .      I have been looking for some other good health related discussion forum too .       Anyway i will be back after February .      Now i know all the tricks and tools to avoid smoking
Welcome back Potts.     >3 weeks is nearly a month buddy... whatever you are doing stick to it... its working.
An interesting exchange of ideas and a fairly civil discourse I might add. I feel for the relapse and am glad for anyone back on the wagon (Train).     The mechanics of NOPE are flawless and living it assures perfection,  and a forever quit. There are other ways that lead to the same end, and having seen those struggles and final successes over the years prove that these alternative paths are effective as well.      But in the end it's all about staying quit isn't it, pledging and doing or living the NOPE?         After all of the hyperbole, no matter how you choose to get there you will never achieve freedom from addiction to nicotine by delivering more nicotine into your system. The Law of Addiction paraphrased I suppose.       KTQ     Markus      Quit 2-18-2008   Edited February 27 by Markus11Para
End of February too , No smoke went in  .       Some cravings in 2 or 3 days , i go out and eat a nicotine gum and its gone .       I think it is officially over .     Thank god
Um Potts....wot is your quit date? Are you nearly 2 months smoke free? This is awesome news! You sneaky quitter hiding in the background.. please let us know how long smoke free so we can all celebrate with you.
"I think it is officially over"     Be careful:  that can be a dangerous attitude at what is still an early point in your recovery.  Remain vigilant--your life depends on it.      Christian 99    17+ Years Quit
@notsmokinjo        Thanks for the reply        I have clearly finished 2 months without smoking . I feel really good , there was cravings but it was not that strong .     I have even managed to avoid smoking without using gums for at least 7 days .       I keep buying these gums these days so that i can chew it whenever i feel really bored .        One important thing i learned is that the cravings for a smoke is always there , you simply stop thinking about cigarettes .That is the best way to avoid it .      I don't even think about cigarettes  much these days , It does not interest me anymore , which is a really good thing .         @Christian99        Thanks for the reply .      Well , whenever i get bored i think of everything else other than cigarettes .      Thanks for all the support
    "cravings for a smoke is always there"  This is untrue. Cravings exist while you maintain your addiction to nicotine.   When you quit nicotine, cravings fade away.
Fuzzy memories of a member who touted a 10 year quit, then one day on the boards copped to 6 years of it having a nicotine gum habit. Can't you feel that hell behind the skull bones, and the devil crunching the numbers?         Whatever works, but that formula never includes more nicotine delivery long term. Smoke free is a start, but nicotine free is the monkey off of your back. Its an affliction.  This whole quit thing is a mind game, so choose wisely, no matter how much you think you have it clinched, be it  a month or a decade free.      KTQ     Markus      Quit 2-18-2008
Next stop no more NRT gum...but mate be very proud of your 2 months smoke free....that's huge and you have done it....I was still using NRT at 2 months too....it got much easier when I stopped the nrt...the smoking thoughts were less too.  My goal was to be NRT free by 3months...I think I went a little over...but I new when it was time for me and you will too.
My thoughts about NRT gum was always - "wow, that is not cheap! Wouldn't it be cheaper to quit cold turkey?"    I don't know, it just seemed like taking up smoking cessation of any kind would just be a lateral move. Plus some commercials had people saying, "I tried everything. slowing down, gums, patches, hypnosis, nothing worked... but then this new product came along." I thought "Well if none of those things work to make someone quit smoking, why waste cash on them? And what if this "new" product failed? Even when I was a kid and thought "I will never smoke", somehow I knew cessation products were a load of bull.              20 hours ago, Markus11 said:                Fuzzy memories of a member who touted a 10 year quit, then one day on the boards copped to 6 years of it having a nicotine gum habit.

    NRT worked for me Potts...took the edge off enough so my crazy arse could get over that quit line....so it does work for some....and for others it doesn't....but it's working for you too so keep learning.
    I remember the 'intense face with uninterested posture' was one of the aspects of smoking I liked doing, as a teen. It was undeniable: 'Wow that girl is one with her cigaret and look how she LIVES that attitude'.        They feel the same in Sons of Anarchy. Luckily they get to blow party whistles!          
    What is a crime is you carry on Smoking !!!!    Ok you have failed ,maybe more than once ....so what !!!!!..... Keep going ...keep trying ....do you really what to end up with a smokers illness..or worse ??? Just put it behind you ...and start again....   What have you got to lose ..NOTHING.....but could gain...EVERYTHING.....    Do it today !!!!!
    Never give up giving up....because eventually you will get your sticky quit....but you have to try.. if at first you don't succeed, try and try again...learn from each attempt, take away the he positives...focus on those.
    No, relapsing is not a crime.   If that were the case, there's a few here that would be on death row in San Quentin by now for the number of relapses.
    Quitting is serious business and not often a walk in the park in the beginning. You must 'Embrace The Suck' as our friend, The Sarge, says and hold tight to your resolve.      Your commitment to yourself is fundamental as is understanding the addiction.   The rewards are innumerable and you will never regret quitting  you will only regret not quitting sooner.    
I agree relapsing is not a crime.   It is a big deal,   Not a crime.    It is an alarm to let you know it is time to re-evaluate.   Re-evaluate your reasons for quitting.  Re-evaluate your readiness to quit. Re-evaluate your real knowledge of your addiction.  Re-evaluate the relapse.    Toss the pack, take a shower, brush your teeth and  Restart your quit STAT.Edited February 28 by Lust4Life
    If the Sarge were here, he might say -  "Crap or get off the pot"        
    Pity we can't all have loose bowls..takes some a while longer to work their shit out.
Relapsing doesn't mean that you can't quit smoking and certainly doesn't mean that you shouldn't quit smoking immediately.  If you've relapsed, it's important to understand this addiction and more importantly to treat your smoking as a drug addiction and work at keeping your life free of cigarette smoking and nicotine regardless of the delivery method.      Relapsing isn't a crime but smoking is punishable by death.      Video discusses the concept of whether a cigarette induced death should be considered a murder, suicide or an accident.        "So I failed in quitting smoking, big deal. I'm not going to feel guilty or be hard on myself. I mean, it is only cigarette smoking - it is not like a crime punishable by death." I had to refrain from laughing at this statement. It was seriously quoted to me by a clinic participant who failed to abstain from smoking for even two days. She had the same old excuses of new job, family pressures, too many other changes going on.        But to say that cigarette smoking isn't a crime punishable by death - that was news to me. According to the United Nations, tobacco kills 4.9 million users per year. While we know that these people were killed by tobacco, it is hard to classify these deaths. Were they murders, suicides or accidents?        When examining the influence of the tobacco industry, one is tempted to call all tobacco related deaths murder. The tobacco industry uses manipulative advertising trying to make smoking appear harmless, sexy, sophisticated, and adult. These tactics help manipulate adults and kids into experimenting with this highly addictive substance. The tobacco industry knows that if they can just get people started, they can hook them on cigarettes and milk them for thousands of dollars over the smokers' lifetimes.     The tobacco institute always contradicts the research of all credible medical institutions that have unanimously stated that cigarettes are lethal. The tobacco institute tries to make people believe that all these attacks on cigarettes are lies. If the medical profession was going to mislead the public about cigarettes, it would be by minimizing the dangers, not exaggerating them. The medical profession has a vested interest in people continuing to smoke. After all, the more people smoke, the more work there is in treating serious and deadly diseases. But the medical profession recognizes its professional and moral obligation to help people be healthier. On the other hand, the tobacco industry's only goal is to get people to smoke, no matter what the cost.      It could be argued that a smoking death is suicide. While the tobacco industry may dismiss the dangers, any smoker with even average intelligence knows that cigarettes are bad for health but continues to smoke anyway. But I do not believe in classifying most of the smoking deaths as suicidal. Although a smoker knows the risk and still doesn't stop, it is not that he is trying to kill himself. He smokes because he doesn't know how to stop.      A smoking related death is more accidental than suicidal. For while the smoker may die today, his death was in great part due to his first puffs twenty or more years ago. When he started smoking the dangers were unknown. Society made smoking acceptable, if not mandatory in certain groups. Not only did he not know the danger, but also he was unaware of the addictive nature of nicotine. So by the time the dangers were known, he was hooked into what he believed was a permanent way of life. Any smoker can quit, but unfortunately many don't know how.     Whatever the classification–murder, suicide or accident–the end result is the same. You still have a chance, you are alive, and you know how to quit. Take advantage of this knowledge. Don't become a smoking statistic – NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!     © Joel Spitzer 1983
I smoked a pack of JACS tonight.  Tsk tsk for shame on me. Maybe not a whole pack.  A bunch of tokes over the course of an hour or so.  I'm over 2 years quit and I needed my fix.  Life happens.  People suck.  Wine is delicious. A moment to reflect.  To feel, think, hear my breath, feel my lungs inflate.   Inflate with the unaltered air surrounding me.   JACs are Jillar's Air Cigs.  I coined the phrase in 2016.  Back then I was a straw smoker.  It worked.  For me and maybe others.  The battle I fought wasn't really the nicotine.  It was the ritual.  The inhales and exhales.  Screw yoga.  There was something therapeutic about watching the smoke.  I tried NON-nicotine alternatives to mimic the fluid dynamics of those streams- before I quit quitting and Quit.  The "smoke" was therapeutic.   This is another battle to fight and overcome when quitting.  So much is focused on the nicotine addiction.  There is a mental addiction that is, for some like me, more difficult to overcome.        So- for those like me that were more addicted to the act of smoking- do not be ashamed to pretend to smoke thr/ a straw or thr/ your own pursed lips against your fingers.  The end usually justifies the means.  Figure out how and why you wish to live a longer and healthier life and make it happen.  It will suck along the way.  Be sure to stop and breathe unaltered air.
    Yeah, going through the motions without inhaling nicotine is harmless. Placebo effect maybe.    It is kind of like punching something soft and pretending it is the neighbor or boss you hate. It offers a small part of the satisfaction but with none of the consequence.
    No question in my mind that all the other things surrounding nicotine addiction are the things that take the longest to readjust to. Otherwise, we'd be fine after a few days not pumping nicotine into our bodies. Oh no. It's all those mental associations we need to break. That's what takes the time and is what really tests our determination to break free of this addiction once and for all.
    I missed the ceremony of Fire.  Not clear on whether I really missed it or if it was the voice of the addict.   I used matches to start my stove instead of the automatic spark for a while then, forgot about the 'ceremony of Fire'.   
    I also used deep breathing but, didn't need the hand to mouth action so much.       Taking a break on my back stoop to think with a smoke was a serious pattern but,    taking the break on my back stoop to think and breathe became the sustainable ritual.   Oxygen is delicious.
Oh yes lust, you know I love my JAC too. I still use it from time to time.  Edited February 22 by jillar
    Regular gum.... Had to keep my mouth busy....my punching pillow for those moments when I needed to let go of some steam !!!!
    I remember the JAC and good to see that most here understand the what ever it takes is good,    if sucking on a sraw, pincel, pretzel or what ever helps ease that nagging I want to smoke urge its a good thing.   For me it was and is Hard candy and I have sucked a long hard slow breath between my puckered lips on more  than one occation.  Thank you Jill its been a while and I really want you to know,  you were, you are and you always will be appreciated
Sarge sucked on an empty E-Cig for a good 3 weeks.  Shaped like a cigarette. Looked like a cigarette. Gave him something to put in his hands and suck on like a cigarette ... but just sucking air. Sarge's Pops tried quitting with E-Cigs and it still hasn't worked for Pops Sarge to this day ... but the empty sucking of air really worked in those first few weeks for Sarge himself.    EZPZ

    So for me, the most disturbing statement in that is big tobacco identifying vaping as "a potentially safer alternative" ..... 'potentially' playing semantics for defense against future class actions. 
Gday    bigbtabacco would love to be able to sell nicotine vapes in Australia. Sure they love to see in law so they could get a monoply again.  But no one can sell nicotine vape. That’s everyone! As an individual you can buy and import a personal supply. When I checked it was a max of 3 months personal  supply.    But you can’t sell it. That’s illegal.  Off course big tabacco is pissed off cause it can’t control the market! WA is illegal to sell vape equipement of any sort which is diferent to the other states. Big tabacco would love to explote that difference. But from what I’ve read the evidence coming in from around the world doesn’t support the much touted therory that vaping is a pathway to giving up smoking but rather that it has little effect in cutting smoking rates. Big tabacco hasn’t got much to fight with!

It’s been 2 years since I’ve had a smoke.That’s roughly 15,000 cigarettes not smoked. That number blows my mind.        2 years since I decided that living is more important than choosing to slowly kill myself.      2 years since I decided it was more important to grow old with the one that I love than to put something in my mouth and light it on fire.      It seems so long ago and far away that I hardly remember what it was like to be a smoker and sometimes even forget that I was.      2 years of freedom      It makes me mad that my old man, who was a hell of a lot tougher than I am, couldn’t quit. He’d give it up for lent every year (and what a miserable 40 days that was), but he’d start right back up every time.        It makes me sad that he chose smoking over me and my brothers and sisters. Cigarettes were more important than living to see his children and grandchildren grow old.   He smoked up to his final days and took his last breath at the age of 56. I think he would have been a cool old man, but I’ll never know.       **** cigarettes
you Know what makes me Mad !  My Father never smoked, Never Drank, didn't use salt, road his Bicycle to work and back every day for years,His biggest sin Dr Pepper.  He died of a Massive Heart attack age 67, that is seven years more than I am now.     Super work on your two years Jim, I know the Forum would rather see you still quit than to Spank you with the wet noddles.      Keep up the Great work,  Its good to have successful quiter to look up to.  Once again Jim
Warmest congrats on 2 years, Jim!       Christian99
G’day Jim   2 years.... sounds so simple, but if I remember rightly it wasn’t all plain sailing for you. You fell off the wagon and had to get back up. Well done and well deserved 2 years C
You do not remember correctly.  I quit on Feb 9 2017 and haven't touched a cigarette since. I didn't "fall off the wagon".      Thanks though.
I cannot help but wonder why your dad never just quit completely if he was able to make it 40 days without. We all know the crave cycles and we also know if one can make it for 40 days, then staying off the cigarettes is not that hard by that point. The worst is the first week.      Assuming he passed roughly 20 years ago,  back then there wasn't as much support for people trying to quit.
    Same reason millions of people die from smoking. He didn't want to quit. He loved smoking and didn't care that it would kill him.

Jim congratulations on your 2 year quit.    It is so sad that you think of your dad that way.  I don't think his smoking had anything to do with the love of his children.      I can tell you that, until I found this forum, I had tried many times to quit and  I grieved that I could not quit for my children and grandchildren.   I was fortunate enough to find people like you to guide me through to my freedom.   I am so grateful to follow your example.

He loved smoking and didn't care that it would kill him.               I think a lot of us enjoyed the calming effect.  We enjoyed that, but no the bad parts. I imagine though when someone dies of smoking related illness, they probably didn't truly believe smoking would kill them. Some of us though, like myself, kept thinking, "What if I really could die early from smoking?"  Maybe some just come to that realization way too late.
Here is a vid from, our friend, Joel     I know I wanted to 'push the river'and be completely done with craves or triggers quickly (like immediately !)but, to be realistic, it was a full year and a bit more for craves and triggers to back off into oblivion.    In fact, at 10 months, I had a big hurdle.  I was having craves and using them to get in the way of my work (painting).It was akin to writers block but, I was blaming nicotine and whining about quitting.The addiction had changed so many brain receptors and I hadn't dealt with all of them.Not a little disheartened, I wrote in my blogMy Life As One Big Smoke Triggerand the response was heartening.Paul, Action, Marti, Chrysalis and Tinkall gave me their encouragement and I was able to push through.    So, if you are well into your quit and still having moments of despair,please hang on.  It gets better.  You get stronger and your brain gets reclaimed.It just takes time.
    I don't experience cravings anymore.        Let me rephrase that.   I have not experienced a craving in quite some time.        Same with the smoking dreams.  That stuff is in the past.       If I am around people who smoke there is no trigger.  Just a mild annoyance.        You are free from smoking when its no longer a question you bother to ask.      As Sazerac says, it just takes time.
    The craves disappear.       All of them. After a few  years, there are only old memories left.      If they did not, we would never quit smoking permanently.           Cristóbal
Been smoke free for 5 weeks and the cravings are still driving me crazy... I gave in today. I had 2 cigs and they tasted horrible but they did soothe the goddamn itch that I’ve been struggling with for weeks. This is the first time I’ve smoked since my quit date. I’m so tired of distracting myself and I’m all out of willpower. I don’t want to relapse although that would be so easy at this point. Are these cravings ever going to go away? And when do I get my energy back? All I want to do is sleep lately..... I’m getting fat and no one even cares about or supports me quitting. Feels like I’ve taken my only coping strategy away from myself and now I’m just depressed and socially anxious. Edited February 17 by del
Del - you're in a terrible spot. 2 cigs is a relapse. The cravings will eventually become something that don't seem so overwhelming, but only if you don't never have another puff.     Take a breath, remember the things that helped you decide to quit. If you don't smoke then smoking can't hurt your health any further. Smoking can't rob you have energy if you don't do it. Sleeping is good for your body, and you can deal with weight as you get further away from your quit date.      I don't remember any magic formula that made any of the crappy part of quitting go away. It sucks, and the only thing that actually makes it go away is time.       You've made a great decision to quit, it's ok to want to snap, freak out, and stamp your feet, but if you take a puff it all starts again.      This can be a great place to get support when everyone around you seems not to care.        Take a breath del and be at peace as best you can.      R
    Hi and welcome Del...   You had a good quit going ...   You have a train full of quitters here ,who will tell you YES...it does get easier...and the only way this happens is if .....  You Never Stick Anything In Your Mouth And Set Fire To It ....  This is the place to be for Support...we all understand and have been where you are ...my advice...Dust Down ...    Read all you can here...stay around ...post often ...Learn about this awful Addiction....   We have all Quit ...you are no different ,you can and will if you want it bad enough...
    Welcome del, I know how you feel. The first few months are the hardest but they are doable. I too had absolutely no energy. I found that sucking on candy really helped both the craves and the foggy head feeling. I also let my body dictate what it needed in order to try to repair all the damage done by smoking. So if it was hungry, I ate. Tired, I slept, etc.    Also when you get a bad crave you can come on here and post an SOS letting us know you need some extra support. We will come running to help you past it. I did a couple times and they worked  The last tool I used for a good six months was my air cigarette. I just pretended I was holding an actual cigarette then went through the motions of "smoking" it. It worked great at tricking my mind into thinking it was getting the real thing.
    Welcome to the train Del     You've had some great advice already. You now have to decide if you want to get this done or not because, it WILL take an unwavering commitment and follow through to be successful.    Those annoying craves will go away but you need to stick with your commitment not to smoke to make that happen. Knowledge about this addiction and how it works is another key component. Everything to do with that knowledge is available for you here. Read all you can here on the site and watch the Joel videos. All are informative. Knowing how this addiction works will improve your chances of success because you can then outsmart it rather than trying to just fight it. And support from others who are on the same journey as you are is surprisingly helpful. You'll get support here not just for a week or two but for your entire time here on the train. Support and a sharing of helpful information - you can't beat that       So now it's down to you - what will you choose? Continued addiction or a better life smoke free? Get rid of any cigs you have & let's get this done!
    Welcome aboard Del, good to have you along for the journey.  The craves stick around for a bit but after time it does get much better, the first month can be pretty hard then slowly you learn to fight the craves.  Read here and educate yourself, you will see that we hall have gone thru this.  Also come along and post and learn from everyone's experience -- it will help greatly and doing the NOPE pledge each day -- it really did help me.

del,Craves NEVER go away if you smoke, you live in a perpetual circle of craves.Every twenty minutes or so, nicotine levels plummet and create a crave.      .           When you quit, you free yourself from nicotine's  tyranny.Edited February 17 by Sazerac

I found that the people around me were largely disinterested in my quit.  Even my doctor (who had been telling me to quit) barely acknowledged it.      Don’t expect daily applause from casual friends and coworkers, especially as time goes by.  Find a family member or someone who has quit or is also trying to quit, they would provide that positive feedback for you.  This forum is full of successful quitters who will tell you how awesome you (and us) are for quitting and maintaining the quit, but you will still have to do the hard work yourself, no one can do it for you.     I mean, sure, non-smokers had encouraging words when I told them I was quitting, but they never circled back to ask how it was going.   Non smokers think quitting is as easy as it would be to stop toasting your bagel in the morning.  They have no idea the physiological and emotional roller coaster you’re on        Current smokers had encouraging words up front, but will tend to avoid you after, neither encouraging or discouraging.  I think it’s because they’re  envious that you a) had the courage to quit and b) of your continued success.  I’m ashamed to say that I was this was how I felt as a smoker when one of my smoking buddies quit.  I felt validated when they relapsed and started smoking again.     And sadly, some smokers will try to lure you back, because misery loves company.  Best avoid those people entirely.Edited February 17 by Wayne045
Mental Balloons Posted by gonfishn21 on 16 January 2015 - 06:17 PM  As I'm now chasing the tweenie label, and have been thinking a lot about the concerns I have had regading No Man's Land, its got me thinking again. As most of you know, that means I'm going to ramble.    Although I am not one that needs a lot of kudos, it seems that it is a necessary part of this process for a while.  We make it through day 1 HURRAH!!!!!!!!!!   We make it through hell week HURRAY!!!! Heck week over, " I feel better" HURRAy!!   Two weeks, wow, learning to get through the craves, HURRay! Three weeks, can be around my friends and family without committing a felony, HURray    Four weeks, nerves under control, waistband a little tight, not bad, HUrray Five weeks, walking, eating right, digestion shut down, but not smoking, Hurray Six weeks, no craves, no moods, no smoking, digestion shut down, HUH?   Seven to eight weeks, no one wants to know but you, how you are doing. By the way, my digestion is shut down!   They really stopped wanting to hear weeks ago, you just kept talking about it. You can see it in their eyes when you walk up. They probably have a pool about how long it will take you to bring it up. Or even worse, the day your digestion works!    Yeah, wow woot woot yippee, big deal.   Hello No Man's Land'    How am i going to keep going with this? I need to bring my own ballons to the party. I know my friends and family care, but they dont get it.   Even as firm as I have been since day one, this is one of the hardest things I have ever done. I know it, thats all that matters.   As i reach the little milestones ahead, I need to be the one who says HURRAY!!!!!.  I need to be the one who acknowledges the accomplishments. Afterall, in the end, I made the decision to quit, I made it through hell week, heck week, and i am the one who may never digest food again. I need to remind myself everyday, how much I have accomplished, BEFORE I have a chance to get weak. In that way, I can stay ahead, be ready to face any challenge with a strong defense.    Smoking is no longer an option for me. Smoking is just something I used to do. I control my actions, and smoking is a choice. I choose not to smoke, even if I never digest food again. I found a website the other day, that actually teaches you HOW TO SMOKE. I couldn't believe it. It takes you through lighting it, drawing on it, how it feels.......Holy Crap I was feeling it!!!!! Two flipping months into this, and I was feeling it, and then I knew. I had to make mental ballons and carry them with me at all times. Everyday is a celebration, everyday needs reminders, and everyday has its challenges. There is no one here, that can not do it. I'm not special. I'm just going to carry my own balloons.   Just sayin, Gon
You know Del, it's mighty brave of you to own up and mention you relapsed. It's pricking you inside somewhere and you want to get back on your quit, that's why you posted.     you've got the accountability part down to a tee, now for the execution part. Everyone of the stalwarts before me have given you amazing advice, and i'll only probably be repeating what they've said, but repetition helps commit things to memory so here goes...        A crave lasts 3-4 minutes, all you have to do is distract your mind for those 3-4 minutes by watching stuff, reading, getting up and making yourself a cup of joe, or tea or whatever you like. If you're at work then getting up, taking a small walk, talking to a co-worker...just force your brain to think about something else, and that crave will go.   It is highly possible another one will come up, but gradually you'll see these craves reducing in number...it may not look like it now, but it certainly does get easier.       I wish you the best of luck, please stay close to the forum, we love hearing success stories

It really doesnt get any simpler than that!       I whish you determination with your decision, there's absolutely no reason why you wouldn't be able to make it. Instead of idontknowhowmanytoxiccomponents, suck in all the information you can get, pick what works for you, vent, spoil yourself, scream, exercise, do yoga, stand on your head, take on a new hobby, talk to your support system about what you need.        Please let us know how you are doing, it will help us  in offering you much needed support.
    Hi Del, glad you're here because this is where you do really get the support that...i agree with you...is often lacking from friends and family who don't always understand. My son hated me smoking yet after I quit he barely mentioned it!  At the end of the day you do it for yourself, reading the celebrations here after each month of quitting were an enormous personal boost and learning about addiction was the biggest help of all. All the physical symptoms will ease off soon and you can worry about the extra bit of weight in a little while. Hope you get back on track with the quit and hope you stick around here 
Don't be a DumbAss. If they never went away ... why would we quit?  Of course they go away.     Sarge hasn't craved a cigarette in over 7 years.    ... but you can't get there if you keep doin' stupid sh*t, like smokin' ... right?  EZPZ
    I am still wondering how someone can go several weeks and not be able to find the strength to not light up. Sure there are tough times but does someone really think, "Just a couple won't hurt".

So it's like this. You either smoke or you don't smoke.     If you've committed to not smoking, you won't smoke. That's it. You'll deal with the cravings, the lack of energy, the mood swings and the frustration and everything else that goes along with it.     Sorry, but if you were committed, you wouldn't have smoked those two cigarettes. You need to get your sh*t together, get your head on straight and decide if you're going to smoke or not.      You are no more addicted to smoking than anyone else and it's no harder for you than it was for any of us. I struggled for 9 months. It sucked and sometimes I hated it, but I committed to not smoking, so I never did (and never will again). Who cares if no one is supporting you? You're not quitting for them. You're quitting for YOU! So what if you get fat. You'll lose the weight. This isn't a time for vanity.     You need to make a decision and stick with it. Either you smoke or you don't smoke. End of story.Edited February 19 by JimHannoonen
And to answer your question. No, the cravings will never go away if you smoke two cigarettes every 5 weeks.

Many millions of people have quit before you. Any discomfort you have experienced, many others have experienced the same thing. Do not think your experiences are unique.     Invest some time in yourself, your quit and your future, and start reading and watching videos about quitting smoking. You can start right here in QuitTrain, here:  https://www.quittrain.com/forum/15-joel-spitzers-quit-smoking-video-library/           Cristóbal    Edited February 23 by Cristóbal

Great video.  There's a lot of talk about the long-term benefits of quitting, but the positive effects of quitting begin immediately.  From there, the benefits increase exponentially.
It's amazing how quickly the body rebuilds. I think it's been about 3 years and 3 months for me now.  I can't even imagine being that ashamed little addict anymore.  And for 20 years I couldn't imagine being anything other than a smoker.  I thought I loved it.  Being a smoker was just embarrassing.  Truly the urge goes away 100%.It can and must be done.
Truly the urge goes away 100%.It can and must be done. It can and must be done.  Thank you,  Madame.

    Some ads, like for Salem, show people having fun hiking, skiing, snow sledding, out for a walk, etc.    Has anyone stopped to think, what if, what if what the ads were REALLY trying to say was, "This is the kind of fun you will have if you do use our product".        There was one where it shows two women and a man on a sled. They are laughing, full of energy, and just look to be having a blast. Smokers can't laugh or move fast without choking half to death.  I know in my case, when I could not even laugh at sick jokes without coughing, I knew it was time to quit.      But yeah, I think the ads showing anything sexy, fun, energetic, mysterious, whatever... maybe it was showing the life you could enjoy as a NON smoker.                 
    Always young, sexy people in those print ads.  Almost never a middle-aged or elderly person,  cause they would’ve looked like, well smokers who can’t walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded

At almost 6 months (i admit... this is also just an excuse to talk about these awesome upcoming 6 months...) my quit is carrying me, instead of the other way 'round. I cling to it like a lifesaver. Last week I had a few really tough days. The joy I experienced afterwards, after NOT lighting up, is so extremely satisfying and self-confidence boosting, daimn.     I can honestly say (and this is huge to grasp!!) the  'Ahhh, thank god I didn't light up!!! I am good at this and I am going to make it to the one year mark!!'  is 1000000x bigger than the 'Ahhhhh, my receptors are having a nicotine orgasm while I almost vomit and curse myself for giving in'.   Do your study, keep telling yourself how great you are for choosing life because you can't expect that from anyone else... and... trust the proces. And all will be fine in the end. Promise.
I lurked for 10 months after I quit and have a great affection for lurkers. There is a lot of scholarly information about nicotine addiction here   and our stories are a treasure trove of anecdotal evidence proving that anybody can quit.       The support provided here is another asset to a successful quit. Plus, we have some fun.        MLMR has one of the best documented quits.  Her journey has been a joy for all of us to witness.    So, believe her when she says, 'trust the process and all will be fine in the end'.  She doesn't lie.

    Just do it !!!.....what have you got to lose ....nothing .....  You have everything to gain.... You might surprise yourself .!!!!!.......so why not try ....    We are so proud of MLMR.....
    The weekend is upon us. GREAT time to quit. Put the smokes down and pamper yourself luxuriously.    You will never regret quitting, never ever.
    I floated different ideas to get people to quit before.     One was the smell- if they knew how bad the smell really was, I mean cat litter stink, they might smoke less and definitely hide it more.       New idea....teeth.  If they saw the yellow more...Saw the results...might embarrass them to smoke less and eventual quit.       We need a slogan.  Different ones for different areas.  Something like  "Smoke if you want British smile"       Or for booger- "kiss your cousin with that breath?"     Canadian version "smoking tar sticks to maple syrup after breakfast puffers"         The New Jersey could combine smell and teeth... Since they are know for both smell and smiles....      Southern....y'all tooth fairy can't afford you smoking....
    That's it? One like? Nobody offended? Nothing to say?  P!ace is getting boring
    There is hardly anyone here!  I'm getting ready for the big day and worry that I might be celebrating by myself.

    Moo ve over cat face.  Your speaking with a genuine super hero and brain washing is my special power.  Ask my three wives.          If I can get you to think it....it's real. And dental embarrassment is the new idea.  Insulting others is just the by product.  So if your from Kentucky and love both front teeth, don't smoke.   
    People putting disgusting things in their mouths is hardly new if there is a perceived benefit.     Also, I noticed you didn't say ex-wives... so... umm... you from Utah?                       
    A Trip to the British Dentist is never .......safe ....lol....

    Yeah if Bakon has been married three times and STILL found the willpower to quit smoking... then no one needs to tell him about strength.        
'If you're a smoker, quit now,' Albany lung cancer victim writes in his obituary    Associated Press |  Feb 20, 2019 | 11:55 AM Geoff Turner died from lung cancer due to smoking — but he didn't want others to suffer the same fight. (Sue Ogrocki / Associated Press)    ALBANY — An upstate man who recently died of lung cancer has a simple message in his obituary: “If you're a smoker — quit now.” The Times Union of Albany reports 66-year-old Geoff Turner wanted to warn others not to make his mistake in a self-written obituary published Saturday. The suburban Albany resident died Feb. 13, about three months after he was diagnosed with stage-four lung cancer.   Turner's daughter Sarah Huiest says he smoked most of his life. She says her father knew it was a bad habit, but he couldn't give it up.    Turner said in the obituary that he was “an idiot who made the same stupid decision, day after day.”    The obituary says to remember “life is good — don't let it go up in smoke.”      https://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny-metro-lung-cancer-victim-20190220-story.html           RIP, Geoff Turner
    Every time I read something like this, I wonder how much the person wishes he or she would have quit long ago when they got that nagging voice we have ALL heard in our minds saying, "This habit needs to stop."       Like, "Well, I will quit someday, but it is so hard!"   I wonder if it would be even harder to find out you have lung cancer.       For the other quitters here, I say really be thankful you found the strength to stop the habit before it stopped you.       One just HAS to tell the cigarette, "Good bye you -----ing G.D. worthless piece of life-ending ----.
The below is a repost of a repost of a repost... It is a post that I have found invaluable. I posted it somewhere else today - and LB suggested it have a thread of its own.... Triggers: Reminders From Your Executive Assistant Original post : Kattatonic Gold/ Freedom member. "It's all in your head" has developed a really bad rap in our culture. What's up with that? The power of the brain is remarkable. We should marvel and be impressed. Has anyone told you that since physical withdrawal is over... get a grip... or get over it... or something like that? What about patience with yourself? You've been informed that it's psychological after 2 weeks . Do you think the impulse to smoke should stop now, now, now? Do you think impulses after you have quit for a while indicate you are weak? Quite the contrary, actually. Your brain is working as designed. Okay, listen up. Your brain is amazing. Every time you do anything, one function your brain performs is to try to save you time and prevent you from repeating past mistakes. So quickly and subconsciously, your brain scans the memory banks for similar circumstances whenever you do anything. When it finds comparable history, it compares that with what you are doing now and alerts you to differences, just like an efficient little assistant. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yesterday I pulled on my day pack, went out the front door and turned left to walk up the street. Suddenly I am hit with a trigger. Why? Because I haven't turned left off my front stoop since before I quit. I quit in the winter and I have either gone out the back door to my car, or turned right to walk to the subway. Turning left means I am going to bother to walk to the grocery, which I haven't done since I quit. The part of my brain that tries to save me time, let's call him the Executive Assistant (the EA), recalled past left turns from the stoop. He went down a checklist. What did she need / what did she use on previous excursions like this? Wallet? Check. Keys? Check. Bags? Check. Smokes? NOPE. "Ah, ah, ah, excuse me!" I could imagine him running up behind me yesterday as I set out and picked up pace. "You've forgotten your cigarettes! You're going to need your cigarettes when you get to the café!" (I treat myself to a special coffee when I bother to walk to the market.) Remember all those times you forgot your cigarettes and kicked yourself? It was such an inconvenience when you were an active using addict. Back then, your reaction went something like this: "Memo to self. Don't forget the cigarettes!" What I'm calling the 'EA' function in your brain monitors these memos. He got the memos and he's acting on them. He got thousands of memos like that! The poor guy is just trying to do his job. So I thanked my EA for trying to save me frustration, reminded him that I no longer smoke and that he should refer to the new Never Take Another Puff memo. After my coffee up the street, I paused to listen to the Let's-Smoke trigger, a little different and a more uncomfortable than the Forgot-Your-Cigarettes trigger. There he was again, but this time trying to get me to actually smoke! What a guy! His reasoning? "You've eaten, walked and coffeed, you're about to shop... you are going to want a smoke before you know it and you'd always rather smoke here than while walking home. Always! Always!" This guy is no dummy. I did in fact send him that memo many, many times. For heavens sake, I smoked for 25 years. The filing cabinets are full of those old memos. How to teach an old dog new tricks? Well the EA in our brains can and does learn new routines all the time. We may learn slower as we age but we do still learn and adapt, especially if we do it consciously. We have to note new memos to ourselves, sometimes several times and we have to be kind to ourselves... or our ‘EAs’. The kinder and calmer you are, the more chance you have of him 'getting it' each time. So what to do in the café? I said to my EA, "Thanks! I appreciate the reminder but you have to look at the newer One = All memo again. I am not going to smoke today or ever. Please remember that coffee time is no longer smoke time." He will get it; I know he will. It will just take a while and a walk through all my various scenarios. He is really very, very good. He learned so well the first time -- I have to give him time to learn the new mandate. Thanks for reading my ramblings. You are doing it,! It is doable! It does get better and it is worth it... wait! Make that, YOU are worth it. Yes, you are.The factor that really shows the addiction is not how hard or how easy it is to quit. What really shows the addiction is how universally easy it is to go back. One puff and the quit can go out the window.UCanQuit
thank you El Bandito :-)
I really like this El B thank you!!
Good read :)
I love that post!  Thank you Bandit!!

Fantastic post El B thanks for sharing.
This one helped me so much!
This is a good one- it has been 13 days and I still feel like I am missing something when I am walking out the door.  Purse, phone,keys check.. cigarettes -  no I don't smoke.
This is a good one- it has been 13 days and I still feel like I am missing something when I am walking out the door.  Purse, phone,keys check.. cigarettes -  no I don't smoke.Yep. We spend years training our EA and then get frustrated when that training takes more than a couple of weeks to undo...
Hat to read this one again
This was a great read....
Bump for the newbies...Tremendous help to me in the beginning :)

I'm bumping this for the newbies,  and myself..   I got the Christmas decorations out to sort thru this morning and kept fighting the urge to go outside and smoke, then I realized, I haven't done this since I quit... I woke up my E.A. but now that I know thats what it was I can brush it off and get to untangling the lights.. (that I swear I had very neatly put away last year *humph*)

Love you too my favourite cross dresser!! Will read and read again, cheers muchly.

Bump for the newbies :)
I love this thread!
Bump for J :) x
Awesome read indeed!
What a fantastic post! Thank you for bumping it so I could see it! 
This post was invaluable to my quit.  Read it and read it again.
As we party tomorrow...don't let the EA take over....
Bumping for our newest members :)
time to bump this nugget :)
Bump for the March babies :)
My EA's being trained to go on Quit Train hunting for something to read...before I go out...to replacegetting ready to go out smoke time. Thanks, my EA liked this.
I would bloody that son of a bitch, if I could catch him.
This post always made it make sense to me. Bump. x
Nice bump QB. 
I adore this post. Thank you Marti for bumping it for me. There's not much more to say - it just makes total sense. And now I'll chuckle with cravings as I picture my EA frowning at my new schedule. 
At this juncture of my quit I am happy to have these thoughts in my head.             My EA seems to be referring to the new material most times.  :D    love it when all parts of me are in harmony.
Bumping this post because it had such a profiled felt on my outlook and it really resonated with me

The filing cabinets are full of those old memos.          How to teach an old dog new tricks? Well the EA in our brains can and does learn new routines all the time. We may learn slower as we age but we do still learn and adapt, especially if we do it consciously. We have to note new memos to ourselves, sometimes several times and we have to be kind to ourselves... or our ‘EAs’. The kinder and calmer you are, the more chance you have of him 'getting it' each time. So what to do in the café?           I said to my EA, "Thanks! I appreciate the reminder but you have to look at the newer One = All memo again. I am not going to smoke today or ever. Please remember that coffee time is no longer smoke time."           He will get it; I know he will. It will just take a while and a walk through all my various scenarios. He is really very, very good. He learned so well the first time -- I have to give him time to learn the new mandate.             Thanks for reading my ramblings. You are doing it,! It is doable! It does get better and it is worth it... wait! Make that, YOU are worth it. Yes, you are.The factor that really shows the addiction is not how hard or how easy it is to quit.

    This is an excellent read and comes at a time that I am noticing my brain reminding me of my routine! It isn't a crave, it is my mind doing what it has been trained to do.  So listen up  brain, I don't do that anymore!!!!!  
    Great post, great metaphor. Thank you! 
    I'd like to relate a little story about what happened to me a few years after my quit.      Was a hectic time in the office and had less then a half hour before the next blood-on-the-floor meeting was to take place so I ducked out, went down stairs and out the front of the building to the smoking area to have a smoke.  Got all the way to lobby on the first floor before I realize I'd forgotten my cigs.  Back upstairs and walking into my cubicle (ugh!) and reaching for my bag when the realization struck...I don't smoke.     Hi stress, fast paced, rush hour autopilot and I'm operating in a yester-year's mode without a conscious thought.  I'd triggered and hadn't even realized it.                
    What a brilliant way of looking at it. No personified nicotine devil at work, but just your EA doing its job.  
Very, very good video.   
Wow.   It's so scary how much damage smoking does, and what kind of hold it has over people.Freedom is 1000x better.Freedom is possible for all of us.
That is scary stuff!
Wow.I was strolling around the QTrain archives   looking for something that addressed how great the hold Nicotine Addiction can have on us  and chanced upon this. Mind Blowing. Please quit smoking. Please STAY Quit. Please. Love,S
This is a very good video.  It reminds me of someone I know.

It really has an iron grip. But its breakable!! With persistance and some love you can say goodbye to the cancer sticks for good, trust us.
     
    I remembered something the other day that I had forgotten for many years    (due to banishing second husband from my mind)  but,    back in the day, we were on an extended canoe trip in The Quetico   and had been towed out through MN's Boundary Waters.    We were planning on a few weeks.    Compass and Map. Spectacular wilderness, Duluth Packs packed with supplies. At the last minute we decided to forgo cigarettes and the flask of Cognac.      After two days, we went berserk from nicotine withdrawal.   We were ignorant about addiction, we just went nuts and furiously paddled back miles and miles and miles and miles.  We were insane.    It was a v. hard paddle for two more days but, we were driven.  By Addiction.   We finally reached The Boundary Waters and found a Lodge.  Bought smokes and got drunk.  We were so crazed. Nicotine does that.     I am so glad I quit.  Everything is better without Nicotine.  Everything    and as a caveat, camping is better with a flask of Cognac.  Snake bite and all that. LOL.

Nicotine does that...                                   Reminds me of the time that me and my father went on a two day canoeing/camping trip.  Dad had plenty of cigarettes but didn’t get the chance to smoke very many.  You see he had never been canoeing on a real river and he steered us right into a tree within five minutes of the start, overturning the canoe and the water ruined his open pack.   And so the day went.  Each time he opened a pack to have a smoke we would hit a rapid shortly after, turn over and have another wet, wasted pack.  Halfway through the day all 3 packs he had brought were ruined.   He bummed some from a buddy when we stopped for lunch and he put them in a ziplock bag to keep them dry.   But comically,  those were lost too, and soon he was offering $5 for a dry cigarette, $10 as the afternoon wore on.   We finally made it to the campground and he was able to smoke (and dry out).  I’ve got a great photo of him at the camp site sitting on a cooler, still wet, his head resting in his hands, looking exhausted     The 2nd day, he put his cigarettes into a plastic jug and tied it to the canoe so it wouldn’t get lost if we turned over.  When he had a moment to smoke, he would open the jug, take out one cigarette and carefully seal the jar back up before lighting up  We did pretty good the 2nd day and only turned over once on a very fast rapid near a short waterfall.  He still didn’t smoke very much though because floating down a river on a small narrow boat requires your constant attention and work     We never went on another canoe trip.  I always wondered if it was because he knew he wouldn’t be able to smoke as much or it was just too physically exhausting for him.  Still, for me, very fond memories, as well as two days worth of great stories, we weren’t the only amateur river rafters/canoers there             Edited February 20 by Wayne045
What a great story, @Wayne045 !     If addiction wasn't so deadly dangerous, it would be splendid comedy fodder.    What an idiot I was.     Edited February 20 by Sazerac
I haven't been around that much but I was here yesterday and was glad to see all of the long quits. I haven't written in a few years but would like to post a few thoughts about the quit process.      Looking at the new and young quits, and the never-ending fight to gain a foothold on the sticky quit, I just wanted to let the newer quits I see on the QT know, that you'll get there too, by sticking to your plan and what you will learn as you stay quit.      This is only a mind game, where your self control is being tested constantly. It wears on you as you overcome the triggering of craves through attrition, trying to process them simply as your mind/body healing itself naturally through recognition and reaction. That someting so elementary is so taxing is hard to understand sometimes.      It really requires no action other than acknowledgement of the particular craving and the processing of it.     Repetition is the key. The first triggers and craves that you will defeat are the ones you encounter the most. The most infrequent ones are the last to fall, and they do, through repetition.      If you will just keep doing your normal daily and nightly activities sans the nicotine delivery, eventually you'll roll over the addiction and leave it behind. Sounds overly simplistic reading this but remember that you will trigger and crave and try to understand what caused it. Don't be alarmed and dont make a hasty judgement, because sometimes you can't put your finger on the particular cause to your effect.      Could be romancing the cigarette subconsciously and missing that old smoky life, since things have changed and you don't know who you are sometimes. I mean you were this... smoker... and now maybe scared and are wanting to go back to what you see as normal. That is when you get tough and remember that you control your own mind and heart and that you call the shots. It's okay to feel weak, but know that you didn't get this way in a few days so it will take a few months of honest work to get out of the hole.     You will make it, even if you feel like you won't. This will not kill you but it will make you unbelievably strong if you'll just stick to your quit plan and your back up plan, and allow yourself some time to heal.      So be militant anti smoking, and  remember that you are in a fight and that you are unwinding your whole being from the addiction so walk like it and act like it.      Once smoking and cigarettes were every part of you, and now...well now they are not. That hurts and that is painful, but it is the work you have to do, so let the process work. Pay it forward, and stay as strong as you can as you use what you have learned.        And if you fall, it isn't the end. You start again. A dream becomes a wish, and that wish becomes your reality as you work the quit. Time is on your side now, so dont give that addiction any more of you. You're in control of your mind and body and you've taken the chains off. Don't put them back on.        KTQ,     Edited October 29, 2018 by MarkusTypos

    Brilliant as ever post....  Good to see you back on board ....
    Great read Markus, and yes you surely know your way around a quit, so thanks for the wonderful advice, and congratulations on a decade of sticking up for your health and well-being. Thanks for the inspiration as well.
    It is great to read your words again, Markus.   You were a profound influence on my quit and it is great to have the opportunity to express my gratitude    and see your positive effect on even more quitters.  
Hi Markus,      It is great to see you again, I remember you from QSMB.     This is a really good post, because it explains to the reader that nicotine addiction has no intelligence. It is primitive, and not the 10 meter tall monster so many people think it is.       We have intelligence, and we can learn.         Quote                                   Repetition is the key. The first triggers and craves that you will defeat are the ones you encounter the most. The most infrequent ones are the last to fall, and they do, through repetition.                                      If you will just keep doing your normal daily and nightly activities sans the nicotine delivery, eventually you'll roll over the addiction and leave it behind.                                 This is wonderful !!!           Cristóbal
Thanks all for paying it forward because thats really important to cement that quit.The years roll up under you. It only drags on for a short time. I actually forgot my quit date, I thought it was Feb 11 but I got it straight now and was reading Divers 5 year, apparently she missed it (Jen).    This only proves that quitting causes absent mindedness in some people. Seriously though we retrain ourselves as Cristobal just mentioned, and are always retraining until we address every single trigger. I love that ancient post from the qsmb, I think its called "My Personal Assistant". It really is an accurate depiction of the human brain processing life after quitting and how it keeps track of what you have addressed or not with regard to triggers.      You don't have to be strong, just learn to roll with it and it's yours. It's just a mind game.      KTQ

OK so first, my biggest trigger for wanting a smoke is excitement. Well like last night my room mate cooked up an awesome dinner with rice and chicken breast. After eating and feeling stuffed, I thought "Holy crap that was delicious! Time for a cigarette! Eh crap, I don't smoke and ain't got no tobacco anyways".   I do not get excited often but when i do, that is when I feel this weird "nudge" to want a smoke. But not enough to give in.    Maybe I found an awesome deal on ebay. Whatever.        But many people say stress is their big one. Well, no matter our age or whatever, stress is always about. Like at my boring job, sometimes I will be working and thinking of things that piss me off. Something that happened 30 years ago, something that I merely imagined, or whatever. So I will be basking in violent thoughts about people I cannot stand. Very stressful but never once during my hateful fantasies or memories do I think, "I want to smoke".       As we age, stress is more common in life than excitement. Unless you drive a Pontiac. OK stupid joke.   But yeah since life is mostly drudgery and stress, which trigger many smokers to light up, how does anyone manage to lay off?       Side note - my room mate drives a Pontiac. It has  a gas leak. So even if one of us did smoke we could not do it around the car cause it might explode. THAT would be hilarious.
    I used to be an equal opportunity smoker...loved me a good old woohoo smoke but chain smoked when stressed... How did I do it... by realising that having a smoke was not going to cure me, get me a new job, pay the bills, put food on the table, erase my past hurts, comfort me, answer any of my questions.....and have the boys and girls here to remind me of all that when I needed it.     Actually, learning that instead of helping with stress smoking would increase it and understanding the neurological connection between nicotine addiction and anxiety helped me learn to cope with stressful times without putting something iny mouth and burning it....I will confess when I get super stressed now I will reach for a chewy (non-nrt of course) or I'll suck a mint ... But for the most it is just life and the one thing I know for a fact that will not help any situation is a smoke.        It was also having threads like this to read in the early days that made me realise that it wouldn't help and why, so thanks @Jet Black for starting such a good thread.         
    I used to smoke for any reason...Happy ,Sad,Stressed ,Not stressed ...I just Smoked ...because I was a lady smoker who deserved a little treat no matter what was going on ...  I woke up and  smelt the coffee.....No you Idiot your a Addict who needs her fix ....   I now deal with life's up and downs much calmer ...I'm not wound up like a spring ..    Stress can be hard enough without nicotine withdrawal to boot ....  The longer the quit ..the more relaxed you become ....
One of the main tenets of nicotine addiction is the fact that smoking causes stress, much more stress and anxiety.   Here are some resourcesSmoking and Mental HealthExplaining The Stress Inducing Effects of Nicotine To Cigarette Smokersandfrom our friend, Joel             Quitting smoking has taught me how to educate myself about a problem, change my attitude and change my life.If I am encountering too much stress,  I see that as a choice and a challenge to mitigate it.   My life has far more excitement than stress and I am Sixty Three. It is all about one's frame of mind and the choices one makes.There is often the promise of a great adventure right around the cornerall of which makes for an interesting life, for sure.    Drudgery and stress ?Not for me, sugar,I had enough of that as an active nicotine addict !  Edited February 13 by Sazerac
    Stress doesn't trigger a crave.         Stress is just an excuse that you will latch onto.  EZPZ
    The cravings/triggers are starting to become just a dull roar now for me 'most of the time'. Now and again a 'moment' crave or a 'stress' trigger will still grab my attention a little more. I don't really understand why some of them will stand out or become something I have to 'fight off'.      Either way the tactics and strategies that I have used since I started my quit, get me though all the moments. Take a breath........address what is really going on "I want to smoke because I used to be addicted to smoking - now I don't smoke"..........distract myself from the moment 'grab a guitar and play a few licks'.       Peace       Rory
    Well friends, I have become one of them. One of what you ask? One of those folks about to rant about smokers :-)     I took a quick little trip down to the Dominican Republic where I got to take in some vitamin sea (see what I did there :-)). I walked a ton, and checked out as much of the local fare as I could. I was astonished that while eating supper there were people smoking at the tables all around me. While I was playing guitar a couple of nights at local bars, people were smoking two feet away from me. Imagine, while I was trying to entertain these wonderful folks, there was a grey haze three feet from the ceiling.     Everywhere I went, the beach, the bars, the pool, the ....... everywhere were people smoking three to five cigarettes an hour. It was overwhelming. Not in the way of "wow do I need a smoke', it was more like 'I'm dying a little every time I breathe.   For nearly a week after my little adventure, I felt that I was trying to soft cough up something in my lungs that I hadn't experienced in a long while.     I'm taking this as a hugely positive experience. I played (guitar and sang) at two bars while I was in the Dominican and I had a blast. I enjoyed the local people, the beaches and bars, and all the expats that I got to meet. I also didn't smoke. Not a single puff. Not only that, but I didn't obsess about smoking at any point. All the smokers around me, and all the smoking triggers and situations, yet it wasn't an issue for more than a fleeting moment.     My journey continues and I appreciate the friendship and support all you folks offer    Peace   Rory        
    Great news, Rory !  So glad you were able to enjoy yourself, even in a cloud of second hand poison. So glad you did not feel temptation.    Congratulations on your One Year and One Day of Freedom !
Thanks for the update Rory! It's great to hear about how rock solid that quit has become after 1 year off the smokes. It's even better that you can share that with others who are early in their quits or just thinking about quitting. It's too bad you had to endure the conditions you did in the clubs or bars you played at but good to know you now look at those situations in a completely different light than what you used to
    What a great update to your awesome smoke free life. Sucks there's so many smokers there still but what a testament to your commitment to be an ex smoker! Come to California next time. You won't have to worry about playing and singing in a smoky club

Risking to come across as a raging Newborn Quitter... but heck, what an amazing load of bs goes around about quitting! 'It takes multiple tries to quit and that's ok!, 'Nicotine calms you down!' (Yes!! When you inhale that shit, AFTER you once started! It's like... an addiction  duhhh!! Otherwise it does nothing for you!). You were born without it, ffs. This sentence, quote website NiQuitin -> 'Als je een regelmatige roker bent, is de kans groot dat het missen van je regelmatige shot nicotine leidt tot een sterk verlangen naar een sigaret.' Translates to, 'if you are regular smoker, there's a good chance that missing out on your regular shot of nicotine leads to a strong desire for a cigaret'. Wait, what..? Isn't that the whole fckn point? Seriously, who do they think they are adressing,  toddlers? This is what makes it an addiction! Besides,  'a good chance..' implicates there's room for doubt, for dreaming about being able to control the yearning. I did that for years and it made me totally hopeless.   It's crazy how much of this so called information gives a consistent message of how hard it is to quit, how understandable it is to fail, how it's basically ok to be a helpless victim, or even in the case of many vaping websites, to be proud to belong to this new generation of 'aware vapers'.... more enslaved than ever.   I remember earlier in my quit people said, be mad. Understand what's happening, how they do it, educate yourself and be angry! I think this is that. What you were talking about. It's crazy. I can't unsee it anymore. I don't need that shit in my body, I don't need it to poison my mind. The nicotine business, whether it's cigarettes, vaping, chewing, gum or you name it, that business is sick to it's core. There's people making zillions out of it and I walked straight in line...        Never, never ever again.     Edited February 9 by MLMR
    Love this M....Great Post !!!
    Why are you angry?  I thought we were supposed to be angry at tobacco companies so why you so angry at people that are just trying to help others quit?  It might sound like BS to you but if it's helping someone else quit then surely that's a good thing.       Millions of people quit smoking every day and they are doing it with that so called BS advice.      It's great that you're however many months quit but don't knock what makes help others.         Its all education - however it's put. 
I think you have missed the point, @Lilly.   There is a lot of misinformation out there with regards to quitting.One that incensed me was that cold turkey is too hard.  Here is an excerpt from my POST, June 13, 2016"I quit almost three years ago   and have become an advocate of Cold Turkeybut, believe me,I support and encourage everybody in their precious quits.    Any Quit Is A Good Quit  I thought to gather some new information(in a galaxy of  Misinformation)   and was dismayed after googling around  finding numerous instances of 'responsible experts' recommending to  NOT quit cold turkey.   What kind of idiotic advise is that ?  Is this more Big Tobacco poisoning minds ?  Big Drug companies pushing product ?    Ignorance ?Today, I found a great rap about this from our Friend, Joel Spitzer   Edited February 9 by Sazerac
    Right we know I used NRT... Pretty sure noone missed that memo but that said I agree with the girls and I totally get why mlmr is angry. Saz hit the nail on the thread.... The info out there on a lot of places you look is the cold turkey is too hard and doomed to fail...I call bullshit.... It most certainly isn't too hard...look how many ct quitters we have here...it certainly isn't doomed to fail look at how many ct quitters we have here who are years in.... I'm the first to arch up and defend NRT and NRT quitters if I needs be....but mlmr wasn't posting that NRT is bad or pointless she was bemoaning the hypocracy of the misinformation issued by NRT providers to ensure they get business...misinformation that is basically bald faced lies.... That's worth being angry over.
    I haven't missed her point everyone, I just don't agree with it. 
    The thing I read throughout your post MLMR is that mentally you have turned the corner on smoking. I have been reading that in your posts for the past little while and that's a great thing that you finally "get it"! Getting mad at the whole process that enslaved you for so long and everything to do with it is just fine and dandy in my books. Once you have that mindset, it will be almost impossible for you to relapse. That's the great news for you. How you got there matters not. Getting there is key. It's hard to get to this point without some very serious determination and a lot of self examination along the way. You've put in the work, now it's time to reap the rewards       
     @Lilly, so you think there's plenty of solid, trustworthy, sensible information available, to aid people in their quits? Since thát was my point and you say you don't agree with it.   @reciprocity, I am starting to get it yes, somehow the past few weeks have been speeding the proces up. Not only am I able to say 'nope' when life does strange and sometimes unexpected things, noping my way through makes everything better, or less sucky if you will. The craves and thoughts about smoking are NOTHING compared to the misery I'd definitely have about smoking through these same unexpected things. The stink, the shame, even keeping a distance from people because I was afraid I smelled. Imagine that, deliberately staying away. That is just sad.    @Sazerac and @notsmokinjo, jep!
    I just think it's naive to think that everything that is said is BS. It may well be to you and plenty of others BUT millions of people quit every day with the help of that so called BS.       People quit years before the internet and they still quit without it. A lot of people quit successfully who attend quit groups and they spout that BS on a weekly basis.        You may not like that BS but it works for some even if not for you. 
    Ah, so you DID miss my point. Ok, end of discussion as far as I'm concerned.

Adults younger than age 30 could be legally prohibited from buying cigarettes in less than a year's time -- and all cigarette sales would be banned in Hawaii in five years -- under a bill by State Representative Richard Creagan. The bill was co-signed by Representatives John Mizuno, also a Democrat, and Cynthia Thielen, a Republican. "We're taxing them, that did decrease use somewhat, but we still have 140,000 people in our state that smoke cigarettes. You don't see them as much anymore, because we kind of made them hide. But, they're going to die, half of them are going to die if they keep smoking, and we can prevent that."    Creagan dismisses the argument that his proposal would take away a smoker's civil liberty, saying it is something the tobacco industry has long cited. KHON2 was unable to reach the American Civil Liberties Union for comment on this story.  Creagan says smokers are horribly addicted and need freedom from enslavement.   Smokers and non-smokers have mixed feelings.    Kenny Tsai says, "I don't think it's a good idea. It's taking away our rights to choose. That's what I think."  Frank Raken says, "Even tho like it's 21, you have to be 21, there is still kind of places that you can actually get cigarettes or, you know, how they ask someone to buy for them. It's gonna be a good idea." Vickson Victor enjoys smoking and says, "It's my right. It's my life. So, it's my choice."  State Representative Richard Creagan is a retired emergency room physician, who believes that from his Capitol office, he can save more lives.  In addition to smokers' addiction, Creagan says the state also is addicted -- to 110-million dollars in annual, cigarette-tax revenue. While Creagan would prefer the ban be immediate and total, he realizes beneficiaries of those tax dollars, the UH Cancer Research Center and John A. Burns School of Medicine, can't go cold-turkey. That is why the ban would be unrolled in phases.    Creagan believes, if Hawaii becomes the first cigarette-free destination, visitors will flock here. "Our beaches will be free of cigarette butts, our parks, all of that. Kids won't be exposed. You won't have to worry about your baby or your dog chewing on a cigarette butt, I mean, we'll be the first state to be cigarette-free and i think that's really cool."    Hawaii was first to raise the legal smoking age to 21 and with the proposed ban, he believes the state should continue to be a beacon for the rest of the nation.            https://www.kron4.com/news/national/hawaii-could-be-first-in-us-to-ban-sale-of-cigarettes/1745301619
I have predicted this for some time, though I thought it would be a country rather than a US state.  The smoking = freedom argument has been one of the most effective and persuasive ones advanced by tobacco companies and their allies, and I am pleased to see a respected entity simply refuse to accept this absurd association.  ultimately, abolition is the solution, and this scaled approach is precisely the way to achieve it.         Christian99 17 Years Quit

    I don't think the solution is to make smokers into criminals.   You will just repeat the prohibition era. (US)      I would prefer that smoking just fade away on it's own through people quitting or not even starting.   It was well on it's way until the e-cig/vape thing came along.

(1) This is not The State's place - despite what folks think, this is a giant leap of overstepping bounds. Then again, The Sarge thinks same for banning of all drugs. Not government's place.  (B) Did no one learn a thing during Prohibition? Or the (still better - and relevant/current) spectacularly unsuccessful failure known as The War On Drugs?     (iii) Only Government can take something this bad and sell it as a GoodThing™   EZPZ
    Better ways to help people than to outlaw things. 
Creagan said taxes and other regulations have slowed down tobacco use, but have not stopped the problem.    "Basically, we essentially have a group who are heavily addicted — in my view enslaved by a ridiculously bad industry, which has enslaved them by designing a cigarette that is highly addictive, knowing that it highly lethal. And, it is," Creagan said. Creagan said he started smoking as a teenager and did so regularly during his medical residency. The state is obligated to "protect the public's health," he said.  "This is more lethal, more dangerous than any prescription drug, and it is more addicting," Creagan said. "In my view, you are taking people who are enslaved from a horrific addiction, and freeing people from horrific enslavement. We, as legislators, have a duty to do things to save people's lives. If we don't ban cigarettes, we are killing people.              Nobody likes to be told what to do and if they aren't asking for help leave them alone.         My views have changed after what i have seen, my mother was quit 9 years and the ending which was a result from smoking that started slowly over the years and boom. You can lead a horse to water ...      I was actually smoking watching the deterioration and like the addict i am i couldn't stop, if they were illegal i would've found a way to get them. Now after what i experienced i will do whatever it takes to never puff again. Ban em, educate them..  But help them        I remember back in HS a friend who could never be wrong about sports. I would remind him and this guy told me... Don't do that, give him this number.... You see the "type" that will make you money! Tell him he has a nice shirt while you're taking his $ that he willingly throws away ... I just looked at him and didn't understand it fully back thenEdited February 8 by Whispers

Those who argue that cigarette smoking is a form of freedom (or that smoking bans restrict freedom) are, unfortunately, arguing in favor of their victimization precisely in the way that the billions of tobacco marketing $$$ have hoped.  And the libertarian argument that the government shouldn't be involved in regulating/prohibiting substances is an interesting one; however, in order to use it in this case, you'd also need to allow, then, that things like methamphetamine and heroin should be decriminalized and readily available as well.  You're comfortable with that?        Commercial tobacco is a product unlike almost any other:  it is purposefully designed for maximum addictiveness, and normal use of it leads to death.  Hence, extraordinary remedies--e.g,, eliminating the product in a scaled way from the marketplace--are needed.       Christian99 17 Years Quit

Please ! Keep your hands off my narcotics, lol.     They are an integral part of my 'retirement' plan.  Opium in my 90's will be a welcome balm.        Choice is always where it's at.
    G’day   I’m not going to craft any arguments for the rights of trade, or peer speach or the rights of the individual.   Banning cigs is being talked about cause it’s very possible and doable. And that’s in my lifetime.  I think it’s blooming fantastic!    Im now thinking could this be tried in a slightly larger island....Australia of course! Instead of picking off the smokers one by one lets get big and pick off country by country.     Get big I say.  Let’s not muck about talking about it let’s make it happen. (And in my lifetime too!)   C
    I don't think anyone should be banning cigarettes anywhere.         What did make me laugh the most about this is that cigars, chewing tobacco and .....wait for it....e-cigarettes won't be banned. The reason e-cigarettes won't be banned is because they are less harmful than cigarettes. Make your mind up America!!
                All Hawaii is doing is categorizing Cigarettes as a drug..      People will still find a way to smoke if they want to smoke

Gday    I don’t know about banned... easy word to shoot off.    I do know that tabocco is no longer grown in Australia, no longer lisenced. Not banned. There were lisences, it was in the interest of big tabacco companies to controll things. Now no licences are issued to grow in the country so nicotine produces are imported.   It is illegal to sell snuff chewing tobacco and vaping nicotine. That’s sell. Not import for your private consumption. So no “rights” apart from those of big tabacco are taken away.   Meanwhile the big tabacco still have the right to import in cigs and tobacco and cigars. Regulated and taxed heaps. Smoking has declined from over 50 per cent to under 15 per cent. I’m betting the next figures will be under 12 per cent here hoping for that magic 10 per cent.     In my lifetime too. So it’s pretty exciting to think it’s actually possible to stop the wholesale sale of smoking in the country.   ChrisEdited February 8 by CbdaveSpeeling

I used to work some gas station. Occasionally, this guy came in who drove some Subaru with a loud stinky exhaust leak, he toted around an oxygen tank, AND he smoked non-filter cigarettes. One time I said, "you know, this is not a good combination" and he said something about how he was a sick man.  How does someone survive for more than a week like that?        On a different note, we also had this one lady come in who was professional looking like the boss at an office job, her legs were one mile long. No, really, they were 5,280 feet long. Holy **** just the sight made me want to smoke.. anyways I thought, "OK, this woman is TOO hot to be smoking cigarettes". One of those you just wouldn't expect to be a smoker. I thought that of myself when psyching up to quit. Like look in the mirror and think "Bitch you are TOO hot to be inhaling whatever is in cigarettes."      But yeah, who the hell carries oxygen around and still smokes? /even if the CANNOT quit, couldn't they just switch to chewing tobacco and maybe not create a fire hazard?
    My mum tried to smoke with oxygen. It shows how much of a grip this addiction has. Even when you know you're dying you still want to smoke 
Ten and a half years ago, my 42 year old brother died of lung cancer.  He smoked until he lost consciousness for the final time--and even then, for some time after, he continued making unconscious smoking gestures.  His inability to quit after his diagnosis and through his treatment was a source of profound pain and shame for him, making his impending and actual death even more difficult and frightening for him.  His wife took her own life a few hours after he died, underscoring and adding to the tragedy.      Smoking kills.      I quit for a better life; just as (and perhaps more) importantly, I quit for a better death.        Christian99 17+ Years Quit
Thank you so much for sharing that @Christian99 .. I know you have shared it before, but every time I read it is like a bucket of cold water to the face and the reminder I need to protect my quit come what may. I know I am not the only person who reads this and says "That wont be me" and by sharing your tragedy all around the world your brother & his wives lives and deaths are being given new worth. Thank you again for sharing such a hard memory to carry.
Thank you for sharing @Christian99....I'm so sorry for your losses....  I too lost my dear friend last year ....taking her last cigarette hours before she passed away ...it was sad to watch ...and sad because she thought she couldn't quit ...  I am thankful every day I found the strength to fight this Demon ....   Reading your post was a good reminder to Never Take Another Puff ....
Choice is our freedom.  We choose everyday for so many things,How do you want your coffee,what are you going to wear, what's to eat ? Little did I realize that for 40 some odd smoking years, I choose slavery.You couldn't have told me...it was my choice and I didn't even consider slavery or addiction.  Smoking was just who I was.I didn't care what y'all said or thought about me. Looking back now, I was a perfect Slave.  An excellent addict. You could show me all the scary movies...tell me all the truth about Big Tobacco,I didn't give a hoot.I had enough money to buy another pack of smokes at the corner storeand I made sure I was Never without.  Ever. I probably still have a carton up in my attic with a fire ax, in case of another Katrina. No, that's not true.I was just up in my attic today,  checking on things.There are medical emergency supplies and a fire ax. There are NO cigarettes. You know why ?I threw them out when I had no further use for them,when I stopped being a Slave. Choice... choose well.You have a beautiful Life to consider.
    More and more, I appreciate Freedom from nicotine.  Nicotine and the chemicals in cigarettes was far more invasive than I ever dreamed.     The empowerment, the commitment to personal truth has also been cathartic and transforming. I am a much kinder and trusting person to myself.  I have genuine compassion.   I don't deny the truth out of hand because I am an addict anymore   and this has led to a metamorphosis in how I greet the world.       Frankly, quitting smoking was the best decision I ever made in my life, bar none.
    Yes Saz, your compassion  and kindness for my "dilemma" throughout the past couple of weeks were a bright light in the darkness I was experiencing.         You can speak a hard truth for one who is on the cusp of hearing, yet speak that hard truth with kindness and compassion.        
    Very well put, Saz. You perfectly described what I was experiencing too: conviction that I smoke because I enjoy it and can stop any moment, and it’s harmful, yes, but I can stop so it doesn’t concern me. I can’t believe how blind I was. 
    Well put and I ask myself every day “ what was I soo damn scared of?!?” It was not as painful as I thought 
    I quit and failed so many times that I became convinced that I was also a hopeless addict who would forever be a smoker. Thank goodness to be free of that kind of slavery. At first it was just noping my way through each day, or sometimes it was moment by moment at thebeginning. quitting is tough but it is not impossibly difficult. I'm on some lung cancer message boards and sometimes read stories about patients smoking until their literal last breath when they simply could hold a cig or inhale anymore. At least I won't go out a smoker.
    freedom is delicious
Was up and about last night, suddenly remembering the endless conversations with myself...      Id forgot how I would be terribly awake at night , debating whether I would smoke outside or maybe in the kitchen. I forgot how I lay awake and then almost always ended up smoking inside the house, regretting the smell immediately. I forgot how often I thought, you know what, let's finish that bottle of wine now im at it. And ofcourse that meant another two cigarettes. I didn't want ashtray smell the next morning so I used the sink. Then id go back to bed, racing heart, foul stinky breath and smoke smell under the blankets, short of breath, coughing. Oh, so ready for sleep! Which often didn't come anyway.. so... I went out of bed again... *repeat*     Junkie thinking is popping up like crazy these days. Nothing I can't handle, but pretty annoying nonetheless. Forcing myself to think back at all the things I hated about smoking really helps.        What are some of the nuisances you forgot about...?  Edited February 7 by MLMR
    Emptying ashtrays.  I probably had five ashtrays in the house, one in the garage, and one on the deck.  It seems as if I was always emptying them.  I know I started a fire in the trashcan at least once.  Now I find other things to do.          The junkie thinking will leave you soon MLMR, come back and tell us about it when it does.
Running out of smokes, stores closed.   Frantically tearing through jackets, bags, purses, drawers, the trash for a smoke.  One night,  after hunting under and behind all the furniture,  I moved the refrigerator.    Look !  A snipe !   A disgusting snipe. Yellow with stains, so poisonous even the stray mouse wouldn't eat it.  I smoked it and felt much better.   Gah.    I smoked a lot of dog ends in my day.    Edited February 7 by Sazerac
The whole damn process! And, it was a daily process. Each and every day, 365 days a year.       Getting dressed 1st thing each morning and getting outside to have that precious 1st smoke of the day. That 1st smoke was like my anti-nope. It was a confirmation to myself that I was still a happy and compliant nicotine addict.That 1st one started the whole daily process all over again each day.       I no longer plan each day's activities around making sure there's a time and place to smoke. I no longer try to limit or avoid life's activities where I can't smoke for a long period of time. There's so many more things that I used to think about that don't even cross my mind any longer. So nice to be in charge of my life again instead of enslaved by an addiction. Of course, we don't see it that way as smokers - true junkie thinking!
    Always worried I would run out ....my whole day was planned by cigarettes...asking myself the junkie questions ..   Have I got enough to see me  through until I go out tomorrow...if not ....cutting down to make sure I have ...and spending time craving and willing the time to pass so  I could have my next precious smoke .. Do I miss that ....Not a chance ...

    Smoking in the rain.    Cleaning wet ashtrays.  Having to pause every movie at least twice so I could go outside and get my fix.    Panicking when discovering I didn't have enough cigs to get me through the next morning. (I live in the country, so a quick trip to the store late at night is out of the question.)    Packing my purse full of gum, perfume, and hand lotion all to try to hide the smell.    Restless legs (nicotine withdrawal exacerbates Restless Legs Syndrome.) Never fully enjoying a visit with a friend or loved one, bbecause I was always anxious to leave and go smoke.   Coughing. All the time.     Sooooooo many nuisances!

Man I just barely survived yesyerday, the craving was almost fatal feeling.  Heavy chest, panic feeling, glom and dome !    Seems come April 5th I will be in the company of the unemployeed in California, turning 60 This month it really sent me spirolling out of control.  Yesterday after waking up and finding out it was not a bad dream the stress started to build.   Up dating my resume, filling out Apps,  searching and the gloom continued to build, the want and NEED for a smoke was growwing. It got so bad at one point I remembered where a 10 dollar cigar was !  All sealed in its glass Tube as fresh as the day it was rolled.  Baby, BABy ! I called and my wife came into the room,  There is a cigar on My rifle rack go get it crush it and toss it in the Garbage Please,  and without a word she complied.  Thank you LORD Thank you. Well it was not all bad news yesterday, I received a call about one of the Apps I filled out, a Interview ! YES !  Thats what I needed, I need to be reafirmed that I was still a marketable Item, That My Trade skills, knowledge and training were still a vital asset.   So the first Interview is set for Tuesday 10am,  now the research starts.

    Hi Peter, love this post..
    Great post, Peter.

I know quitting smoking is far easier than living with perpetual slavery, slow suicide or gruesome deathbut, quitting actually IS pretty easy.Sure, it took me about a year to navigate my way through de-tox, craves, and triggersbut, that is short time considering the 40 something years I spent establishing my addiction.The body heals so quickly, the mind shifts to a new consciousness.   I'm not saying it was a cakewalk into town,it took determination and focus,  sometimes it took ALL I had but, it wasn't THAT hard.  I  beat every damn crave.It didn't hurt and the rewards came fast and furious.  I am not making light of the struggle although retrospect is forgiving and kind.Still, even while in the thick of it, I knew it was temporary.I knew I was going to succeed.  I never gave myself an opportunity to fail.
Vaping is dangerous not only on the long term, but immediately.https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/02/05/vape-pen-kills-man-after-exploding-his-mouth/?utm_term=.9d3bc18ed0a3
That guy doesn't even look like he needed any more chemicals of any kind.       Also, even if vaping is supposedly not as harmful as cigarettes, at least cigarettes do not randomly explode. if the cherry drops off you can at least put it out before it starts a real fire.Edited February 6 by Jet Black
G’day   I’m cbdave and more often that not I get to raise the NOPE pledge of a morning. Being close to the international date line and living on the east coast of Australia means that I get to see the new day a lot earlier than most.   If I’m off fishing it can be really early as I hate my phone smelling of fish bait. It wasn’t always that way. I never posted a NOPE on the QSMB board in those first months. I thought it was a tad daggy. Couldn’t see the sense in it, if I smoked it was my fault it wasn’t needed to keep me honest.   Had a bit of a rethink about the three month mark as I had two quit killers coming up.  First a wedding with old friends who smoked and drinks... normally a recipes for smoking if every there was.    On my return a biopsy for cancer. Sobering. So I started to post to keep myself in touch with the board and more importantly as an acknowledgement that Yes I was really an Addict. It really hit home that I needed to fess I that I was only a puff away from going back to that standard 20 cigs a day!   So that’s me, now a diferent board ....but still taking the time to acknowledge the addict in me.... if only once a day.   So pledge or don’t pledge but never forget what it stands for   Not One Puff Ever   ChrisEdited February 4 by Cbdave
    I was more religious about pledging daily the first year or so because it just helped me focus for a moment on what the most important thing was that I had to do, or not do in this case. It worked for me.
I lurked for the first 10 months of my quit but, committed to NOPE. It was a big part of tearing down my denial and admitting I was an addict.  I would holler, NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE ! and FREE YOUR HEAD ! over and over and over.     When I joined, I jumped right in with the NOPE  and have only taken a few hiatus' from it.  There is a bonding, a feeling of camaraderie with everybody,  also often great eye candy optics !   Throwing the 'likes' around is a nice heads up, 'I'm glad you quit' hit of support for quits of any duration.       I love seeing 'tomorrow'  today what with the time differential, @Cbdave    It is always good to know that 'tomorrow' arrived intact    and brings this song to mind,    Edited February 4 by Sazerac
I am a junky... and a superstitious one at that...I seem to bounce from one addiction to another... so when I first joined QSMB I did not nope... ever.... there was no way I could pledge NOPE... not one puff ever... I mean I wasn't sure if I was going to last another day let alone forever.... how could I pledge I would take not one puff ever... I think I typed a nope for about 3 weeks before I actually posted one.. and then someone said... I pledge NOPE for today... and I thought, hey I can do that... I can make that pledge... and pretty quick I needed to make that pledge, and I needed to like everyones NOPE ... to acknowledge their pledge had been seen, to let them know they weren't alone... and then my NOPES got bigger and more elaborate and it became so I had to nope that way... It had to be a statement... or it was bad luck, or I would have a tough quit day... and then I became obsessed with it and then some people expressed the fact they didn't like my NOPEs and I became paranoid and the hour it took to prepare them became an hour and a half or two hours because I would panic something I wanted to type would be taken the wrong way or be construed as racism or a million other things it wasn't and offend someone ... it became my new addiction something I had to do or my skin crawled but something that was damaging me to do so I had to break that habit... so now I Nope occasionally... because when it got to the point I was spending an hour a day researching a preparing a NOPE and getting anxiety if I couldn't get it just right I needed to step back. I still say each morning... NOPE I will not smoke today... and finish each day with NOPE, today I did not smoke... I just can't "NOPE" every day because I have issues.Edited February 4 by notsmokinjo
My NOPE was very important to me .....early in my quit ...I knew if I pledged a promise to myself and the board ,I wouldn't smoke that day ...  As time went on ...I was so proud  I rid myself of this terrible addiction after smoking over 5 decades.. I was proud to say NOPE.....  Being part of a group...a team....meant alot to me .... I still pledge now and again ...    I love watching the fun folks get out of it ....ya ...NOPING is powerful....a great tool to have ....
    I love your NOPE's, @notsmokinjo    It is amazing to me how much work you put into them and I appreciate the content and the time spent.    NOPE-ly yours,  S

NOPE-ly yours,          I also like your Nopes.  I think you are a walking encyclopedia!  You really get that brain stimulated and come up with things I would have never thought of.       As far as my Nope, it is very important to me.  It is the last thing I do at night and the first thing I check in the morning so I can "like" all the other nopes.  It kind of feels like my group hug. All those successful quitters standing by me and letting me know they are right there with me.
    G’day   Well I think I got the answers  that I was expecting..... varied. Seems we are all a bit diferent on what NOPE means to us. As long as we all get the thing we all want.... freedom from the smokes...  C
Man what a weekend, Rain major trigger, Driving a major Trigger, Rain and Driving for 1.5 to 2 hours Mega trigger and Then the Trigger of all triggers !Rain and the Superbowl !By the time I had got thru with the Rain and driving I pretty much had a handle on those triggers, Deep brethes to help the heavyness in my lungs stayed in the Fast lane for the want to just jump off and pick up a pack.By the time the Rain and the Superbowl Got here I was petty much prepped for the cravings,  had some project work to Do during the Breaks and Half time, the Wife was there and My Mom was there, and Both do not want to see me smoking again.I can seriously say if you have a hidden pack or even just a smoke get rid of it Now !  what save me and my Quit was the fact I can not smoke what I dont have.These were Major Craves and Triggers,  I was alone, the rain, foggy windows and traffic just eurged me on, flashes of me taking a deep drag and the satisfaction it brought,  This was a serious attack on my Quit, a attack that lasted all weekend On and Off.Thursday and Friday I would have told you I have this down, I am in tottal control, the days of having to worry about this Cravings and triggers were over,Today Monday I tell you I was wrong,  Was I in danger of lossing my Quit, No I don't think so, I still have my Gaurds and Protections in Place, I have not relaxed or dropped any of them.With every Battle such as this weekend that I overcome I grow stronger and the aditions grows weaker, it really used a enormous amount of energy on this one. In fact we both did. the knowledge that I had all you at a buttons notice to come run in and suppot me,  provided me that extra biit of confidence I needed, I still had Ammo, lots of Ammo at my beconed call,  This adiction was not going to win.
    Congratulations on surviving the weekend and keeping your successful quit, Opah !       You must be prepared for a full year of triggers.   Some are seasonal, some come from out of nowhere.   We have a lot of brain receptors to wrench away from the addiction.     While most of these triggers will not be as intense as they are now, while your quit is young,  still some may come out of the blue and really knock you about. All you can do is NOPE your way and watch them fade away.       Please reward yourself for your successful weekend, make a conscious point about this hard won bonus.
    Good job on getting past that brutal weekend opah 
    Way to go O !!!!    Every battle you win...is a step nearer to winning the war !!!!
Kong Hei Fatt Choy.... Happy New Year and blessing for wealth and prosperity.       So you missed joining the Quit Train at new years?.... not let that stop you, it is now Chinese New Year... it is tradition to sweep you house, pushing everything out the door, it is done to sweep the old year out and welcome the new year in. So why not metaphorically sweep out your body, get rid of the smokes and nicotine and welcome the new year as a non-smoker.      Apples and Oranges are eaten during Chinese New Year because their colours bring joy and good luck... but why not stock up as oranges and apples (or even just their juice) will help keep you hydrated and also help to keep your blood sugars up. So clearly this is the perfect time of year to quit.        Also this is the YEAR OF THE PIG (even though our Pig is awol  )..... years of the pig are know to be times of good luck and good fortune... clearly the year of the pig is telling you to give up and make your own luck and your own fortune (all that money you wont be wasting on tobacco)..        So start the Year of the Pig well.... give up and be lucky, and be fortunate.    Edited February 2 by notsmokinjo

    It's about time!!
Had the coolest thing happen last night. I had another smoking dream, but this one went very differently...     Usually in my smoking dreams I'm enjoying the heck out of that cigarette, and I wake up feeling simultaneously very guilty and immensely relieved that I didn't actually smoke. Well, in last night's dream, I was excitedly anticipating that first puff, ready to light up, when I suddenly blurted out the word "NOPE!" I have literally never done that in a smoking dream, not even in the 11 years I was quit before. I just said "NOPE," and bam! I woke up.     I guess my mindset has really changed! That or this place (and the daily pledge) is starting to infiltrate my dreams.       Either way... totally winning!
    Yay abby! That's awesome, looks like your mindset has indeed changed  
    this is excellent news, Abby.   As we sleep, the cilia in our lungs is busy scrubbing itself of tars and nicotine.  This can stimulate our sense of taste and smell and trigger dreams. You have quit smoking !  Looks like your subconscious got the memo ! 
Our lives are often a reflection of the choices we have made along the way. I chose to smoke for decades, to the detriment of my health and wealth. Two years ago I chose to quit smoking mostly to stop the harmful effects of smoking on my health.       Just recently I took the money I saved from not having to buy cigarettes for just this past year and spent that on a Caribbean Cruise and enriched my life by visiting 5 places I had never been to. This was a consequence I got to choose because I had quit smoking. You may choose something different. Doesn't matter. The point is YOU get to choose the consequence - not your addiction!    Didn't hurt that I escaped the bitter cold for a while either. Here's a couple of pics of my trip:          Lounging on the Lido Deck       At the beach in Tobago          Had I chose to continue smoking 2 years ago the best consequence of that choice would have been standing outside in the freezing cold getting my hourly fix.        The worst consequence of that choice might have been this?      Put the choices for your future back in your hands. Choose to quit for good! There are so many benefits from choosing to quit. Temporary discomfort in the beginning is a small price to pay to get back your freedom!
Fantastic!  I smoked my last cigarette 10:30 PM January 5, 2018. I smoked for 37 years. I remember it like it was yesterday. It wasn’t even my brand LOL.  It was one I bummed from my wife because I intentionally left mine at home.  I chose to quit for more reasons than one. Money was one of them. You’re right, a few days of discomfort is well worth the reward.  I chose to purchase some new home entertainment equipment with the money I’ve saved from quitting.  Quitting nicotine is by far, hands-down the most significant thing I’ve ever done for myself in this life.  Cigarettes did nothing for me. They took away my time, my money and my health.
    Fabulous .....  What a Reward for all your hard work ....Quitting is like giving your self a huge pay rise .... It looks Amazing .....
I'm starting to see the weakness of the smoker or the addiction. I had several people that are with the company buying us out come to our facility today. One of the guys asked where the smoking areas were. I told him and he wanted to know if I wanted to join him. Maybe I just look like a smoker...I don't know, but I told  him I was almost 3 months quit. He started to tell me that I had to miss it! I said no...not at this time that I was ready to quit when I did. No way...his wife was trying and was having a terrible time. I told him it was easy...I did it a 1000 times before!!         The whole thing is,  he kept trying to get me to go out and join him. He couldn't take no for an answer. That is BS! I don't want to smoke and he was trying as hard as he could to get me to go out with him. What does it take to be able to just say no? Didn't do it and proud of it. But why push us? To make themselves feel better?      It's hard enough for the most part without being goaded...makes me want to say go  piss up rope! Sorry just saying!!
That's just dumb. I had several occasions in the last 5 months where smokers thought it'd be justifiable for me to smoke one... as if that's their decision anyway. Strange how people want to comfort you with their own crutch. So glad I didn't, by the way.     I remember always feeling a little jealous when a fellow smoker gave up. And... yes, I also was reluctant to believe they could do it. I think mainly to feel a little les shitty about myself. I'm ashamed about it, but I think it's just what addiction does to you.
    Feel sorry for the poor smoker W....    He's still believing all the lies ....he wanted you to go with him....cos he woudnt look such a sap being by himself ...    High five to you ....deep down that smoker  was so envious of you ....this is why he went to great lengths ....

    What a great charge for you to be able to say, 'NO'  and mean it !  Good for YOU !
    Good on you for standing your ground wantsit. Smokers hate losing one of their own, it makes them realize that this addiction isn't impossible to overcome. I'm happy for you

    Unfortunately this is pretty common.  I suppose a group of people making bad choices is easier for us to justify than a single person.  Not that addicts need help with justification!  We are experts!
    I have heard a couple times in the past, "You don't do anything do you?" cause i don't smoke, drink, or use drugs.  It is like, "How old are we?"

    Almost half my life I have spent smoking, sucking and Puffing an polluting my Body, kinda like being in prison I would Think ?
    We were in prison. We weren’t sure of it, but we were on death row. We had seen others killed. The rules requiring a swift and humane execution were not guaranteed. In fact, the torture of slow poison was in motion. What bugged us most was not the prison or even the death sentence, but that the punishment seemed way out of proportion to our crime. It was unfair.    There had been rumors of escape, but even so, our cells were solid brick. They happened somewhere else. We had run at the walls before to no avail. If we escaped, surely we would be recaptured and our imprisonment would be made even more severe. We were comfortable in our cells. It was our choice.  We heard a whisper. It was so soft we could barely hear it. “If you say NOPE and laugh in Spanish like this, jajajajaja, you can walk right through the wall to freedom for ever.” That’s crazy, feel how thick and hard these walls are – there is no way we could walk through them. We’re not strong enough. What’s on the other side anyway? Tomorrow, maybe.   Finally we tried it, and it worked! We ESCAPED! The wall wasn’t solid, it was made of smoke. We passed right through it. We were free. Now we help others when they escape and are blinded by sunshine and overwhelmed by fresh air. And we whisper to those still in prison, “If you say NOPE and laugh in Spanish like this, jajajajaja, you can walk right through the wall to freedom for ever.”

Man 21 days, 3 weeks and headed on to one month,  Man I am so glad I did not take a could of years to get smat and get back off of the Nicotine.    This time with the edjucation, experiance and knowledge I am doing really well,  Knowing what will  I was basically going to go through and being able to perp for it was such a benefit.   I have decided that this time I will not enter No mans Land, insted I will circumvent it, yes that is correct I am going to Navigate myself around No Mans Land.    Yes Yes that will be the Trick, avoid it, Do not allow myself to enter.   I have the tools and Mode of transpertation to accomplish this.  Yes Yes I feel empowered.Edited February 1 by Opah
    Congrats! First month is within reach now, must feel good.      I still count in weeks, it helps me divide the months and therefor every day/week/month is of equal importance and worth mentioning to myself. Building a rock solid quit by doing so.      I think No Mans Land is as true as you make it, so denying yourself entrance seems like a good thing to do   
    I didn't experience No Man's Land.  When the initial 'shine' of my quit wore off    it was replaced by a bigger and  brighter shine of accumulated time.    I was SO happy I had quit and still, five years later, have a deep, confident grin about it.        I was stopped on the street the other day.  'gotta cigarette ?' 'No', I BEAMED. 'I Quit !'  'Congratulations'.  He couldn't help but notice my exuberance, I was a-glow.
    The quite when all fades and life just goes on is what got me last time, it was said and done, felt I was in control and then that one cigar.   then two weks later, hell that was no problem then once a week for no reason at all but to smoke,  I was screwed from that point.   So this time there is not going to be quite, I will make my own noise,  The echos of Opan will rebound off of these walls far and long. When my war is over and it is a scurmish here and there, I will be supporting other quiters in their plight and fight to be nicotine free.  I figure to become a fixture here and in doing so never have to set foot in the quite of the Mans land.  
    Addiction is forever and re-ignited so freakishly easily.   I was almost a year into my quit when that really sunk inLifetime of Addiction
    Ya I had a really hard time excepting  that, in fact I fought hard to keep that avenue open.  
I never entered No Man's Land Either....I was so grateful to be rid of that 52 year addiction...it's about positive attitude....    Keep positive ....don't  allow negative thoughts.........

Though it has been in my thoughts overwhelmingly, for the past week, I am not smoking.  I have been able to wrap my brain around the fact that this is just a test of my resolve.   My parents are both sick now.  My mom became sick at the beginning of the week and I have been running between her home and the rehab to take care of both.  My dad seems to have given up and was diagnosed with pneumonia.  He has quit eating and I have been trying to make some of his favorites and take it into him but it hasn't helped.                                                                                                       I had been trying to get my mom into the doctor but she would refuse.  I finally took her to the emergency room yesterday and they admitted her.  She is very weak and has RSV and they are concerned about her getting treatments for her lungs.  Sitting in the emergency room, my mother said every cruel thing she could say.  When they decided to admit her, she informed me she would never forgive me.  The doctors encouraged me to leave her because she is very weak and her lungs are full of fluid.  She called last night and said she expected me there this morning because she is signing herself out.  I am up and dressed and ready to go.    You know, I was a great kid.  If I knew my parents would be so difficult in elderly years, I might have given them a little more trouble when I was younger. lol.   I am trying to separate the childhood hurts and realize that their responses are coming out of fear.    I am just venting to keep myself sane.  I know there is nothing you can do to change the circumstance but you are my encouragement for success in quitting.  You all always give me the words to keep me steady on this journey.     Edited January 24 by Linda Thomas
    Hi Linda        Well done for keeping your resolve.     Like quitting Tough love isn't easy but it has to be done.      Stay strong and Tuff.
    Bless you Linda, you can't help how your parents are, they are certainly very lucky to have a daughter like you, who still runs around for them, even though many would,nt. ((hugs) )Stay strong
    I'm really sorry to hear that now your mom is sick too Linda. I'm glad you have us and this board to vent to. Quitting is so hard with no extenuating circumstances and you've proved time and time again just how strong you are. No you will not smoke. You will not give anyone or anything a reason to break your quit. You are my hero and proof that anyone can quit and keep their quit no matter what is thrown at them.    You are in my thoughts and no matter the outcome you will have peace of mind that you did all you could do for your parents in spite of how badly they treated you...xoxo
    Dear friend,    Please do not pick up your mother at the hospital.  If she is capable of signing herself out, she is capable of finding a ride home.    You are not responsible.        I am so glad you are keeping your quit, protecting your quit.   I hope you start protecting yourself too.

Oh Sazerac, why am I so foolish?  Wish you would have gotten to me before I left.    I was there at 7:00 am this morning to get her.  She was so mean, I sat out in the hallway and waited for her.  The nurse even tried to calm her.  I have dropped her with my dad and gone home.  She will have to find her way home.   I do understand that they are scared and afraid of losing control.  What I don't understand is why she does not care that she has a caring daughter.   Oh the saga continues.  The nursing home just called and they are sending my dad back to the hospital because he is sick.  They need me to get his things out of rehab and retrieve my mom because she can not ride in the ambulance to the hospital.
    Hi Linda,   I am sorry you are going through this...you are doing amazing especially by writing here, you got this! Sending you hugs and strength.      c

I am sorry I was four hours too late !  There is no understanding or logic to your parent's behaviour towards you,  it is abominably wrong wrong wrong. Your Mom can scoop up your dad's belongings and get a jitney to the hospital.   But, I bet you are there already, poor thing.   OK, tomorrow is a new day.  Take The Day OFF.  Nurture yourself.    Get a plan together if you can. Draw the line in the sand.

Well I did not go.  The rehab transported my mom to the hospital with my dad.  My husband stopped, on his way home from work, and picked up my dad's belongings.    This actually may be a blessing because my dad is in regular hospital room and my mom will just stay overnight with him.  This way there will be someone in and out of the room and can keep an eye on her.      Have kept in touch with nurses.  My dad does have pneumonia and the nurses feel he will be there for at least three days.   Have contacted my brother, in California, and he is going to come home for a week.  My husband, son and daughter (which is unusual) are all circling the wagon and making sure I get a break.      In the meantime, I am grateful you are there to hear me vent and guide me.  My quit has really been put to the test and so far it is secure!
    I am so glad to hear your family are circling the wagons, Linda.    Please take care of yourself, friend.  Take more Vit C and Zinc to ward off flu/cold or just plain collapse.    Eat well, water water water.    You are under tremendous stress and must take extra care you don't get sick (especially since you are in and out of germ factories).        Your quit is strong.    You are powerful.   We love having you in our corner, that's for sure.
    I am so proud of you for putting Linda first... It is such a hard thing to do when you are a natural carer. Don't waste energy even trying to understand your parents some people just make no sense. What I can tell you is any flaw or fault that causes them to treat you the way they do is their's not your's. To a certain extent we have a responsibility to care for our parents in their dotage however that does not mean we have any obligation to be abused or to put up with such behaviour. If someone kept their hand in a burning flame even though it was causing pain, damage and scars you would think they were crazy there is no reason to leave their hand in the flame...well staying around to cop the emotional wounds is just as silly...which is why I am so proud you said no and stuck to your guns. You vent away beautiful lady...cos we love you just the way you are and we don't take the gift of your support and friendship and caring nature for granted, we rejoice in it.        Right that's it you need a t-shirt that says "I've got big hairy quit balls and when I say NOPE I mean it".....true on so many levels.
    Linda, I don't have wise words for you.. but I admire your courage and I can see that you are making immense choices. And writing it down, giving yourself a voice, is surely one of them.      Take care and let nothing and no one come between you and your precious quit.
    Wow Sweetie ....    I am so proud of you....you have been tested and you didn't fall over ....My hubs can be a hand full ..but your mum ...just  wow!!!!!.....I carnt hug my daughter enough ...    It's great to hear ..you are getting some support at last....Linda Time ....make the most of this help ...  You are in my heart.... Praying some peace for you......xxxxx
    Very proud of you Linda in more ways than one. They are our parents and we have to be there as we can for them now that the shoe is on the other foot.  I know how difficult things can get but hell, it couldn't have always been easy for them. I'm going through issues with my mother now and would have never dreamed this would happen. Ha ...I was always her favorite and now i can't even talk to her, but will do what I have to, to have peace with myself. Super proud of you for keeping the quit, and stay strong there is only room for improvement.

That is the part that keeps me there.  I kind of say I am working on my crown for heaven.  Regardless of who or how my parents are, I would be there.  It is my nature.  I have been that way all my life and have done the same with neighbors and friends.  My youngest brother was the golden child.  Still is and is not there to help.  You and I  will not regret it.  If you ever need to commiserate, message me any time.
    Just a little update.  My dad is still in the hospital but is finally starting to turn a corner for the better.  My mom has spent the entire time at his side.  I actually think she really felt she was losing him this time.  They are making sure he is stable before they send him on to rehab.  My mom has threatened the doctors that she will take my dad home, with paid care, if they want to put him in a nursing home.  I hate to see that too but know that, in my moms world, that would be a disaster.  Between my husband, son and daughter, I have been able to keep a healthier balance of being there.    This has truly been a test of how stress plays that part in smoking.  I have been consumed with the thoughts of sitting and relaxing with that cigarette.  Consumed yes, but acting no!  There is more of me that wants that quit and not that cigarette.  
    Glad your dad is turning the corner for the better Linda. Really glad your hubby and the kids rallied around you during this time.
    Thanks for the update, Linda.   I am so glad you are delegating responsibility and drinking deep from the cup of NOPE !
    Aww ...It sounds like your situation with the family has turned a corner ...good news ....never doubted your quit ....hugs xxx
    I’m glad to hear things are becoming a bit more bearable for you lately Linda. Keep being strong, I know I have found I rarely think of a smoke anymore. it Just doesn’t appeal to me now. That being said, I know what can happen really quick and keep that in the back of my mind. Stress is a major player in this little trip we’re on.        Keep it it up , you are doing great!
On the eve of my 1 year quit anniversary I couldn't help be reflect on what brought me to this point.       I remember 1 year ago today standing beside my car in the cold and damp, subconsciously reaching into the pocket of my coat for a cigarette. Like the thousands of others that had gone before it, I lit that smoke and took my first drag. I had just finished a coughing fit from the bronchitis I had for all of January 2017 and that first drag on the cigarette launched me into another coughing fit. Struggling to even take a breath after that, it finally dawned on me that what I was doing was completely insane!! That was the moment that literally changed my life. I knew I had to quit smoking!       For whatever reason, this event had grabbed my attention. This time it was REAL. I suddenly knew I was no "special flower" who could escape the ugly fate that many years of smoking clearly had in store for me. The next morning at 8:30 AM with no real plan in mind, I had my last cigarette.       The days that followed are a murky blur of what I perceived to be at the time, unwelcome feelings and sensations, as my body purged itself of the drug that had been present on a daily basis for over 4 decades. The highs and lows of that first week or so are indescribable to me now. I wish I had kept a blog of it all. I remember feeling like I wanted to crawl out of my own skin at times the anxiety was so pronounced. And the time ....... God Dammit!! Time was standing still! I was trapped in a never ending series of mental and physical withdrawals.       I was unsure as to what was happening to me. I was even more unsure whether I could weather this storm I was caught up in.      After a week or so of this crazy roller coaster ride, I found this place and signed up. I was welcomed, as all of you have been and was given the first glimmer of hope through the encouragement that others were extending to me. This was good! I started to read and read and read all the pinned posts and a lot of other posts. I watched numerous videos about quitting. This was the perfect distraction for me while my body and mind rebelled against the path I had chosen to take. I was on this site sometimes almost 24/7 it seemed. Sleep patterns were interrupted to say the least so here I was on the site at ungodly hours of my day and night sometimes.       Everything I read from these people who had gone before me sounded the same! It was like a broken record, repeating itself over and over. Pledge your NOPE every day. Take smoking off the table. Watch out for the Nicodemon because he will attack you at your weakest moments and try to lure you back to smoking.  Every battle you do with the Nicodemon, you get stronger and he gets weaker. This all sounded like some sort of cult like lingo to me. Could I take this seriously? Dare I believe them all? I read some more. I read how the people before them had been telling them the same things. I was ultimately convinced and decided that I too had to abide by the same critical rules if I had any hope of being successful. Blind faith had overcome me and I was all in!       From that point onward, I read and read about every phase of my quit. What had others experienced when they were at the stage I was at? 1st month, second through 3rd and fourth months when I was in No Man's Land. What had others experienced and how did they cope? This was what became my guiding light through to the time I finally became aware that I would never smoke again. I would never smoke again by my own free choice because I now knew what smoking really was. It was an addiction. It was my enemy - trying to kill me. It was certainly NOT my friend. And in the end, it's my belief that this is the point one has to reach in order to know you will be permanently quit. You need to be able to gladly choose not to smoke.     So on the eve of my 1 year quit anniversary, I don't feel a lot different than what I felt after probably 5 or 6 months quit but, this 1 year landmark is still a very special one because I have weathered the storm through all the 4 seasons and experienced all the temptations I can imagine and I know that providing I just don't ever put another cigarette in my mouth and light it on fire, I will be permanently quit        I sincerely hope to be still around and able to help each and every one of you newbies celebrate your own 1 year anniversary celebration        (Sorry for the long winded post but ......... I've earned the right to be annoying )             Edited January 29, 2018 by reciprocity

Reciprocity, reading your synopsis of the very moving year of YOUR QUIT has made me a little teary & a lot motivated. You have touched on the many phases of quitting smoking with remarkable sensitivity....I am feeling all of your fears, the stages you conquered, your steps toward freedom, your courage & your resolve to build your life without smoking. What an absolutely wonderful “night before the big day” you have shared. Thank you! I certainly look forward to your being there with the rest of the QT passengers to help Newbies like myself.

A while ago I wrote in my introduction post: 'I know it will take time, I know I want to take that time. And I am still terrified'. 160 days later I know it was worth every shiver.        Back then, all I could think of were things like, how am I going to get through the day? What will be my morning coffee like without a cig? Should I prepare myself for doomsday or will it be a matter of giving in to the proces and go with the flow? And... what if I fail, or worse, what if I succeed but my life will suck for the rest of it? Pretty ingenious stuff, really. How did I make that up!       Then, lots and lots and LOTS of debunking followed: I made it a near dayjob to research and expose every junky thought that crossed my mind. Writing them down, sharing them with this bunch of great people helped tremendously. I am not proud to admit it, but for a long time I found it too scary to cheer on newbies: afraid as I was they would give up on their quit and just disappear.. I felt I needed succes stories to feed on.        There's two major things on my 'surprsing advantages list', that I hoped would happen. It's only been two weeks or so that I dare speak of it out loud... 1. panic attacks don't find me very attractive anymore and 2. chronic underlying depression is crawling away backwards, tail between it's legs. These are huge things, concidering I've been dealing with both for almost as long as I can remember and have been therapying my ass off for at least half my life. As you may notice, I still don't talk about it as if I were super exited. I guess it needs to sink in deeper before my whole being feels safe enough to addept to these changes. But that's ok,  that will happen.         It is possible to go through life events and remain smokefree, even early on. Someone I held dear, passed away. Insanely sad, because it was her (unexpected) own choice. I can't imagine what nightmare her loved ones are going through. It's also a theme that I've been struggeling with twice, around my 20s. (Grateful to be able to speak about it). So, memories and tears on different levels. Biggest trigger came knocking on my door: disconnectedness. But hey, I wouldn't do it the old way anymore right? So, I figured out ways to connect, even if it was calling a friend in the middle of the night and say nothing at all.      And then last weekend, relationship bomb crash tragedy. Something that was bound to happen and kept being postponed by the both of us. I experience pain, relief, fear of lonelyness, a cautious thinking of the future. I know that processing will come in waves... and most likely at least some of the waves will test my willpower. Amidst all this, I have a little glint about keeping my quit. Because really, nobody is taking this away from me. I will fight for it, no matter what. (And I will rise like a godd*mn phoenix, but that sounds so theatrical).        The reason I choose to write these things so openly, is that they happen. They are real, human events and they tell stories of brittleness. Where I live, 1 in 4 people has to deal, at some point in their lives, with mental illness. Thats huge. People lose people and that hurts. There's no pretending about that.        To all newbies and lurkers, do protect what is solely yours. Don't make events or people responsible for lighting up.. find your strength, dig deep or stay shallow and plaugh on if thats what works for you. Please know that this is doable also for you and know that every person here has their story.    I believe our stories shape us, but by quitting we can turn things around: we are shaping our stories.           Edited January 29 by MLMR
    Remarkable writing.
    What a splendid testimonial, M'life.    You have shaped your story in a truthful and accessible way.    Thank you for taking the time to share it with all of us.   We are behind you and beside you.
    MLMR you actually are my hero.  Being able to freely talk about your struggles with mental illness and share it with others is so brave.  There has always been such a stigma associated with mental illness, many of us who deal with the same issues are afraid to talk about it.  Following you story is a true inspiration.  I hope you realize how strong you are and know that you will also be able to weather the decision to end your relationship.   Be patient, pamper yourself and know that the best is yet to come.
    Good post MLMR. Thanks for sharing it.
    A lovely honest  post M...  It's been a pleasure to have been on your journey with us....   Watching you get stronger ,is great to witness...you are a strong lady...I'm so proud of you ...
    Thank you for sharing this MLMR...xoxo
    Fabulous insights, MLMR.....this especially resonated with me "Amidst all this, I have a little glint about keeping my quit. Because really, nobody is taking this away from me. I will fight for it, no matter what."      You are a warrior woman, that is for sure.....so proud of you!
    It never ceases to amaze me how quitting smoking makes us grow so much within ourselves...it's like when the 'smoke' clears there is a new clarity, a new strength and a new awareness not just to what is around us but also what is within us. Thank you so much for sharing your story and your journey with us @MLMR... Be proud of you because you should be.
    That was an outstanding read MLMR. Thank you for sharing and stay true to yourself.
    I have had a couple smoking dreams last week, Now last night i must say the real dreams started, These ar the dreams one can feel the smoke in the lungs and   Taste the tabaco.   This time I was not startled when I woke up, It was AHA I know you.  I am starting to get lazy at times and then a dynamo when something aroses me,   I have been able to contrl most of my emotions, especially the anger and irritability,  Its the suden leak that gushes from my eyes that catch me by surprise and that is when I am ussually alone.  I'll be in my truck in the drive way collecting my stuff and a song that brings the forth the flood.  I wont try to stop it, I figure that it has been a long time since my eyes have been beluged with soft water.   In a couple more weeks the trigger should be mostly disarmed and the cravings should be not much more than dreams.  In this quite place is where I must be digalent, I need to arm my self with mental ammo to combat the soft low guesturing that it is OK now, the you proved you could walk away thoughts, the  you can have one.  Yes in this silence I will need to be prepaired. 
    While you sleep your cilia are scrubbing the tar and nicotine off which stimulates your sense of taste and smell.               You are doing really great, Opah.   It is really cool to watch you build a sturdy quit  and to see you jump in and be an important part of community.   I am so happy you are here.     Your emotions can be all over the place while you return to your original human state.  Water your eyes, they will grow.    Try and understand your anger, it will dissipate        Remember how much fun you had last weekend ?    Imagine yourself back in your sanctuary.             
The next couple of weeks are going to be Honey do weekends. the the 8th, 9th and 10th The wife and I will be up at the Refuge.  It will be so nice, a little work to do but mostly just us Being sloths, waking up Late, eating breakfast at noon.     Yes it will be nice
    Lol..O....I never had a smoking dream ,I never slept much ...I can only imagine how weird that would feel...    Thankfully you were only dreaming ...   Sounds like peaceful times ahead ....brilliant....I'm jealous ....breakfast at noon...magic !!!!
I told the nicotine habit to go F... itself about 16 months ago. AND I still get smoking dreams. Like a couple nights ago i dreamed my room mate and i were working on her car and I found a cigarette in the garage and smoked it. In the dream though, I found some way to control the crave so i only wanted to smoke every few days.    But in reality we know how THAT works - "just one" sets off the habit pretty quick again.           15 hours ago, Doreensfree said:             Lol..O....I never had a smoking dream ,I never slept much ...I can only imagine how weird that would feel...

Like it is harmless, tasty, and all that? In smoking dreams, it really is.   Like my sister put it - "the satisfaction of smoking but without any of the consequences".Edited January 30 by Jet Black
Not my room mate's gas for once, no, something else...      I was at work the other day and in the break room rummaging the paper for the comics.       There was this entire page advertisement for one of those vape things.  Of COURSE it was saying something about using vape to quit cigarettes. Imagine.     But here was the LOUD part - the entire top 1/4 of the page was blacked out with the words in white about this product contains nicotine and nicotine is addictive. Now folks, not even cigarette and snuff ads got a warning label that big. All tobacco ever got was a puny space in the bottom corner of the page, easily overlooked.        Even though I have never vaped, i still hate it. I hope the vape companies are losing sleep knowing that they are under fire quicker and harder than tobacco ever has been.     It is kind of like when someone lies to you, the first time you believe it but when you figure out it is BS you get mad. But then they try to lie to you AGAIN and you f*****g explode! The anti-nicotine people (especially us ex-smokers) are probably more pissed than anyone. I love seeing vape companies getting their asses kicked.      I just hope these kids who see vape ads will ask, "how come that warning is so huge...?"

After they vape or use an e-cigg for a year or two and try a cigg a lot claim they get sick. so sick they wont smoke a cigg but go back to e-cigg or vape. This is the start and later on we will hear of the illnesses
    So basically then once they start vaping, they are stuck?   I have a very hard time believing that vape is any safer than a damn cigarette.

G’day   There was a time ( yes I was a 40 year smoker) when they started to put the cigs to be safer.   First it was filters. No I didn’t smoke at that time but by the time I did I wouldn’t smoke anything without one “ cause it was safer.” Hell they even brought out filters for roll your owns to make them sound safer.     Then it was making cigs with lower nicotine levels by putting pin holes in the butt and proudly making the claim that it was somehow safer to smoke. And the worse thing people, believed by that by smoking the lower nicotine levels One was able to give up. What a crock off sh1t that was. Now that want us to believe that vaping is not only “safe” but allows people to give up the cigs.   Its still full of addictive nicotine, you’ll still be addicted customer for life but don’t worry it’s safer....     And this is from the same people who have continually lied in the past. Have they suddenly got it right?    I know they couldn’t.   Same Crowd Same Lies

OK not sure why bit a Blan morning today.  I guess all the stimulous has started to where off,  yes sir I was riding hight there for a week.    My bigest challenge Yet has just emerged, it has slapped me around and confussed me, But I fought back !  At ojne point I thought i was really screwed but turned out it was a blessing in Descuise.  Setting here staring at it so Handsum and made of Precous metal, it even talks to me and follows my commands. But just like the last one its going to work its way into my life, become almost indespincable and when I need it most it is going to abandon me and fail.  it will leave me in sillence and without assistance.     I dont know why it is, I guess a have a weakness for shinny PYTs, and once I get them I cover them up too afraid Ill scratch or dull them.  I know it will happen  sooner or Later the luster will wear off, and the afair will be over, it will become mondain nothing at all special, no one will care about it any more, not even Me.  Yes it my new fasination and Facuation, its my Galaxy S7 Titainium Edge phone !   Yes to others she may be out dated, but to me she shines, her silky smouth case can easily slip thru your fingers,  thus the need to hold on tight, and dress her apropriately.   Just bought her a Cammo cover with velcro flap, belt clip and kick stand, yes she will still be styling even being covered up.
Wow.... First ..more important ..your fabulous 3 weeks ...a huge achievement ...I hope your feeling very proud ...  Phones......no ...I am crap at technology.... Ask this lot .... Sounds like you have a passionate love affair going on there...nothing wrong with that ...lol..

There is a lot of misinformation about how soon nicotine leaves your body.Many are saying, three days but, this doesn't seem to be the truth.Nicotine is far more pernicious and sticky, if you will.    I know I celebrated the 'three days free of nicotine' but I would have rather known the truth.so, in the spirit of Truth,   I give you this from DrugRehab.com  "Nicotine can be traced in saliva for up to four days, in blood for about 10 days, in urine for up to three weeks and in hair for up to three months."  in Medical News Today   "According to the American Association for Clinical Chemistry,it can take over 2 weeks for a person's blood to reach the same cotinine levels as someone who does not use tobacco.It takes several more weeks for the urine levels to become very low.Traces of nicotine may stay in the hair for longer.The more someone smokes, and the higher the frequency of smoking, the longer nicotine takes to leave the body.The exact length of time it takes for nicotine to clear differs between people:Nicotine may stay in the body for longer in adults aged over 65 years.Women tend to process nicotine more quickly than men, especially if they are taking birth control pills.The body will take longer to remove nicotine in people who have smoked more frequently and for longer."     Here is more evidenceHealthline  How long does Nicotine Stay in Your Bodyfrom IPRC &nbsp;  Nicotine Distribution and ExcretionFrom the Mayo Clinic, Nicotine and Metablolites, Serum    We are not playing with a nice drug. Nicotine is sticky, not to mention the zillion other chemicals we were freebasing while smoking.  This is all the more reasons to quit, quit early and celebrate each and every day you are nicotine free.
    Great post, this topic came up when someone was going for life insurance. Thanks!
    Yuck.  Now that I am finally quitting - I just want it out!  Why oh why did it take so long for that light bulb to go off!!!!!
I guess I'll have to celebrate again in 3 months and just enjoy the other health benefits until then.

This is from Red Orbit   How Long Does Nicotine Stay in Your Blood and BodyArchJanuary 21, 2019  Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances, which makes smoking a habit that’s notoriously hard to shake. And even if one manages to quit, traces of the substance will still be present in one’s system days after going cold turkey.E-cigarettes are considered a less harmful alternative to conventional cigarettes. However, e-cigarette cartridges contain as much as 21 to 85% nicotine. The body won’t know the difference so it will absorb the nicotine just the same.So, how long does nicotine stay in your blood and body? To get the answer, you should take a closer look at the way and rate the human body absorbs this dangerous toxin.     SMOKING AND NICOTINE INGESTIONTobacco companies make sure to provide a variety of cigarettes to suit individual nicotine addicts. On average, a single cigarette has 12 milligrams of nicotine, about 1 milligram of which reaches the bloodstream.Once inside the bloodstream, nicotine tests measure nicotine concentration in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). This depends on individual smoking habits. For example, the average smoker may have up to 50ng/ml of cotinine – one of the nicotine metabolites – in their blood. But for heavy smokers, the levels can reach a staggering 500ng/ml.     HOW LONG DOES NICOTINE STAY IN YOUR BLOOD?It’ll take about a couple of hours after smoking for your body to remove 50% of the ingested nicotine. On average, it can still be detected in the bloodstream for one to three days after you stopped smoking.The primary nicotine metabolite, cotinine, can show up in blood tests even after 10 days. The time it takes to fully purge either nicotine or cotinine from the blood may depend on the severity of the smoking habit and individual metabolism.   As for the tests, they can be divided into two categories: quantitative test for the amount of nicotine and qualitative test for the presence of the substance. But you are not out of the woods after three days. Most of the tests also look for the major nicotine metabolites, cotinine and anabasine, which are both alkaloids that stay in the blood for much longer than nicotine.   There is also a strong possibility of a false positive. The culprit for this is the chemical called thiocyanate, which appears in the bloodstream as a result of smoking but is also common in some medications and foods like cabbage and broccoli.    HOW LONG DOES NICOTINE STAY IN YOUR URINE?Things are a bit different with nicotine urine tests. For casual smokers, detectable cotinine levels can be present in urine for up to four days. This might go up to three weeks for heavy smokers.  The amount of cotinine or nicotine detected depends on the timing of the urine sample. For example, those who haven’t quit smoking may have up to 1,000 ng/mL of the substance in their urine. But a couple of weeks after quitting, the levels usually drop precipitously but may stay above 30 ng/mL, the threshold for a positive result.    The labs use different reference ranges to interpret nicotine tests. So, if need be, you might need to go over the results with your physician.     HAIR FOLLICLE AND SALIVA TESTBesides blood and urine, trace amounts of nicotine stay in your saliva and hair follicles. In fact, certain hair follicle tests might show positive results up to a year after the last nicotine exposure. But generally, traces of nicotine usually stay in hair follicles for about three months.    When it comes to saliva, it takes your body about four days to purge the saliva of nicotine and cotinine. Unlike hair follicle tests, saliva is commonly used to test for nicotine.     FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE NICOTINE LEVELSSome common rules are applicable here. As previously stated, certain individual factors also apply and may be responsible for a prolonged presence of the substance.Smokers can be divided into three categories.     Those who smoke once a week are considered light users.Their body generally gets rid of traceable nicotine in about three days after the last exposure.     Moderate users are those who smoke a few times a week and they may expect to test positive for a couple of weeks after quitting.    People who smoke on a daily basis fall under the heavy user category. The nicotine in their blood, urine, and saliva might linger for up to twelve months.      But there are other factors that come into play.With age, it becomes more difficult for the body to deal with nicotine. And the genetic makeup may also play a significant role. Certain studies indicate that Caucasian and Hispanic people metabolize the substance quicker than African and Asian people.    Hormones and liver enzymes may influence the amount of nicotine in the body as well. For example, women who take estrogen or are pregnant might get rid of nicotine faster than men.    HOW TO PURGE NICOTINE FROM YOUR BLOOD AND BODYAbstaining from cigarettes and other products that contain nicotine is the best way to get the toxin out of your system. During abstinence, the cells work hard to remove traces of nicotine from your body.In addition, there are a few things that you can do to expedite this process.     The first line of defense is being well-hydrated. In other words, the more water you drink, the faster the nicotine leaves via your urine.  An antioxidant-rich diet helps as well. Some of the foods you should go for include carrots and oranges. They contain immunity-boosting antioxidants and fibers which may accelerate nicotine removal.  Another way to boost your metabolism is to take up exercise. Nicotine and all of its metabolites are released through sweat when exercising.    THE FINAL PUFFIf you haven’t stopped smoking, now is as good a time as any to start. After abstaining from nicotine for a few months, there’ll be no need to wonder how long does nicotine stay in your blood.  REFERENCES:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2946180/https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/3/176https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0091743579900124https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Anabasine#section=Tophttps://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/15D8BBF6393C6093C2076546E6515457/S1834261214000279a.pdf/nicotine_pharmacology_toxicity_and_therapeutic_use.pdfhttps://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/23/suppl_2/ii30https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/electronic-cigarettes-good-news-bad-news-2016072510010

My 9 year old daughter asked me the other day if my lungs were more black or pink.  I talk to her about smoking, vaping etc. so she knows the truth about this stuff.  My Mom and my Aunt have never taken a single puff of a cigarette, despite growing up with both parents who smoked, all her brothers, uncles, aunts etc.  My goal is to teach my daughter now so she knows the consequences of smoking, vaping etc. so she doesn't even want to try any of it.
Well 14 Days done, I am sted fast and full of commitment,  you guys are the gravity of my quit world    Each of you, all of you, a vital suport, This time around will be my forever quit.  I have dedicated myself to my quit and to the assitance to others quits.        Thank you one and all
    Congratulations, Opah on your FREEDOM ! and thank you so much for all you give to us.    
    Well done O !!! All the hard work is down to you ....but have to agree ..having a good support group makes all the difference...of course this is your sticky quit !!!.....
    Woohoo, congrats on two weeks Opah!  
Celibrating with a Couple Wennersschnitzel Chilli cheese Dog, a beer would be nice but at work, but 5 hours from now !! The celibration is ON
Congrats on 2 weeks Opah, enjoy your cheese dogs..
    Congrats opah!
    Now you did it, made me hungry again !  So much for that chilli cheese Burger I was saving for lunch.
    Good on ya Opah!
    Congratulations Opah!
    Congratulations!  Glad to see you're celebrating!  You deserve it because staying quit for two weeks is no small feat!  
Just returned from a 5 day Hunting trip, and I am still a non smoker !  There were some moments there I did want a puff, the cold of the Morning, the cold of the evening and when My hunt was successful.  But all was good, getting easier to just tell myself no  aint going to Happen.  Still popping Ricolas,  helps redirect the want.  I AM ONE VERY HAPPY NON SMOKER !
    Good for you Opah  
That is great Opah.  5 days is almost through tough week.  You can do this.  Keep that quit going.
Yaaa...great news 0.....    Good trip all round I say ...high five !!!

    Thats how its done...
    Great news, Opah !  Facing lots of triggers and patterns and staying smoke free is a great accomplishment !     Very happy about your successes, quit and hunt !
    I remember last quit when I disarmed the triggers, they were solid, easy to grasp onto what they were, and once disarmed easy to keep away or avoid.    These time around it is not so solid,  more of a mist or fog,  a Ghost ! have not been smoking any where near as long, less than a year.    Not any really must smoke conditions, places or events to speak of except driving,  But none the less very softly in the background they are.   Dosn't seem to be a problem they can be dissmissed fairely easily just totally different this time around.  Just needed to write and to give these Ghostist triggers some substance. 
So I'm just over 3 months quit... 3 months 11 days to be exact.... officially the longest I've gone without a cigarette..... and it is really really hard. I feel like I quit 3 days ago. I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread right now. I am constantly thinking about and craving a cigarette. The only thing that I can do to keep myself from smoking is not smoke (it make sense to me) and that's getting harder to do. I keep reminding myself why I am doing this and all the benefits I have seen so far, but the urge really feels stronger than my sense of joy/greatfulness/contempt... ect. It's like "yup. Made it 3 months. Don't really care that it's the longest I gone just really want a cigarette."     This Sucks. Still not smoking,Edited January 21 by I Got This (T)
    Hi IGT,  "The only thing that I can do to keep myself from smoking is not smoke (it make sense to me) and that's getting harder to do" I had to replace the crutch that was smoking to me with something else. I used exercise , a straw and a fake cigg to make believe. Candy, move a muscle change a thought was the key for me. We blow our quits when we lose direction or just don't give a F.  Check out No mans land             
    Yep, I remember feeling like you at three and four months quit. Sounds like no man's land to me too. Glad you're smart enough to keep your quit because I promise it will start getting better real soon so hang in there 
Stay strong and it will get better. 3 plus months quit is huge. I would do whatever to keep it . If you have made it this far you are strong enough to keep the quit and smart enough to know giving in will only cause you pain and disappointment. If you have made it this far this is what you want for yourself. Better days will come. Best wishes.
    IGT you are doing well.  What you are going thru is common, as said before study up on no mans land as said above.  It really does get better, just be strong and try to shift your focus to the positives from quitting this.  It is good you posted -- shows your strength -- Keep it up!!!!
IGT,  I remember some earlier posts of you were you where very happy and even proud about yourself. Please think back of that and imagine yourself like that again, because that is how it will be soon enough! You will be proud, you will be relieved and you will be so happy about not giving up!       How are you now?Edited January 22 by MLMR
You got this... That's why you chose that name, because you knew you're gonna stick it out.     It's tough whenever there's a craving, but our brains are being rewired so no one promised it would be easy. But 3 months is right around when your skin quality is improving, your heart attack rates have considerably dropped, your gums have started repairing themselves, of course the ton of money you've already saved means you can pamper yourself with it.       I understand it is super tough, but your body deserves to be taken care of, so it can take care of you as the years go on.      Stick it out IGT, you truly got this!!! I believe in you.
Congrats on your fabulous 3 months Smoke Free.....  I can only mirror what all the above have said ...It really does get better ..Stick at it ....
    Be SURE to keep rewarding yourself every time you beat a crave !    Replace smokey thoughts immediately by looking at something pretty like that light on that leaf or something/someone you love.  Your quit is young, protect it with your life   and don't forget to have fun.   You Quit Smoking.  End Of.       
I'm sorry you are struggling but can be normal during the first few months.  Keep fighting, things will get better IGT.  3 months is a great accomplishment and it is not worth throwing away for a cigarette.  Smoking will do nothing positive at all.
    IGT Don't get off the train because it is going to take you to beautiful destinations!  I am so proud of my quit and each month quit I feel prouder.  Just hang tough, these feeling will pass. 
Thanks everyone for your kind words and encouragement. I will get thru this. I was a little taken back at just how strong and overwhelming my yearning for a cigarette was/is after 3 months. I'm not cranky really that I can't have one..... not any more pissy.... not barking at people.... I am quite a bit more anxious however..... have that anxious feeling in my tummy all the time, because I feel like I am in a constant battle with my brain telling it I don't want to smoke. I feel my mind racing, but not really in any particular direction.... it's almost like I am going thru a tunnel at the speed of light... with tracers and passing sounds on both sides of me.... at the end of the tunnel is the end of my cravings..... the light if you will.... and I'm stuck right in the middle... just floating...while everything else keeps passing by.....

There is light at the end of the tunnel, always.
Just a word from one who fell off of the train with just under a year nicotine free:    There is no such thing as just a taste, or just one or only today, it will end your Quit !  There were a couple times that I came very close to loosing it and the 3 month makers was one of them.  It got quite, the Rah Rah Rahs were gone, I got quite and farther from the forum, it was soon the only voice    I heared was the naging of that little nicotine memory,  Just a puff and it picked the most desiriable moments. I can't tell you when or if every one can go without the support of caring people that personally know what you are going thru, what I can tell you is This loving Caring people are like air for me, Can't see, can't touch, but they  keep me stronge safe and secure.    Continue to use us, write write write, about anything, what ever you feel you need to write about.  As I have heard and will continue to hear it does get easier  and it does !  Just got to be cautious during the slack times.
Tomorrow I'll be celebrating 5 months. And where part of the third and all of the fourth month honestly seemed like they never ended, the past fifth month was one of, uhm... whats it called? Reaping what Ive sown?       I think I should start saying it out loud, because I cant go around it anymore, it's too darn obvious: my anxiety attacks are rapidly decreasing in number and in ferocity. Mind this: I came from 2 to 3 HEAVY attacks per week, where time in between was just too little to unwind. They varied from sudden, fullblown 30minute apocalypses, to gradual tension build up, which could last half a day and leave me completely numb. It's been like that for years.   And now... I went down to 1 in two weeks, with bits and pieces of distress in between but totally incomparable to what its been. I believe part of that is because I'm paying so much more attention to what I need, when I need it ('HALT'!). I am really learning to just be with what I feel. And yep, it still s*cks from time to time. And then that's just that.      And by the way, while writing this I still have this nagging voice that says something like, 'ahhh just wait... it'll be back soon enough...dont hold your hopes so high!.'. But I know that this isn't incidental.         This is progress for the long run and I am going to be so, so, so sooooo very thankful for having quit and gaining peace of mind.       And... I am growing a super mighty ' I won't' muscle. Applicable on a daily basis, to many non-smoking related things!
    Great post MLMR, I'm really happy to read this! You are doing awesome and it's GREAT that your anxiety attacks are getting to be so few and far between  
    Great post M...don't look now...the magic has started to happen ...way to go !!!

    It is amazing the inner trust we build within ourselves by quitting smoking and the confidence we acquire to slay our demons.   This trust and strength does not fade and like a muscle gets stronger and stronger with use.    Congratulations M'Life, you have a splendid quit and I am so happy you are reaping rewards of your work.    You Rock.   S

    I was having a chat with hubby,s carer this morning...  She told me her Mum has cancer of the mouth, which has spread to her jaw bone...This coming week,she will have a operation to remove half of her tongue,and some of her jaw bone ...replacing it from bone from her leg...  I say...please tell me she has quit smoking now.... Not at all she told me ..   I could smell stale smoke on her breath too...  I just found this very sad...they both still believe all the lies surrounded by smoking.....    Very sad 
    I've lost two friends to cancer of the mouth. It's a horrible cancer to have. Both of them had so many procedures done, including removing parts of their tongues,  to try to stop it and both ended up succumbing to it 
    Awful....she says her bottom lip will be numb ..so will not be able to eat properly... This woman is in her fifties ... Im with you Jillar horrible ...I'm sorry about your friends ...I am so grateful i have been spared this ....well so far ...

Very sad                I still remember well visiting my grandfather in hospice care.  Seeing a man I loved dearly at the end of the line, succumbing to cancer after years of smoking.  First thing I did when I stepped outside: light up a cigarette.       Addiction is insidious.
    The fear of being without nicotine is greater than the fear of losing body parts or even life for some.  I wonder if the real fear is that they can succeed in quitting smoking.  I sometimes see smokers and want to tell them, "quit - don't be afraid, it won't hurt you."

Gday    A news report from Australia where it’s not legal to sell vaping liquids that contain nicotine. Testing has shown over 1/2 do contain nicotine. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-12/not-all-e-juices-are-as-nicotine-free-as-they-claim/9857540  Pretty disturbing as many unwitting are putting nicotine into bodies.
    Hey @Cbdave, what's it like up north... I don't think Vaping is as big a thing here as it is in the northern hemisphere, I know its not in Melbourne, there are vapers bet we all think they are a littls wanky and its not that common.... how is it in the land of the banana and cane toad?
G’day   I know of a few people that vape and sort of fluctuate between the vape and cigerettes so I don’t think it’s a real way of weaning of the cigs. All I hear from them is the same kind of excuses as I used as a smoker.     One friend said something to me once that really stuck a note with me and I’ve never forgot it. When I asked him why he didn’t vape anymore his rely was that one night when drinking he went through enough vape to be equal to 80 cigs. No sore throat or anything to warn him to back off. He only realised next day and gave it away as he was worried that he could poison himself. He had friends that had been made sick as there was not way to tell how strong the stuff was. He still smokes cigerettes.   No nicotine based juice can legally be sold here so there is no regulation or standards to protect anyone. That’s a worry, it’s worse than illegal drugs you don’t know what your going to get through the mail from some clown on the internet.   Sorta a bit worrying when it’s suposed to be safer than smoking cigs.   So vapers that I know are still smokers really they just change between the nicotine delievery style, the addictions the same.  Like smoking I hate the addiction but like the people cause I was that addict once  C
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/new-program-launched-help-curb-teen-vaping-epidemic-n960371?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma          Jan. 18, 2019, 2:17 PM EST  By Cynthia McFadden and Kenzi Abou-Sabe WASHINGTON — When Principal Kimberly Martin sent out the Woodrow Wilson High School weekly newsletter over winter break, she was looking for help.  Martin's school, the largest in the nation's capital, was experiencing the same phenomenon that teachers and principals across the country have described over the last year — an explosion in teen vaping use — but her budget didn't allow for the substance abuse program she'd used at her previous school. In her newsletter, Martin quoted Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who had just called youth vaping an epidemic, and posted pictures of e-cigarettes that had been confiscated on campus.   "When I got here, I would say there was an issue with it, but I think it's gotten worse, progressively worse, over the last four years," said Martin, who estimates that roughly half of the juniors and seniors are using e-cigarettes.    Woodrow Wilson High School Principal Kimberly MartinTODAY   Struggling to grapple with the epidemic, the Food and Drug Administration is holding a public hearing Friday to solicit ideas on the best interventions to curb youth e-cigarette use.  Among the presenters at the forum in Silver Spring, Maryland, will be Truth Initiative, a nonprofit best known for its envelope-pushing anti-smoking ads aimed at teens and young people. The group has now created a first-of-its kind text messaging program designed to help young people quit vaping.   "We started seeing more and more that people were posting that their New Year's resolution was to leave JUUL and to quit e-cigarettes, but they weren't finding any help," said Megan Jacobs, who works on Truth's innovations team and led the project. "So we said, 'Hey, we've got programs. We could adapt those programs to help people quit e-cigarettes as well as we could help them quit smoking.'"    The program, which officially launches Friday, allows anyone to text "QUIT" to 202-804-9884, anonymously and free of charge. Users are then asked to choose an age bracket so they can start receiving tailored daily text messages of support and tips for quitting. Truth worked with young people who had either quit or were trying to quit, to make the program's messaging more effective.    The program, which officially launches Friday, allows anyone to text "QUIT" to 202-804-9884, anonymously and free of charge.TODAY   According to the latest CDC data, 3.05 million high school students and 570,000 middle-schoolers were using e-cigarettes in 2018. That's a total of 3.62 million kids, up from only 280,000 in 2011.    The numbers have spiked since the 2015 introduction of Juul, a cartridge-based e-cigarette that's been wildly popular with kids. Current use among high school students rose 78 percent in a single year, from 2017 to 2018.    Dr. Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine whose research centers on adolescent addiction and substance use, said there is still a sizable gap in researchers' understanding of e-cigarette use and how drug therapies may affect young vapers.   "We can't say just because you are vaping e-cigarettes I am going to give you a nicotine patch or nicotine gum, because we don't really know how addicted these kids are to the nicotine in e-cigarettes," Krishnan-Sarin said. "We need to need to understand that first before we move to the medication realm."  Krishnan-Sarin said behavioral approaches, on the other hand, have a proven track record when it comes to youth smokers.    "Not telling kids what to do, but educating them about what's bad about the product, these kinds of behavioral techniques have shown to be effective for youth smoking combustible cigarettes," she said. "We have found over time that if you educate kids and make them understand by presenting information to them in a non-judgmental fashion, they come to the conclusion themselves."    Recommended politicsImpeachment talk grows louder after report Trump told Cohen to lie to Congress  featureJudge rules against elderly lesbians rejected from retirement home   The Truth Initiative adopts the same philosophy, offering users messages focused on delivering education and motivation rather than fear.   "You can't frighten people into changing their behavior. It doesn't work in losing weight, it doesn't work in exercise, and it doesn't work here," Truth Initiative CEO Robin Koval said.   Teenage users of the program could get messages like, "Is it hard to not JUUL in places you're not supposed to, like school? Reply YES or NO." There's also an option for parents designed to educate them about the devices and help them support children dealing with nicotine addiction.    Truth Initiative used the structure of their quit-smoking programs of the past, but the messages were completely rewritten. The program creators were particularly mindful that the experience of vaping is unique from smoking, Koval said.    "Some of the negative cues from smoking—you know, your hair smells, your clothes smell, your fingers are yellow — all of that sort of thing that makes you want to quit are not as present in vaping," Koval said. "So we have to work with other sorts of messages and cues to help you see even the benefits of your quit process."   Martin, the principal at Wilson High, is hoping many of her students will soon be experiencing those benefits.  After she sent out her e-cigarette-focused newsletter, Martin received grateful messages from several parents, including one who works for Truth Initiative. "I've got an idea," the parent wrote in an email.  Wilson will now serve as a testing ground for Truth Initiative's text message-based quit-vaping program, with a unique phone number so that the organization's researchers can analyze how the Wilson community interacts with it.  "We're going to put it in the newsletter. We're going to put it on our website. We plan to do robocalls and all of the kind of methods that we communicate with parents to get people aware that this campaign is happening," Martin said.  Anya, a senior at Wilson High School who regularly uses e-cigarettes, said she's considering enrolling in the program. "I've always looked at the 'smoke to quit' ads on the metro and I've thought, 'That's a good idea. Maybe I should tell some friends of mine who smoke a lot of cigarettes about that,'" Anya said. "So I think, yeah, there could be one for vaping. There's a niche for that."
     
Rainy Days !  Now after like a week of Rain it really came down hard this morning, so Hard you could hear it beating down on the roof of the DC.    And Then BAM it hit me, this huge trigger a wantin desire to smoke, and all the pleasure imaging that goes with it !    Damn lucky I still have the super quiter power Lin instilled me with this morning.  Popped some B12s and sucking on a Ricola. hands busy today  and I have my hoodie to stay warm .   HAAA HAAA  you viale nicotine Habit, I don't need you for warmth, I don't need you for my hands to be busy, i don't need you because its wet and raining, as A matter of Fact MR Nicotine, I don;t need you at all   !!

    As I was leaving Hell week I looked ahead,  the assent wasn’t as steep and the obstacles were fewer.    Thinking of how happy and accomplished I felt,  I suddenly started to sob, uncontrollably sob after a few minutes it Was done.  I thought to Myself what the Hell was that !    A soft comforting voice from over the mountain said, welcome to What the Heck week Opah.

    I just found this,  hope you like it too.    
One of my favorite posts....from member Paul723 "Your quit is like a baby you carry on your chest. You protect it from harm. You never leave it behind or discard it. You know anything someone says bad about it is a lie and you know it is the best thing you have. You don't let life come between you and your quit. You never think that something would be easier to do if you left it behind. This is simply not an option. You feel its heartbeat and you keep it warm and alive.AndYouDon'tSmoke."
I looked for the exact quote and wasn't able to find it, but Paul said something to the effect of: "You can't fight the waves, but you can learn to surf." Wise words.
I looked for the exact quote and wasn't able to find it, but Paul said something to the effect of: "You can't fight the waves, but you can learn to surf." Wise words.Love this: I wrote this a while ago for someone who was struggling, and was asked to share it.  This person had said that she was having waves of anxiety and smoking thoughts.  I hope it can help someone!   Ride the wave, man, it's like, gnarly.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  OK, I might be taking a metaphor too far here, but...you know how at the beach when you want to swim out beyond the breakers?  To where it is nice and calm and you can just float.  As you wade in, it seems like the waves keep wanting to push you back to shore.  And at first they knock you over-- they tumble and toss you underwater; they throw you into the sand, and you can't even tell which way is up.  But you are tenacious, and you want to get beyond the breakers.  So this time you try to just pretend the waves aren't there.  You turn your back to them and plant your feet, but they still smack you on the back; they leave a red mark and they push you over.  But this time it didn't push you over all the way-- you are still in the water.  You don't have to wade back anymore.  The next wave that comes, you decide to turn your body sideways and jump a little bit.  It feels weird to jump at first, but then you realize that you actually have more control that way.  That little jump, that leap of faith, makes things so much easier.  This time, you feel the power of the wave, but it doesn't hurt you.   Next, you see a really big wave coming.  It looks ominous.  It's already starting to break. You know that if you try to stand up to it, it will just tumble your butt back to shore.  It might rip off your bathing suit top while it's at it.  You can't flail around, you can't turn your back, you can't even turn to the side.  Instead, you take a deep breath, and you just dunk yourself underwater and wait for it to roll over you.  You come back up, and you're a little panicked.  Where are you??  But within an instant you realize that you are beyond the breakers, right where you want to be.  Where it is calm, and you can see the shore, and just float.  This time, you felt the power of the wave, and you allowed it to help you. I think you are at the point where you are turning yourself sideways.  Hang on, pretty soon you will be diving headlong into those waves.  I'll see you at the beach soon with my boogie board!

Your advice that night was also excellent Nancy: It makes me mad that smoking does not fix any of the things I used to think it fixed.  And that I have to learn to fix everything in a different way.  And then sometimes the light bulb goes on and I realize that it is not my job to fix it, or that it is not in my power to fix it, or, in my case, I am trying to fix things that are none of my business... SoberJulie had worked it out for herself earlier like this: You don't have to be #1 at anything today.You don't have to figure things out, or understand, or make sure everyone (or Someone) understands you.You don't have to remember everything, or get all organized and start making lists.You don't have to solve every -- or any -- problem you have today (or solve someone else's problems today either).You don't have to figure out what will make you happy, or what you should do with your life.Those are good things to do of course, and come with a measure of reward or satisfaction or comfort. That's very true. I'm not saying those things are completely unimportant.But you don't have to do any of those things today.All you have to do today is not pick up that first cigarette.One hour at a time.One five minutes at a time.Until your head hits the pillow.And if you do that,you win.That's it.And the rest of that s*** will just have to work itself out or wait its turn.Smoke free first.The rest second.
Hi Nancy!!!
    bump
Who will be born in July 2019... I promise you wont have a Nan who stinks like an ashtray.......only sweet fresh kisses for you     I'm so excited and looking forward to meeting you..
Congratulations Nan Catlover..... what a great Chrissy present that news was... and your lucky grandbaby will not be getting stinky nan hugs ..... great way to celebrate your 11 month anni.
    Thank you Jo....... Yes no stinky Nanny here.. no nipping off out every hour missing out on the cuddles, and touching baby with stinky fingers ..oooh no..... 
    Congratulations ....there is no better love ,than that of a Nanna....its so special.... What better reason to Keep The Quit ...xxxxx
    Congrats on the great news CL! Yet another reason to stay smoke-free  
    Congratulations catlover, how exciting for you 
    Lovely news, catlover, and even more incentive to keep your precious quit.
    Catlover what great news for the New Year and yes to be a smoke free grandparent will be so awesome!!!
    Oh Catlover, how exciting.  Grand kids are the best.  You are going to have many wonderful magic moments and memories ahead.  Quitting smoking, you will have the energy and a lifetime to enjoy them.  We will all be anxiously waiting the pictures!
    Catlover, late to the news as seems to be the case these days. I'm so very happy for you and your family.       Cats everywhere will still be celebrating the new generation.       A beautiful start to the year. 
    Wowie Catlover, congratulations.        You're gonna be a phenomenal Nan, full of energy to keep up with the little champ.
    Thank you, all going well, and my knitting is improving 
My work day usually starts at 9:00 am--or, at least, it has been for a few weeks. Today I begin work at 12:30. Time is motionless. The sensation of being suspended in air is unsettling, and in such a state of mind, I want a cigarette. This is a situation when, in the past, I would smoke. It would be a time--smoking--when I would collect my thoughts. A grounding time.       Since I haven't been smoking for the past month (yaay), this would be a time when I would eat something sweet. I've begun reversing the trend of weight gain, so no sweets to provide a dopamine hit.   Feeling fatigued early in the day. Fuzzy minded.    Going to take the dog for a walk. That's what a nonsmoker would do, right? And what a non-overeater would do. OK, I can do this.    After that, maybe I'll take a short nap. But then, I'm so afraid I'll oversleep and be late for work.   I'll set two alarm clocks.  Staying Quit takes some adjusting. My brain is weary from rethinking so that I don't fall into automatic actions, like going to the store to buy cigarettes, then falling wearily into a chair on the patio with coffee.    Sound familiar?
    You will get to know your new life. Have patience and drink deep from the cup of NOPE.
    Yep, sounds very familiair. It's something you have to find your way through. It won't last forever. Its a fase, it will pass. And then a different  fase wiI follow...  I did and still do lots of walking, to pass time and to stop my mind from racing on about smoking.         One month, nice! Well done. 
    It takes time  to adjust ....our junkie brain has to be unscrambled.... The more you do something ..the easier it gets ...the only way is to plough on...   This is why it's called a journey ...we meet new challenges along the way...and then suddenly ..it all get comfortable...   Well done on your first month ...that's a achievement...
    I agree with all above. And even though you're trying nt too, in these early months sweets do help with the fuzziness so try to drink some juice or have a candy. There's lots of low calorie sweets out there to help keep the weight off  
    OK.... peppermints are often sugar free.... or low cal.... and peppermints help with concentration, fatigue and focus... its why you should always have some in your center console for long drives... sucking peppermints help keep you alert.
    So Far so good for you,  get some Hard candys Sugar free OK, not sugar free still ok, put them where you would have normally had your cigarettes for me my shirt pocket.  When the urge to lite up Happens Reach in take one out and suck on it, Replace the smoke with a candy.    with a month under your belt your are running free, there will be very few hick ups in yoour Getty ups.    Enjoy, Take Pride and flaunt your month old nicotine free YOU !

Disturbing.     I know three people who vape and, not kidding, these people are loosing their soul ever since they started that sh*t. They treat that device like it's some precious jewel or something. They have become more nervous, less interested in the world around them. I talked to an acupuncturist, he said he's had an significant increase of customers, vapers, with anxiety problems.  I don't really read a lot about this, but my instinct tells me that this is bad. Edited January 15 by MLMR
Nicotine poisoning is a very real thing.    Symptoms of nicotine poisoning  Nicotine poisoning tends to occur in 2 stages.      Within the first 15 to 60 minutes following exposure, symptoms are related to the stimulatory effects of nicotine and include:      excess saliva in the mouth  feeling nauseous    stomach ache    vomiting    loss of appetite    dehydration eye irritation  headache    dizziness   tremors anxiety and restlessness    confusion   sweating    cough   rapid breathing increased heart rate    elevated blood pressure     Following this stage, the body begins to wind down. Nicotine's depressor effects appear within a few hours. These include:      low blood pressure  slow heart rate shallow breathing   diarrhea    fatigue weakness    pale skin       In extreme cases, symptoms include:     seizures    coma    breathing difficulties  respiratory failure Serious or fatal nicotine overdoses can occur.

    It is very disturbing that this vaping is taking such a hold on young people. Nicotine is nicotine no matter how you decide to use it. To kick the habit, I understand the short term use of patch or gum to get over the hump and hard times we all encounter but this is a whole different animal. It sort of reminds me when cigs first had filters. We would think this is not as bad as non-filter. BS as we know now. I hate government regulations but the vaping industry needs to do more to educate the young consumer or action should force them just as it did the cigarette industry. Same old turd, brand new toilet.
    I've been hearing commercials much more frequently where "real" people talk about how they made the "switch".  The masses are being led to believe they've quit smoking if they move to vaping.  It's disgusting that a deadly product can be advertised in that manner.
    You know I was concidering vaping as a alternative to smoking but I also wanted to be free of the Nicotine. Seems with the Vaping Industry you can't have nicotine free Vape ?  so on goes the adiction.   The people I know that vape keep ketting the stronger and stronger nicotine oils,    When will people see its the same fisherman (Tabaco industry ) they just changed the Hook and bait !
'a Journey'  is the philosophical way of looking at it. 'Shitty, empowering and highly challenging' is what I'd rather call it.         If there's one thing I know after 145 days of being smoke free, it's that I. WILL. NEVER. EVER. PUT. MYSELF.THROUGH. THIS. CRAP. EVER. AGAIN. Crystal clear motivation.         Quitting has had an effect on my relationships, my work, my daily rhytm, my everything. It's like I am reinventing myself, but not in a gradual, beautiful way. At some point the caterpillar seemed to evolve in something completely different than a colourful butterfly...      The dust is still settling. I've come to some pretty sad but strengthening conclusions: I am capable of mourning and going to a funeral of someone I hold dear and not smoke. I can find myself in the middle of relationship crisis and still stand my ground.  I found some consolation in staying true to myself, regarding my quit. I can deal with heavy panick attacks and remain without cigarettes . Anxiety seems to be diminishing by the way, but since that would be a glorious hallelujah and I am so afraid of disappointing myself with hope, for now I won't be focussing on that (but yeah. It is actually less of a daily base problem. Hoooly cow. Aaahhhhhh. Imagine if that pattern persists. I would get back part of my life).  I discovered that I'm pretty much through with my job but I have to endure untill I find something else. Realisation of missing out on proper grown-up education hits harder than ever, now that I'm unable to dull these thoughts. But there's a tiny glimpse of something new: 'if I can do this, I may be capable of so much more'. Shitting seven colours... but looking in to re-educating.     I am learning to dance my waltz with time. If quitting does one thing, it's messing with perspective. Since one month or so, I feel like I am regaining 3D view again. I am able to see depth once more and I am learning to be here now, without losing my horison.    Next week will mark five months for me. I have many reasons to continue like I do. But one thought is most empowering: it's all in my hands!Edited January 14 by MLMR

    That’s some mighty fine self reflection MLMR, very encouraging.  I, too,  used the agony of quitting as motivation to stay quit. Hell no I’m never going through that again!!!      Sound’s like you conquered some pretty big life stressors without smoking. That’s a big deal!       Carry on... 
    You are doing great, MLMR!

Hey you Guys !    The aventure continues,  6 days nicotine free  Edited January 14 by Opah
    Wow...here we go. My first huge test and crave since the beginning of this adventure. Just found out the company I work for is being sold. Tital waves right now. What’s b!tch.
    Oh wow, that is a biggie. Uncertainty at work does suck. What's the chat? Whats everyone saying? Fingers crossed for you. Zero point smoking, it will not help anything! Just stick around here if you are struggling. How are you feeling? 
    Oh man that is a biggie wantsit but you got this. You have two awesome months under your belt so try to think positive about it. It could end up being a good thing  
    Don't let anything compromise your quit.    Dig what @Cristóbal has to say,Your Quit -----Your Life The Proper Sequence.        One door closes, one door opens.    Hang tight to your resolve, you will win at everything.
    Wow!!!....What a bummer...hoping for a OK result....    As its been said ..Smoking won't change anything ....you will be more gutted ,if you gave away your fab quit ...    This is one thing you are in control of ...stay close ...shout out if you need help ...
    Oh my goodness Wansit.  I have the prayers going.  Don't stress what may not need stressing.  You have this quit so don't let go.  We are here for you.
    I feel for you, Wantsit.  I hope things work out for the best but, having been in that situation myself, I know it is stressful.        Please read the link that Sazerac posted by Cristobal (Your Quit and Your Life).  I often went to that thread when things were really stressing me and it helped keep my quit in the right perspective.     I hope all works out for the best but a cigarette will not make any situation better...only worse.
    I just want to begin this by saying thank you to all of that are out there supporting us that are liable to stumble. I had the perfect chance and excuse to fail but didn't , and who knows what will happen in the weeks to come but I haven't yet. I feel most of my strength has come from my support and knowledge that I have gotten from a few very good people here. THANK YOU! I have the utmost respect for all of you.
    Wansit, you are not going to stumble because you are strong.  No matter what circumstances life throws at us, it will not have to change our quit.  Life has many bumps in the road but we always navigate through them, and I have found that I always come out stronger on the other side.  Hang tough.  Don't let the uncertainty wobble your quit.  Shout out if you need us.
    I knew you would keep that great quit you have  Positive thoughts that everything at work ends up well 
Hi Wantsit.... glad you got through this without giving up your quit. Its a big shock when your stability wobbles. I was 4-5 months in when I found out my employer was closing. I had been there over 16 years... it was hard and for a while I had no job because I didn't look while they closed down so I could help them with the wind up.... but then I found a new job, I don't love it like my old job, yet, but they pay may a lot more than my old employer and I am finding my feet... I don't think it will ever feel like the old job did but it might ... what I learnt though was that I was worth way more than I thought .. lets just say I got over a 50% pay increase.... So financially I am much better off and yes it was scary and stressful and daunting but that old saying when one door closes another opens is true ... and while I still have my training wheels on ... going through that during my first year quit made my quit strong because it helped me to realise I was in control and I could do it despite hurdles.       I am so proud of you for not lighting up during this shock... hope all works out well on the job front.
Can we all come and work at your place jo? Think we'd all like a 50% pay rise       Good on you wantsit. You should be feeling really proud of yourself and more confident in your quit. That was a toughie and you didn't smoke

..."bright lines," a term that [George] Ainslie borrows from lawyers. These are clear, simple, unambiguous rules. You can't help but notice when you cross a bright line. If you promise yourself to drink or smoke "moderately," that's not a bright line. It's a fuzzy boundary with no obvious point at which you go from moderation to excess. Because the transition is so gradual and your mind is so adept at overlooking your own peccadilloes, you may fail to notice when you've gone too far. So you can't be sure you're always going to follow the rule to drink moderately. In contrast, zero tolerance is a bright line: total abstinence with no exceptions anytime. It's not practical for all self-control problems--a dieter cannot stop eating all food--but it works well in many situations. Once you're committed to following a bright-line rule, your present self can feel confident that your future self will observe it, too. And if you believe that the rule is sacred--a commandment from God, the unquestionable law of a higher power--then it becomes an especially bright line. You have more reason to expect your future self to respect it, and therefore your belief becomes a form of self-control: a self-fulfilling mandate. I think I won't, therefore I don't. (Baumeister and Tierney, 2011, pages 185-186.)      Baumeister, Roy F. and Tierney, John. Willpower: Rediscovering the greatest human strength. (2011). New York. The Penguin Press.        I feel more confident about saying "N.O.P.E." (never ever)--in addition to "not today," when I imagine a bright line into the future, separating my bright path from a dismal path that descends into darkness. That imagery and concept are helpful for me. Adding another coat of bright-paint to the line each day when I pledge to not smoke reinforces my willpower to stay on this light-filled side of the bright line.
    You are building a strong and sturdy quit, Kate, good on ya.     NOPE ~ Never/Ever/Forever
I got a bunch of sleep last night. I feel ok with myself today. i am nearly to day 5. only having two cups of coffee today. This has been a reallly long week for me. i feel almost normal today
    Love this post C... You sound so positive !!!.....high five !!!
Good for you Christine, and you're almost done with hell week!      A question: can you change your quit date to your new one and maybe put your old date in your signature or vise versus? I go by the quit date to give you the replies for where you are in your quit. I would hate to tell you, well at 7 months quit yadda yadda yadda......
    welcome to your new you !
    Glad your feeling better.
    Great job! 
Do tell about the post-one-year cravings...         I have definitely had cravings over the past year, but they've really died down.  I even had a month with none at all (I swear - it was month 10 or 11, I can't remember).  A few crept up during the last month, but now... I have cravings on a daily basis, and they are NOT the little passing nostalgic ones - they feel more physical.  Is this a thing?  I know it's all in my head, but why now?  It's not cool.  Is it because I came into this year with full-on confidence?  Am I losing my edge?
I had/have those too farmgirl, I think that just because we have a year, or almost three in my case, quit it still is nothing to the amount of years we smoked. So for a lot of us it's totally normal.     The beauty is that these craves are nothing like the bad craves we had in the beginning of our quits right? On New Year's eve I told my husband that I kinda felt like having a cigarette. Of course I didn't but it was a thought that popped in my head.  I figure that I smoked for 35 years so it may take years to get over all the craves
    Hey @farmgirl,  These craves are the last live embers of addiction as you put it to sleep.  Remember, Addiction doesn't magically go away, it is something we must live with forever.   The quicker we silence our smokey thoughts, the quieter the addiction becomes.      At a certain point after the first year,  I could no longer call my smokey thoughts craves, they were just wisps of a phantom.      You may find this post helpfulLifetime of Addiction  
G’day   A crave in week 1 of quiting is like stuffing a rat in a coffee can. You hold the lid down. As the oxygen level runs down that little rat/crave is in the fight for its life.   Youve got hold of the lid. Are you letting go....No away are you letting that little sh1t out...... all in all it’s pretty draining. Your fighting for you life too.    A craving at year one is like a wasp flying into you drink bottle.  “ where the hell did that come from?”   You’re not that stupid to think you can just release it. You know how dangerous that would be. Without another thought you screw the lid down and chuck it in the bin.  Problem? What problem! it’s solved  C

I was talking to a fella just recently who relapsed after 24 years - can you believe that - 9 years later he is still smoking and is fighting the battle to try and quit again.
It's not unusual.  I still remember cravings hitting me periodically, but in waves, after a year.  At airports of all places.  The big picture is that the cravings will continue to grow weaker and less frequent.         However this might be a good time to review the reasons you quit to begin with.  Write the reasons down on a piece of paper and keep the list with you at all times. Revisit the Newbie Package and Joel's pages, and read and remember.  Revisit any practices that helped you early on. Your resolve will become even stronger and the cravings will continue to weaken and become less frequent.     Hang in there!! You've beat this thing and all you need to do is remain vigilant!Edited January 12 by JOD
    Here are some resources from our friend, Joel,Craves or thoughts that occur over time.
Hello, this is my first time posting. I am 33 years old and came down with the flu a few weeks ago, which lead to pneumonia. 10 days after I was diagnosed with pneumonia I was hospitalized for 3 days due to low blood oxygen levels. I was released from hospital last Monday  (2 nights ago). During my sickness I did not smoke. It was a struggle to breathe and I had no desire to smoke. I told myself I would never smoke again because I made it this far. Also, after getting a glimpse of what living with lung disease is like, I wanted to quit before I developed a more long-term lung disease. Well since getting out of hospital I have really been struggling. I am so emotional. Partly because I missed out on so much over the Christmas break due to my illness, and Christmas is my favourite time of the year. Partly because not smoking makes me sad. I don't even fully understand why I am so sad, but I have been crying a lot. I work from home so I am all alone during the day, and being back to my normal routine makes me feel like I am missing out by not taking my smoke breaks. I know it sounds silly, but I feel very deprived. Anyways, today I broke down and found my pack of cigarettes that I gave to my non-smoking husband (they were in his sock drawer) and smoked three. My lungs are still recovering, it was so stupid. Now I'm even more emotional. I don't want to be a smoker, but I love smoking. Sorry for the rambling. just feeling very emotional and thought I'd try reaching out to others who might understand what I am going through.    I should also add, I was a pack-a-day smoker from 14 yrs - 27 yrs. I quit for 2 years, using the patch for 3 months, when my husband and I decided to try for a baby. We got pregnant with twins. I stupidly started again around their first birthday. At first it was just a couple of smokes a day with my coffee during their nap, but it slowly turned into a half-a-pack-a-day habit. Now I want to quit even more for them, so I can be around as long as possible, be healthy for them, and set a good example. Nevertheless, the cravings are so strong.
    It sounds like your experience at Christmas was pretty scary and you need to keep that in mind as motivation to quit for good. Education about this addiction is key so please read all you can here and watch some of the Joel video's that may address some of your questions and concerns. The support you will receive here is amazing and comes fro others who are in the process or have already quit successfully so .... we get it! We understand what you are going through. The mental process of quitting is what takes the most effort and time and that's why you feel lost or like you're missing something right now. You need time to retrain your brain to be comfortable as a non smoker again. It takes time. No short cuts unfortunately.   Others will be along to give you some tips and advice too. It's a great place to keep in touch with if you are serious about quitting    Welcome aboard CanadianProud  
    Welcome Canadianproud, quitting smoking is an emotional roller-coaster the first few weeks/months. Some cry, some get angry. It's all normal and something we have to go through when we quit. First thing you must do though is throw out the cigarettes. If you don't have any than there are none to find right? Next you need to continue to take your breaks, just do something else instead of smoking. Or if worse comes to worse, smoke an air cigarette. I used mine for months. It's simply pretending you're holding a cigarette and then going through the motions of "smoking" it. Some have used cut straws, pens etc. It works great at tricking your mind into thinking it's getting the real thing.    I loved smoking too until my lungs got so damaged that I decided liked breathing more.  Congratulations on your twins, I'm a twin, and just think of how cool it will be that they will never know their mom was a smoker as long as you quit now. You can do it. Stick close to the board. I was glued to it my whole first year. Lot's to do to keep you occupied and educated on this addiction  
Hi Canadian proud, welcome and love the name btw  I used the patches early in my quit. Looks like you had a decent quit on them....could you maybe go back on them? Might be just what you need to get through the difficult first few weeks. I'd get down to the pharmacy asap!!   You've come to the right place for help and support. You have brilliant reason to quit - being healthy and living long for your twins. You don't want to be a stinky mum, missing out on so much because of smoking! I quit as a young mum I know under 40 got diagnosed with lung cancer and she subsequently died. Quit now!!! That is the harsh reality but when you stop ignoring that...quitting is much easier.
    Hello Canadian Proud, Welcome to the Train.  The first few weeks can be hard, and I also felt low and very tired. I went to bed early and napped as much as possible. I found listening to sleep relaxation music helped me to de stress and go with the flow.  Watching Joel Spitzer Videos also helped me a lot. Pamper yourself, treat yourself, and allow yourself to eat what you want in the first few weeks, dont worry about weight gain, you can tackle that later when you are stronger. It will be the best thing you can do for yourself and your babies.   All the best and take care 
Welcome CP... So emotionally I didn't handle things too well on previous quits...partly it was not knowing about quitting affecting your blood sugar levels .. partly it's because smoking for me was very linked to my emotions. I knew that going in this time so I knew form me the important thing was to break the habit/ritual first. I needed to reprogram how I took breaks and rewarded myself and coped with stress...I had to reprogram all that stuff before dealing with the physical... I used NRT gum... Gave myself up to 6 months on it and i needed much less... Doesn't mean I still wasn't emotional..but it took the edge off to let me work on the harder part for me.    Now Christmas I hear you... So down under in the wonderful land of Aus we do Christmas in July....basically because Chrissy time here is summer we miss out (or don't enjoy as much) tradition hot Christmas stuff. So Chrissy day is usually in the 30s Celsius...so in July we do Christmas dinner like you Noryhies and wear our jumpers... You could have a Christmas in July...and do Aussie Christmas foods...cold seafood platters, salads, cold game off the bone...cold roast chook..trifle..pavlova...jelly cups and fairy bread.....backyard cricket or would it be lacrosse for you lot or baseball.. Just so you have something to look forward to before next Chrissy...for 1 week you get to play the Chrissy carols and they don't send you mental...trust me 36c and songs about let it snow have wierd psychological effects.
    CP      You have so many reasons to quit.  You just need to learn that smoking is not a reward or pleasure or relaxer.  It's a cold-blooded killer.  And there are no valid excuses to justify smoking.  Like missing Christmas, or feeling that your smoke breaks are your special time.  Phooey!      Time to take this bull by the horns and slam it to the ground.  Fortunately, there's lot's of information right here on this forum to help you get through this.  It still won't be a walk in the park (at least for the first few months).  But watching videos, reading how other's coped with similar situations, and offering your help to fellow quitters will make this a much more achievable goal.  It's worth the effort.  You're worth it!
Welcome aboard, CP!         Life without cigarettes is a great thing.  I'm sorry to hear that you relapsed after 2 years but I hope you saw that life was better then without having to plan you life around when you could get your nicotine fix.  You just simply have to commit to never taking another puff and leaving those cigarettes behind you for good.       Read up on this site about nicotine addiction.  This education can really help you stay quit for good.  Keep reaching out if you need help.     It is good to have you here.  You can do this!
    OK, bebe.,  It is time to quit, right ? The answer to this is YES, It IS TIME TO QUIT.  So, know that You can quit.     I quit, all these lovely people quit.   It is not rocket science.       It is about making a commitment to yourself.        Embrace the new day, quit nicotine and be a free person.    You can do this.    Prepare yourself with education about nicotine addiction    and hold on for the ride.   You won't regret a thing.   Love,   S
Hi Canadian Proud.  You have found the right place for the support and help to guide you through the quit journey.  I smoked for 42 years and attempted many quits without success. Once I found this forum, it was almost as if they took my hands and guided me through.  I love the power I feel and my self esteem is through the roof knowing that I am not anchored to such a filthy habit.  How blessed you are to have twins and you are going to want to be there for every magical moment in their lives.  So please join us.  We are here for you!
Welcome aboard .... Time to dust down ...and get the job of quitting done ,your lungs will be ever so grateful...   I smoked 52 years...it's doable ...you just need to want it bad enough....  Those two lovely babes is a very good reason ...    Make the decision to never stick anything in your mouth ,and set fire to it ...ever....no matter what is happening in your life ... My hubby has end stage Emphysema....This is one illness you want to avoid at all costs .... Stay close ...
All I want to (or feel that I can) add at this point is that, in 2001, I "lost" (the more appropriate phrase is "gave up") a quit of about 21 days.  Somehow, I was able to marshal the energy to  begin again.  And seventeen-plus years later, my life has been transformed and literally saved by beginning again.       All the best, and we know you can do it--       Christian99 17+ years quit
    Nope
Hi      The best time to quit was 20 years ago the second best time to quit is now.     Do it now if only for your children.
Nope going on 7 years - celebrate every single nope - they add up quickly!!
Posted 30 March 2015 - 09:14 AM Quitting smoking leaves us with a terrible emptiness that, for a while, we don't know exactly how to handle. And we may even ask ourselves if we will ever be able to fill these voids with anything. What helped me to get over this was eventually understanding that the source of the problem wasn't the absence of cigarettes, but the mere existence of those terrible feelings I was dealing with.       They were there all along, but I was trying to cover them all up with smoke... The moment I stopped smoking, I started to realize and acknowledge all those things that were wrong in my life and I've been trying to get rid of by hiding behind a curtain of cigarette smoke. But they didn't disappear, they have been watching me silently and now, as the smoke cleared, we are starting to make eye contact again. Should I light a cigarette so I become blind again? Or should I finally tackle the beasts? The answer is clear. I will attack.     So ask yourself, as you are ripped by this feeling of emptiness: is it ok that a small piece of paper filled with tobacco has become such an important part of my life? Is it ok that I have become emotionally attached to a small piece of paper filled with tobacco?!        Don't hide behind the curtain of smoke again. Don't choose to run again. Make the most of the fact that you are finally capable to see your life as it really is and you finally have the chance to fill those voids. Fill your short and precious life with people, places, hobbies and knowledge. Put things that actually matter inside those voids, because blowing smoke inside them will never, ever, make them disappear.
    This is right whete i am at. Thx.
    Here here Jillar. Well said.

I'm not sure if there are others out there who believe that smoking and lying go hand-in-hand, but I found myself lying to people throughout my life about whether I smoked, how much I smoked, and if it was effecting my health.  This is a post I wrote a few years ago.     Most of us smokers began our years or decades of addiction back when we were teens.  We learned to lie about smoking right from the very beginning.  Usually it started with our parents asking why we smelled like a rancid ashtray.  “Oh, I was at Johnny Picklefork’s house and his mom smokes like a chimney” I nervously responded.  “That Bertha Picklefork really needs to cut back” my mom would chuckle.       A few months later my mother met me at the door with a pack of reds in her hand as I returned from school.  “Young man, what was this doing in your sock drawer?” I let out a small sigh of relief knowing that it was only the cigarettes that she found. “Um, Tammy Tamblanadana’s brother was grounded for smoking so Tammy asked if I could hold on to them for a few days”.        Sometime later my dad drove by me holding a cigarette in my hand while hanging out with the neighborhood kids. When asked about this at dinner, I effortlessly told him, “I was just holding it for Jin Dong while she tied her shoe”.      Once it was second nature to lie to my parents about smoking, it became just as easy to lie to myself about it.     I can quit any time I want.         I just do it to calm myself down.           It relaxes me.          It’s just a habit.          The list could go on forever.  It kept me in the cycle of addiction for decades until one day I called it out for what it was:  Pure Bulls&@t!      Not only are the health benefits endless when you quit, but it’s incredibly liberating to stop lying to yourself and others.     P.S.  The names in this story have been changed to protect the innocent.
Great post BKP...   I was 11 years old ...I lied for years ...to my parents....it was that long ago now ...I carnt remember them...I smoked then for 52 years ...   At that age you dont expect to be a smoker all your adult life ...if someone had told me that at 11 ,I would have thought they were barmy....   Like you my friend the biggest lie was telling myself ,it was my reward ....I enjoyed it ...I could stop when ever I wanted ... All Lies...killing myself slowly ,is not a reward ....I didn't enjoy it ...I was hooked ...a addict... I can quit anytime I want .....I prooved that lie,with my million attempts to quit and fail...
Very few smokers gave you that answer, i just dont care. There is a cycle with addicts. With serious drugs or other issues they will go way passed the lying and manipulate you to feeling sorry for them.      55 minutes ago, BKP said:               The list could go on forever.  It kept me in the cycle of addiction for decades until one day I called it out for what ﻿it was:  Pure Bulls&@t!     https://www.narconon.org/blog/drug-addiction/vicious-cycle-addiction/
I was raised in a very strict upbringing.  I would have never gone against my parents.  I graduated high school on a Friday and started my first secretarial job the following Monday.  I felt so free and like an adult.  I remember my first pack.  I sat and smoked it at lunch break thinking I was so cool looking and finally a free adult.  That was at age 18.  It did not take long for the rosy glow to fade.  I married at 21 and had my first child at 22.  I could not stop.  I smoked through both my pregnancies and had low birth weights and two miscarriages.   I was so ashamed, I would only smoke at home and not in public.  I lied to everyone.  I would even lie to my doctor, who probably knew.  My friends would often say I smelled like smoke but I would say they are crazy.      I think one of the reasons we feel so empowered after quitting is because we can finally be true to ourselves and everyone else.     Edited January 10 by Linda Thomas
    Nice post LT 
I was always out of the closet with smoking,    didn't lie about it, didn't care.   I 'LOVED' smoking. I smoked everywhere. Smoking and I were like white on rice, inseparable for 40 something years.  I didn't trouble myself about it.   Quit while pregnant, resumed after the birth.       Then, a bit over five years ago, it dawned on me that I was just like a junkie. I hated junkies,    (even threw Tim Hardin out of my house for shooting up in my bathroom). I knew nothing about addiction.     I quit on a whim and lurked here and there,     immersing myself in an education about nicotine and nicotine addiction.     With information,  I understood the lies, the lies and the denial.  It strengthened my resolve. I

    The first couple days i had a lot of trouble sleeping, but it's been better tha past two days. But i am still having a weird sense that time is off. it doesn't feel like morning, for instance. is this normal for quitting?
    I think it's normal for winter, quitting or not lol. But there is a lot of brain fog in the early weeks of quitting so this could be why you're feeling that way too....
All normal C ...    Our bodies are all over the place ....glad your sleeping ...I never slept for weeks....was on the board 24/7.....keep going ...
You might want to go through Joel's Video Index you will learn a lot of things about nicotine addiction and be able to put yourself at ease knowing what happens or, what can happen.   Here is one I found for youDisorientation That May Occur When Quitting SmokingEdited January 11 by Sazerac
    In one hour, it will be three days of this quit. Trying to make this one forever. I slept a bit better last night. need to cut down on coffee and snacks
Good for you getting through day 3 C12! Remember, focus just on today and for today alone you won't smoke  Don't take on too much in the early days of your quit. Remember, rewards are important for getting through the day as a non-smoker. If that happen's to be snacking, so be it. It you gain a little weight, you can address that later once your quit is secure. For the coffee - yeah, try to replace that with something else if you can. Maybe a decaf coffee or, fruit juice would be a great substitute too. Keep going Christine
    You're doing great so far Christine, I agree with reci don't worry about the snacking or coffee right now. Focus on one thing at a time  
Day 3 will become Day 4 and will be another day to celebrate.  Daily victories add up.  Keep it going!!!
    Great job christine!      
    Each day is a great accomplishment and congratulations on your three days of Freedom.   Your body begins to repair and you settle in and get stronger every day.    Since you mentioned caffeine, you might find this vid from our friend, Joel, interesting.    
    Hey girl you are a day ahead of me and  Doing great, Yes it is still up hill but you have a Full head of Steam and are rolling strong !
    Here we go after getting my hindny kicked, I am back,   Lets Do it !     
    You should get plenty of help support opah! Not many new quitters yet on the year.... Get-em rock!                   
    This is your year Opah, you can succeed  
    You know the drill.  You know what to expect.  You know it can be terrible the first days or weeks.  We know you want this. Hunker down & get ‘er done this time. I know you can!!!! 
Getting long in the Day, it feels like the air in my lungs is heavy.  Been nidling on some tangerine slice and my Ricola drops. I am good and not in danger of smoking, I cant smoke what I don't have.  But really getting the urge crawl into bed and pull the blankets over my head and peek out at the TV.  Home is safe, never smoked in side and very seldom outside it is and has been my NO SMOKING ZONE.   2.5 hours I'll be on my way.   until then Deep breathes and two, three or so ricolas.    I need some wethermans hard carmel drops.
    OK its minutes now, Carl is in and just for a second I thought smoke break, hopefully I will help Carl in his quest for a smoke free life.  But for now its all about me me  ME, this is all my time at least for three weeks.  So Thank you all for your support today, and I will see you tomorrow.    
    Excellent news, Opah! Get some beauty sleep.    You are doing great, congratulations on your second day.    Tomorrow is another day to be free.
    G,day   well your back... good stuff.   Wish I could distill what makes a quit  a final one. I should,I’ve (lost) (had) a few.  Get yourself free of the smokes then work on if you think your a smoker or an addict.   chris        
Thank you Chris and Good day to you !  3rd day started and felling better on the drive into work.  Time for some coffe. I have work waiting so it will be a busy good morning for my quit
I anticipated the forum to be flooded with newbies.  I applaud those that have reclaimed their lives and health- vowing to kick the addiction in the 'butt' in 2019.  I'm standing here in peddle pushers/capris/waders- waiting for the tide to roll in with a mass of new quitters.  I'm taking the sunshine route- less smokers in the world these days (hallelujah!) so fewer folks will quit; therefore, less activity on forums like QT.          Are you still smoking?  You're a smoker.        Want to quit this year?  You're a wannabe.      Stop smoking cigarettes right now.  You will become an ex/former smoker-one of the greatest titles ever! Edited January 11 by Lust4Life

I’d rather get people off crack,” Dr. Louis De Palo, Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Moneyish. “The recidivism rate is huge because it’s not just the nicotine. If you really want to be successful, you have to look at everything that one stick is giving you, which is why a combination of nicotine replacement and cognitive behavioral therapy has shown the most success.” Medication plus counseling doubles a smoker’s chance of quitting, according to U.S. Public Health Services        “Smoking is not a ‘bad habit’ — smoking is an addiction, and this is how it has to be treated,” said Cindy Mendoza, health educator and tobacco specialist at Montefiore Medical Center.            Smoking costs you more than $27,000 a year. Here’s your no B.S. guide to quitting for good. By Nicole Lyn Pesce
    Brrrr. Feeling chilled and it's after dinner. The combination makes me want to bundle up and go outside to smoke. Also have a headache, which is rare for me. Increases desire to smoke.    It's strong, so I'm resorting to my tactic of brushing my teeth, taking the dog for her poop-walk, and going to sleep.  Brrrrrrrrrr. Craaaavvvve.   Feeling chilled a trigger for anyone else?
    Hi Kate, isn't it weird what triggers a crave? I got my worse craves when I was super happy about something or my asthma was acting up!     You're doing so great and that weird crave gets weaker and weaker the more you get past it. Soon it will be just a fleeting thought that goes as quickly as it comes 
The cold never brought on a crave for me but some triggers for cravings to light up are individually unique and others are pretty commonly shared. There are so many things our brain associated with smoking that it really does take a while to experience them all and get through those situations. That's why they say you need to get through all 4 seasons to experience all your triggers. Keep going. You're doing great and almost at 1 whole month! That's fantastic
Kate,   Craves will continue to pop up especially the first year.   Many are seasonally related (Winter chill, the burst of Spring etc.).   These are the receptors in your brain that have made associations with Nicotine.    Do not fear any crave, all you have to do is breathe through it.    As someone said, as we all repeat, "A Crave Is Not A Command".  It is just another receptor to wrench away from Nicotine    and look how splendid you are doing !   an hour from 28 days ?  Beautiful !Edited January 9 by Sazerac
    It is strange , the things that bring on craves. For me one is staying in Hotels. I know it sounds strange since you cannot smoke in most of them , but we've stayed in two the last month and a half and after we get settled in and pour a drink I really would like to go out and have one. It passes quickly but it's been about the only time I really have a stronger crave. This scares me as well because we are going on another cruise in April and I told my wife last night that has me worried even though I haven't really struggled much lately. There is something about setting there with a drink in your hand , soaking in the sun , listening to the Caribbean music and looking out across the Ocean while enjoying a smoke.  She said she would hurt me if that happened...promises, promises , I told her. But seriously, that has me more concerned  than any time since I've quit.  I'll make it through but just thinking ahead.
@Wantsit by the time your cruise comes you'll have three more months quit under your belt and you'll probably be pleasantly surprised at what a difference those months make. Most have found that the anticipation was way worse than the actual event that led to it. You're doing so well that I have a feeling you'll be just fine come April. And if you do find yourself craving just remember the air cigarette, the cleanest cigarette you'll ever "smoke". Edited January 10 by jillar

Start to think about all the improvements to your "fun time" when you get to that cruise next April  You won't have to pack a carton of smokes and worry about having an extra lighter as a back up just in case. You won't be pushing your wife aside trying to get out the airport doors for that much needed smoke when you arrive at your cruise port by air. You won't have to huddle in that "smokers area" on the ship's deck and feed your addiction. Huddled there with so many other addicts all puffing away while non-smokers stroll by and casually look over at the poor addicted fools. No more travelling half the ship to get up to that smoker's place on deck first thing in the morning while others run the jogging path around you, getting their morning fix or oxygen and exercise.      Oh, sorry for blathering on and on about all the benefits you'll enjoy as a non smoker on your cruise in April. Now, what was it that you thought you might be missing out on?Wantsit. You'll be just fine with all this by April. Just wanted to give you some things to focus on up till then. Yes. your mind will think about the old smoker you facing a new non smoking environment for the first time but you may just be surprised at how your quit strengthens, rather than weakens, when you go on that Caribbean Cruise. In fact; I'm so convinced of this I'm going to prove it to you. I'm going to go on a Caribbean Cruise for you and report back later on how it went  If I'm gone for then next while, you'll know where I'm at.

They walk through there with their noses in the air and fanning their hands acting as though they are going to pass out. It makes you want to say...GO AROUND! LOL! This year I will get to set with all the stuck up people on the other side. Did you ever notice that? The nonsmokers always seemed  a little snootier on the other side of the ship. Maybe spending time over there will lift me up to their level! After all...I am a non smoker right now.   Thank you for shedding a different light on this for me!
    You know what I found was that Yes, I would pass by the "smoker's corner" and look at them but all I felt was pity for them and happiness for myself not to have to be stuck there with them any longer hiding away while I got my fix. As a former smoker and now a non smoker, you will have a unique perspective on this. You won't be sticking up your nose at them because you understand way more that the never-smokers do about just what these people are up against.
    You're right recip-I'm not that type of person and wouldn't act that way to begin with. And I do like you said , know what it's like and do not want to be there. I am finding this out with my wife. After all these years of being together this is separating us at times . I do feel sorry for them because it just plain sucks. 
    Well, when I smoked, my wife had already quit long ago and when we went on a cruise, I just wandered off every now and again to get my fix. Didn't bother either one of us although, it should have bothered me that she had quit years ago and I didn't until recently. Now, I still wander off ..... just not to the smoking place 
    i mean to quit this time        how long does it take before i can start feeling normal again?
            To be honest, christine,    this is a journey of self-discovery, a boost of self-confidence and learning how to be a smoke free person. The physical withdrawals can last for months to include the great smoke free fog,   the rest is un learning and understanding the pattern of addiction.     Each receptor in your brain needs to be re-booted.  Give it a year, give it the rest of your life.  It won't be as crazy as it is now, you are in the thick of it   and it gets better with each crave you beat.    Each moment, day, each week, each month, each year brings more and more benefits for you to enjoy.      Hang on to your resolve and educate yourself, read till your eyes bleed.    You are doing the best work on the planet,  putting your addiction to sleep !       Congratulations on you second day of Freedom.   Tomorrow,  a whole lot of nicotine will have left your body and you are growing new cilia in your lungs as we speak.
    You can make it as hard or as easy as you choose to do. For me it was hard and took months but for others it was just a matter of they quit smoking and were done. But it does seem that the younger, more active quitters had an easier time of it.
    Regarding how long it takes to feel normal again, it varies for everyone.       Still, life as a smoker is not a normal life.  Our bodies were not created to inhale all of these deadly chemicals.  Try to think of it less as trying to feel normal and realize that you are in the process of healing yourself from the damage of smoking.       Don't light up again and things will get better with time.      I'm glad you are quitting again.
Congratulations on day 2 christine.  That's a big deal.         I would like to suggest that you don't focus so much on when you'll feel "normal" again, but that would make me a hypocrite.  I used to ask a friend at work every day when I would stop feeling so obsessed and deprived.  He kept giving me vague answers such as "It doesn't just happen overnight.  It will just evolve into better days".  I'd storm off, bemoaning the fact that he didn't give me a specific date.       But he was right.  It just takes time.  And there's no point in fixating on the magical date.  Focus more on the good you're doing for your body, mind, wallet, friends and family, etc.        P.S.  If you must have a target date, shoot for day 3 and get back to me tomorrow.
    One day at a time Christine. Don;t look beyond today in terms of your quit. Days will turn into weeks and weeks to months and you will gradually start feeling better and better about your new non smoking life. 
    As said above Christine this is a journey and you must take it one day at time, do not look beyond today -- keep that focus and you can get thru this.  As to normal, do not look at that, look at as each day an improvement over your days as a smoker!!!!
    Can only agree with all the above posts.... It doesn't really matter how long....its just about getting there....our brains can sometimes be our worst enemies...   Your a non smoker now...it's all about staying that way....this is done by taking it one day at a time....feel proud ....
Christine, it depends on what you think normal is.  Life is full of abnormal days.  Even finally succeeding in the quit, I don't feel normal.  I do feel, now that I can trudge through my abnormal life and not have to rely on smoking.  I am 5 mos. quit and I do still crave but I feel more in control and really empowered to see my quit through.    You are in the tough week.  I promise you will feel better as time goes on.
As some of you may know, we recently lost our two senior Corgis within a month of each other. As devastating as that was, I never once even thought about smoking.      Well, we decided our house was a bit too quiet, so say hello to Cooper.     While she is the most adorable thing I've ever seen, I've never been driven want to smoke (or drink) until we got her.

Why is quitting So hard by jwg » Wed Aug 29, 2012 4:01 pm   So that is the question , why is quitting so hard ? I think there is only one reason quitting it so hard to do  Or maybe two reasons , at most three to five ,, less then ten for sure..    Sadly I don’t think most here will agree with me nor will they aperciate my opion , and that really all this. My opion .    A view from my porch and from my experiences , nothing more So there that’s the warning , take it with a grain of salt  The reasons quitting is hard to do  First off its hard because ,, You want it to be! And yes I think that is true most people want quitting to be the hardest thing thay have ever done in there life,,,WHY ?   So they can then justify in there mind why on earth they smoked for so long,, after all if quitting was “easy” they would feel like quite the heal for not quitting years ago.  So in order to live with them self in a balance of peace , quitting must then be difficult. Plus with quitting being so hard to do, it gives the quitter a boost in there personal moral on how “hard” they fought and won ..   The quitter wants quitting to be hard to do , so they do not have to    Accept loved ones could have prevented there suffering and death if they could have easily quit.    And then there is the aspect of quitting is “so hard to do” because they have been told it was for years , and like the sentence above , have even been to the funerals that proved this to be true.    If you want to quit smoking and fit in with others who quit smoking , then by god you have to suffer threw it just like they did too. After all no one gets a free pass when it comes to quitting smoking ,,    “The hardest thing in the world to do”  Well to each there own , but it all honesty . to stop smoking is not that hard to do it at all , In fact NO ONE that ever really wanted to Quit Smoking has ever failed..   To stop smoking dose not cause pain , where as healing from most other things in fact dose , A sun burn carries with it much greater pain then any one ever suffered to stop smoking.   Mentally, a spelling test is harder then it is to quit smoking ..   And lastly, why quitting is so hard to do ? , because before most ever start they go into already granting them selfs permission to fail. And then this failure only dose one thing , grants them permission once more ,    So this goes back to my point , quitting is only hard because most just want it that way.   But I know first hand , that dose not have to be the way it is and in fact if focused on the rewards vs the discomforts , quitting hands down is the easiest thing any one has ever done for them selfs If smoking is a temp pleasure with long term consequences   Then to stop is is temp discomfort with long term benefits  Break the cycle , evaluate your quit honestly with out the desire for it to be “so hard” and not only will you see it is not as you have been lead to believe , but too you will learn to enjoy the process of becoming free to do all the things you once sat around and labeled   “one of these days” `jwg`
    Thanks @jillar for keeping these wise words and sharing them.. Perfect timing to for some of us too.
    Respect to jwg....but I disagree with some of this post.  Quitting was HARD for me.  Despite knowing all the slogans        It's only as hard as you make it out to be          It's temporary...you'll get over it in a few minutes            You need to focus on the positive and not dwell on the negative         Etc, etc.       My gut was in a knot for the first several months.  My brain was unable to focus.  It really was the hardest thing I've ever done (and I've been through some pretty serious sh/t).     But regardless of that, when things got really tough, I was able to keep going on sheer determination.      I want any newbie who's feeling distress to know that not everyone can dismiss the discomfort simply by thinking it's not hard or adopting a new mindset.  You can do it in spite of it being hard.     So, whether it's hard or easy, the bottom line is it's doable.  Just because something is difficult doesn't mean you shouldn't do it or it's not worth fighting for.  Eventually the hardships diminish.  One day the thought of "Quitting was hard" will be replaced with "Quitting was smart".

Grit your teeth and power though those times and they will diminish in time and become less frequent and you'll find yourself in such a much batter place   Now go camping like you said! Which place are you camping at? Hilton, Best Western? Hampton Inn's not bad too

Sorry to hear you are having so much trouble quitting C12  Are you drinking lots of water and fruit juice to help blood sugar levels? Those may help with the sleep disorder but, sleep pattern interruption is pretty common for many while quitting.   Are you quitting cold turkey or are you using NRT products?     Reading all you can about nicotine addiction to understand how it affects your brain and your body is crucial to forming a long lasting quit. There's a ton of Joel videos here too that will address specific situations that may be of interest to you.

    Sorry you lost your quit again Christine. I stayed glued to the forum for my whole first year. I found reading, supporting, celebrating and socializing really helped keep my mind off my misery. You also should be posting an SOS whenever you feel yourself caving to a crave. I did and my quit was saved at least twice. No shame in doing it if it means your forever quit right?!

I failed and failed until i had the right mindset... Don't quit quitting...  https://whyquit.com/pr/111909.html
Hi C 12,  it is good that you are posting.  We know you truly want to quit.  I think if you can just get yourself through the first week, the craves are much more manageable.  Like Reciprocity said, you might try NRT or talk with your doctor.  I also found it helpful to stay close to the forum and read everything you can.  We are here to help guide you through this, just shout out!
Don't forget about the SOS page either please! This is a life saver in the early days if things become overwhelming. Just post up and peeps will come running to talk you off the ledge (so to speak)  Edited January 8 by reciprocity

    Hello Christine,    I am a cold turkey success story.   It was easier for me to just DO IT  rather than deal with NRTs. You must embrace the suck no matter what method you choose to quit, it is a serious deadly addiction and the only real choice is to     NEVER SMOKE AGAIN.  Sure, you will have discomfort but, so what....the rewards far outweigh any distress.   Please educate yourself,    commit to yourself and protect your quit.   You Will Succeed.
Repeat what the chick above said.       I grabbed the word NOPE. I said it 100000 times a day. If I never took a puff I couldn't fail.      also like A puff away from a pack a day.        keep Marching
Sometimesit takes every last bit of you to keep your balanceand not do something self destructive.I'm not talking about willpower, I'm talking aboutsomething else.I'm not sure how to describe it.It's like the part of you that wants to live,the part of you that is committed to not smoking,is connected by only the most slender of threads tothe part of you driving the car,making the decisions. Sometimes you just hang in there,a minute at a time. You ask for help, but you knowif you choose toyou can turn away from that pretty easily,or even accidentallyon purpose. Sometimesnot sliding backwardscounts as moving forwards.Sometimes not actively trying to die isliving large.Sometimes holding your groundis a fragile miracle.
Very well said Julie! 

Beautiful Julie
This is so true.
Wonderful, thoughtful post, Julie!

YES! We have a few around here now so stay with us Newbies! Take things a day at a time and stay true to that commitment you made to yourself not too long ago. It will happen if you just don't smoke - not even one puff is the road to freedom. Stay active here because as the days turn into weeks, you will need people who truly understand what you are going though. Those people will underpin your quit foundation for you as you continue to build your permanent quit.Edited January 8 by reciprocity

    Freedom !!! That Sense of shame....noticing how some folks looked at me...when I was standing in a door way ...to get my fix ....   What does it mean to you ?????
    I had the same shame Doreen.  I hid my smoking.  Once I quit working, I just stayed home.  I am free now to go out and live my life!
Self respect... I didn't think much of myself before I quit... and while I'm still a work in progress I certainly have way more respect for who I am now than I did this time 13 moths ago.
    Strength ...I feel more stronger now in every aspect of my life ....I can cope better ...more calmer ....
    Not worrying about running out of cigarettes!
    Freedom from being a smoker in front of my daughter. 
    So many things!! Stronger, smarter, healthier, freer(more free),calmer,more productive, more focused, less distracted.......
    No longer tethered to the tobacco industry, fine fellows that they are (not).
    Cigarettes were going to kill me.  If I could get free, I might live.  
    At first I thought quitting was about a healthier lifestyle and saving money but now, a year later; it's being rid of all the BS that goes along with the actual act of smoking that I am happiest to be rid of. Being able to control my own life and not having to run my life in accordance to a nicotine addiction's demands.
    My confidence has soared since I quit smoking.  I have control of my life once again.  It still amazes me how much effort I put into smoking.  My entire day was wrapped around when I would smoke.  I craved my next cigarette before I had even put out the one I was currently smoking.  I mistakenly believed quitting was too difficult.  It wasn't too difficult. Smoking was difficult.  I am so thankful for the life I have now and I would not trade this freedom for anything.  
    Yes, smoking truly is difficult! Very much so   ..the planning. covering the stench....breath, hair, clothes,  truck etc        So much time wasted, so many things missed....the LIE !!
    Not worrying if the next one ,would start cancer....the fear has gone ....
    No more huddling under a tree, trying to keep from getting rained on and trying to keep rain from drowning my cigarette.    (I only smoked outdoors)    No more looking at my month-end budget and expenses, and how smoking was keeping me from saving money.      It's also giving my willpower a workout. Saying "no" hundreds of times to urges to smoke; saying "yes" to exercise and meditation.   
    I had shame too, Doreen.  Now, I live life without pause.  Sure, I need a break. A mental break not a smoke break. I confused the two for many years.       I shamed myself into quitting after having a family vacation at a popular theme park. I missed too much because of the addiction.       So, I quit.  For that & many other reasons.          
    In all honesty,  at this point freedom still means hard work! If not debunking addict thoughts, it's accepting where I'm at... exercizing radical patience.... believing that whatever comes my way, I'll be in good shape to handle it without burning something so I can inhale the smoke...      On the bright side, I believe that these are all qualities that I'll benefit from for the rest of my life! 
    G﻿’day﻿ ﻿﻿  well it﻿ t﻿hat time of the day, time to think about smoking....     NOPE ﻿﻿ thats it, all done, ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿till to﻿morr﻿ow m﻿orning   C﻿﻿﻿﻿
Freedom, for me, has been so surprisingly generative.  During my quitting process, I developed skills that continue to help me when I face difficult circumstances, and frankly I never would have predicted that I would continue to reap the (non-physical) benefits so long after I was able to extinguish the associations and cravings related to smoking.         Christian99 17 Years Quit

    A new benefit I just realized today.  My skin is not as dried out.   I used to get those painful skin cracks on the tips of my fingers, especially in the winter months, but this morning I realized I hadn’t had one since I quit smoking
    Here is a vid from our friend, Joel, about 'how to do nothing w/out a smoke.                This part of quitting was hard for me.  In-between tasks or taking breaks I would usually sit on my back stoop and  think about what to do next or just look at my garden...that light on that leaf.    I thought I needed a smoke to do this   but, I didn't need a smoke. I needed the break, I needed some nice deep breaths of oxygen, I needed a moment to collect my thoughts.        Smoking was non essential and facilitated nothing but bondage.   
^^ Yes, yes, yes....that was me also! Although I would sit on my front patio!  It was difficult for me that first spring and summer of my 2017 Quit but I worked through it gradually and before I knew it the trigger was gone!!!
    Thanks for posting this. I am struggling with this a LOT. 
    yep, mrsguest it is hard.   I felt like jumping out of my skin  but, taking breaths (oxygen became my new drug of choice)   peeling a satsuma and enjoying that delicious-ness  helped me a lot. Also WATER.  Water water water !   And throwing any kind of distraction my way, jumping jacks, screaming showers etc.  I would sit and sketch or write just to give my fingers something to do.@jillar  made a fake smoke with just a straw and sucked on that.        Believe us, mrsguest, it gets better.  You won't feel terrible forever, I promise.  Each crave you beat reclaims a receptor in your brain.       
    Oh yes my best friend was my JAC (jillars air cigarette) except I didn't use a straw or pen like many others had. Mine was invisible and I never had to worry about forgetting it anywhere lol.  
    I had to keep my mind busy ...jigsaws ...crosswords ...playing candy crush ....ect....  I didn't even know how to be a adult without my crutch....  But everytime I did  something without a smoke ...it got easier ....we have to retrain  our brains .... Maybe start a new hobby...a few here have took up knitting ....knit a scarf....make it as long as you like ....
    I've been putting together lots of jigsaw puzzles! 
    I sucked on cinnamon sticks like Jillars Air Smoke
    Oh my go to candy was soft peppermint puffs. I bought by the bucket that first six months or so lol.    So my fellow Jill, I occupied my mind by staying glued to the board. I found that reading posts, supporting others, celebrating milestones, socializing and playing games really helped keep my mind off my misery 
    I've been on dum-dum suckers! when you save the wrappers you can play a game online and win stuff. I've collected a few lol
    Hey! Whatever works to keep cigarettes out of your mouth is a good thing, right?    You're doing great! Keep moving forward because it will get easier the more time you invest in yourself and your quit   
I struggle with this too. I now take my dog for 3 walks a day, ha! I work from home and I would go outside for a cigarette break every hour. Now I just go outside and look around at the neighborhood and take deep breaths. This doesn't cause cravings but I need the break. The association with smoking is getting weaker.
    G’day   My little saviour was a packet of tic tags. Just like a cig packet, I had something to carry around and worry about losing. I got to check the packet to make sure I wouldn’t run out before I could restock.   Most important I could allow myself a little reward inside a building even among non smokers! And it was socially except able to offer them around. My blind friend got to recognise me by the fruity smell rather than the stinky smoke smell.     I still keep a packet in my car... they are still my reward for staying calm in traffic without OD ing on to much sugar!

I saw on the NOPE thread that our friend, @Tammy    had bad smokey dreams last night.   It is always horrible to realize how deep out addiction goes.   Our subconscious is ripe ground and it takes time to purge. It is a wake up call to how entrenched addiction is.    But, there is also a physical reason, it is about the cilia in our lungs removing tar.      Joel says interesting things about Dreams in this video,    how the cilia are continuing to clean up while we sleep which may generate smells and taste of tobacco and trigger the dream.               Should you want to delve deeper into the psychology of this, here is a study on PDF.Dream of Absent-Minded Transgressiohttps: An Empirical Study of a Cognitive Withdrawal  Abstract    Among 293 smokers abstinent for between 1 and 4 weeks, 33% reported having at least 1 dream about smoking. In most dreams, subjects caught themselves smoking and felt strong negative emotions, such as panic and guilt. Dreams about smoking were the result of tobacco withdrawal, as 97% of subjects did not have them while smoking, and their occurrence was significantly related to the duration of abstinence. They were rated as more vivid than the usual dreams and were as common as most major tobacco withdrawal symptoms. In subjects abstinent for 1 year, 63% recalled having dreams about smoking. They had on average 5 of them, and about a quarter occurred after the 6th month of abstinence. Having dreams about smoking was prospectively positively related to maintenance of abstinence. An explanation of this finding based on the association of smoking in dreams with aversive emotions is offered.  Edited January 7 by Sazerac
Only had 2 smoking dreams after quitting.  The first was at 3 weeks and the other at 6 months.  Nothing since.  I do recall the immense sense of disappointment that I had failed my quit immediately upon awakening....and the tremendous relief when I realized it was only a dream.  To me this was more evidence that smoking was a consuming thought, even subconsciously, for several months after I quit.        P.S. The first dream I was in bed smoking and all of my coworkers were sleeping on the floor, face down and butt naked.  A legitimate nightmare for sure.

Lovely post 
Wow...you just nailed it!  Awesome post, Julie!
and......PRINTING!
I owe parts of it to a friend who wrote me something similar when I was getting clean and sober. She isn't with me anymore. She relapsed and we've lost touch. I hope she's ok wherever she is and I know she wouldn't mind me tweaking and adding to her letter if it was going to help someone else. So, wherever you are Shannon.....thank you.
Brilliant, I love it. Sad and funny and true. A shot right to the heart, ((Jules))
yes, really, you just don't.  and we stand by you, because we can and always will, and you just don't. What happens is you look in a mirror and know a number of people are smiling behind you. You know you deserve more and so do your friends. and so you don't. xx

Bump
hi to everyone that remembers me from a while ago, just a quick note to say that I am still not smoking even after coming up against most of the excuses available to us. ie. pub,holidays,birthdays,funerals,stressed,peer pressure etc.Been through all of them and not smoked, so for anyone just starting out, its hard, but don't think it cant be done. Smoking ruled my life for over 30 years and now I am coming up to 2years not smoking. There is no tip I can give anyone other than what some of the wiser people here have said to me and many others, and that is to not light a cigarette and take a puff of it.Do whatever you need to get through the initial cravings, just don t smoke.My younger sister is trying to give up now,and names me as an inspiration. She s called me many things over the years, but never that, so I am taking that one, and feel quite proud. Good luck anyone starting out, and well done those still going. Pedro
    Woohoo.... how great does it feel to be an inspiration to someone!      Oh @reciprocity ... you need to squeeze another Lido woohoo welcome party into the January Calendar... dunno what was in the water last January but these boys are showing us en mass just how this quit thing is done.
    Hey Pedro !!!.....good to hear from you ....    Good for you ,playing it forward and showing your sister the way ....x
Great to hear from you @pedro68! Of course I remember you. You quit just a couple weeks before I did. That's another great point you make about your sister and how she's looked to you for her own inspiration to quit. The pride of accomplishing this goes on and on  Congrats on 2 Years Pedro. On to 3 years now
    Congratulations Pedro ! How wonderful you have been an inspiration for your sister, that is grand.
    Congratulations Pedro, two years quit is AWESOME! 
    Congratulations Pedro!  That is awesome!
C'mon, smile.  You always look so serious.      I used to hear those lines all the time, for over a decade.  And there was a good reason.  I kept my mouth closed like a vise (vice for you Brits).  It all started when I was 39 and I made a routine trip to the dentist.  He did that thing where he pushed a tool under my gums at each tooth and called out a number.  5, 7, 7, 9, 8, 5, 9, 8, etc.  Apparently high numbers (on a scale of 1-10) were bad.        "We're going to have to extract 4 teeth today and send you to a periodontist.  You probably have some hereditary periodontal disease, but smoking for decades is likely the biggest contributor".       WTF!  I had used a Sonicare toothbrush ever since they first came out.  At least twice a day.  I flossed and used a Waterpik every evening.  But those tools were not powerful enough weapons to combat the damage smoking was doing to my mouth.  The sad thing is, I continued to smoke for another decade.  And the problems grew worse.  4 bridges, 2 crowns, and receding  gum lines that made my teeth look twice as long as normal.  My solution was to never smile.         Long story short, I had to have all my teeth removed last year.  Had to choose between dentures ($10K out of pocket) or full implants ($47K out of pocket).  I chose the later, and am happy with the aesthetic result, but it will never feel the same as my real teeth and I'll be paying off the implants for years.     I know there are much more serious consequences to smoking out there.  Cancer, heart disease, COPD, etc.  But I just wanted to bring up one of the not so obvious damages that may occur as a result of long term smoking.  Please throw this on your pile of concerns if you're young and considering quitting now.        The good news is, I've never felt better since I quit smoking, and I now have good reason to smile about my life of freedom.
I am a toothless wonder, too, BKP ! For sure, smoking had a lot to do with it   and combined with hereditary issues...  my gnashers didn't stand a chance.      You look great, BKP.         Edited January 3 by Sazerac
Me too!  I tell my husband my diamonds are all in my mouth.  I do have genetics that played a huge part but know smoking did not help.  I spent many years trying to save my teeth, with gum surgery, root canals and crowns.  Finally a dentist told me my teeth were not in the bone and just floating.   Options - $50,000 to surgically go in and wire them all together or $27,000 to have them removed, with three implants to hold the teeth on the bottom.  Insurance would not even pay for the removal of the teeth.      I chose the second option.  I still had to have bone and skin graphs for the implants.      It was all very painful and expensive.      My original two front teeth were crooked.  The dentist asked me if I wanted to keep that with false teeth.  I thought he was nuts.  I wasn't going to pay all that money to have crooked teeth. Needless to say, I hate my teeth now.  I can not get used to them not being crooked.  That must have been my character!     You do look wonderful BKP.  They may have been expensive but a much better option and more like your own teeth.           Edited January 3 by Linda Thomas
    Thank you for sharing that BKP, gum disease is serious. My aunt didnt smile and told nobody her situation, one day she was sick and couldnt chew from what i saw. I asked her to open her mouth and she was hesitant and when she finally let me see THERE WAS ONLY ONE MOLAR IN HER MOUTH! She had her front teeth (all stained from smoking) but had all the rest pulled and she didnt have the money and didnt ask about options (depression) for a solution.
    Smile... you look great     I had peridontal disease too, still got all my teeth , but had extensive cleaning done over several sessions and cost lots of ££££££££££££££££££££/s   again caused by smoking.

I have bad genetics, long term effects of chemotherapy AND smoking.   I have had root canals, crowns, and eventually extractions.   I have two implants on the lower left side that holds a three tooth bridge (a process that took 6 months but was worth it).   I have a traditional bridge on the lower right side along with several crowns on the upper teeth.     I think I have spent more money on my teeth over the years than my regular doctor.      Model of what my implant/bridge looks like.     Quick edit.  When I was 18 and and just started chemo, my oncologist said I need to get to the dentist for a checkup and stay on top of any issues.   My Mom thought dental care was the least of my problems and wanted to put it off.   We then got a lecture on the effects of chemo and dental health, which could lead to complications during treatment.Edited January 4 by Wayne045
    Yup. I too have had issues with my teeth due to smoking.  Having some grafting done later this year....Gums have just receded so much.  Thank God implants are an option now but damn, that's expensive.

Thank God implants are an option now but damn, that's expensive.                Yes they are.  Plus it's a long, multi-step process, Your regular dentist has to make molds of your teeth.   Then dental surgery to remove the dead tooth or teeth (if you still have them) and put in the implant(s), then a 5-7 month wait while your bone and jaws heal.  Then the posts are put on followed by your normal dentist to attach the bridge.        If you can afford it though, it is definitely worth it.
    This was one of greatest fears, losing my teeth. I've realized my gums have receded.    A man I know, someone who works near me has only a few random teeth. Stained teeth. I don't know how or what he eats. He's very thin. He smoked for decades. Then his doctor told him he could expect to die in a year or so or quit smoking.  He quit cold turkey. Says he misses it nearly every day  but won't go back.
Additional Data Point: While you can never reverse the damage of periodontal disease, it can be halted in its tracks.   One day,  unexpected and out of the blue, the nice hygeinist lady asked "Has anyone talked with you about ... <erie pause> ... Periodontal Disease ... Mr. The Sarge ?" ... "Uhhhhh ... nope ..."   Progressed for 3 years. Had to have the ol' under-the-gumline root planing / deep scraping.  Twice. Next up: Surgery. They basically cut the gums away from the jawbone, roll 'em outa the way, and go to town on the teeth roots.  Yikes!      Fast forward 2 years:  Quit smoking.    Active Gum Disease all but disappeared.     Gums returned to pink, and plump, and healthy.  No sign of active disease for the past 5 years.     There's still the bone loss and receeded gums ... but it's stable. No change in half a decade.  They even quit measuring and reading out the numbers (Sarge wasn't quite as bad - highest of 5 (2,2,4,3,5,4,5 3.3....) ) at every appointment because they were no longer changing progressing. Two changes were made: (1) Flossing twice daily - whether needed or not (previously Sarge only flossed when a hunk o' something was stuck up in there) ... and (2) quitting the cancer-sticks.  Dentist could neither confirm nor deny which had a larger benefit, but the two together cinched the deal.   Quit smoking, folks.    Your future teeth will thank you.   Sarge had perfectly sound, healthy, good teeth that would have fallen out of his head by now due to bone loss from the gum disease.     Now? Problem solved. Complete remission. No sign of active disease.     Sarge is certain he'd be in dentures by now if he hadn't quit.  EZPZ    PS: Your heart and arteries will love you, too. There's a funky correlation between gum disease and heart disease.
I'm fortunately out of the 5's and 6's but still have some 4s and need to get my teeth cleaned 3 or 4 times a year. I lost a tooth because it cracked and wasn't fixed in time for a root canal (long story). Whenever I have tooth pain I get trigeminal neuralgia symptoms that resolve when the problem is fixed but for that reason I elected not to get an implant so I just wear a partial denture for a few hours a day to stop the other teeth from moving. It is a back tooth and you cannot see it.       I use a water pick, an electric tooth brush and floss every day. I have been regularly going to the dentist for cleaning for the past decade and that has helped a lot to save my teeth. Smoking did a lot of damage to my gums and they have receded but are pretty healthy now for the most part.
The first of the year is a popular quit day.  Are you lurking here, counting down the days? If so, bravo!  Stay close to this site.   My last cigarette was 9/26/2016.  I know the angst, excitement, fear, determination, grief, etc that often accompanies a quit.  If your quit date is Jan 1 2019- you have time to prepare.  What is your plan?  What quit method best suits you? Cold turkey, patches, gum, meds...?  Then...what will you do when that first wave of a crave crashes over you? How about the next one that nearly drowns you?        I have had multiple failed quit attempts.  Maybe the reason I failed is because I was not honest w myself.  When I was honest w myself, I succeeded.  My honest mantra went something like this~ quitting sucks.  Quitting really sucks.  This sucks. It won’t suck like this forever.  I will not smoke today even though it really hurts. My head, my nerves, my whole being hurts.  Quitting sucks. Addiction sucks.  Quitting will not be easy.  I will not smoke today.  Play, rewind,repeat until the deed is done.       You can quit. You have support & resources here. Use them. You will quit.       Welcome to the other side!      -L4L
    Great post lust  I wanted to share that one preparation step I took was to stop smoking where I normally smoked so that when I quit I didn't associate those places with smoking.

I'm going for a run in the morning and will be regularly running alongside eating well. This is it for me. Onwards and upwards people. Good luck if you are also quitting and we'll done to everyone already quit.

Sharing my blog post here too because I feel in a "new year, new start" sort of mentality that it may speak to even one person.         I've umm'ed and ahh'ed about writing another blog entry, I don't like to be rushed I guess. I thought I was in  a new year and heading for my 4th year quit but on perusing the site, transpires I'm heading for my 5th lol. Smoking is an enigma to me now but those who knew my habit 2+ packs a day for years can't believe I have stayed quit *cough, this site* and new friends can't imagine me as a smoker! The latter is a compliment for sure.     However when I quit it was with two others. My Mum and my then boyfriend, now just one of my best friends. Both relapsed. Chris, my friend, smokes heavily again and has done for 4 years, no quit in sight. Sadly my Mum damaged herself too heavily and last May, 1 day before her 70th birthday, I stood at her bedside after the awful news she wouldn't make it - to talk her over to the other side. Our relationship had been fairly strained but I'm pleased we had marginally reconnected for a few months before she died of multiple organ failure - drinking and smoking were at the heart of it all, quite literally. I have the most awful memories and photographic evidence of me holding her hand and cuddling in as I was telling her to look for our loved ones...when we should have been preparing for her birthday.       If you have children and are on the fence then please consider that it isn't just you who suffers. Get educated and be real.        The quit itself is effortless now. I remember at times that I would have smoked here and smile that it means absolutely nothing, it simply a memory. My children are level 4 and 5 (red and green belt) at mixed martial arts where I used the money from quitting to put them in a club to train. I should really go to that gym I pay for more, oops, but I can still run faaarrrr better than I ever could as a smoker, even with the gaps in training haha. The quit bought me strength, joy and healthier finances....I have never looked back. I completely retrained myself with a new career and am happily teaching both Reiki healing and Tarot Cards that I trained in.      My point is the quit bought me nothing but good and joy. Those who didn't commit have a painful story attached.         Love to all. Marti. xx
Thanks Marti for your personal story.   You are 100% correct too. There's NO downside to quitting. Only good things in your future as a non smoker       And, Happy New Year to you!Edited January 2 by reciprocity

Not only did you build yourself a fine, sturdy quit but, you helped so many along the way.  I am one of those that benefited from your experiences and encouragement.   Thank you, baby, and have a splendid 2019.Edited January 3 by Sazerac
    Thanks a lot for sharing this. Sorry to hear about the passing of your mum and your friend's relapse.       I long so much for smoking being just a memory. I know that every day is part of the trip, but how I whish I could fast forward time and just be done with it!      Thanks again @Marti, this gives me hope. 
    I'm currently going through an internal battle of trying not to smoking  and lacking the motivation to stop; leaving me sooo frustrated and feeling like a failure in my loved ones' eyes. Is it possible to get some advices??
Hi Lia! Welcome to Quit Train. I see your quit date is Jan. 1, 2019 yet you say you are trying to not smoke now. Have you quit yet or are you just cutting down and plan to quit on New Years Day? What is you quit plan? Are you planning to use nicotine replacement products like the patch or nicotine gum or are you quitting cold turkey (no nicotine products)? Quitting is unpleasant in the early days because your body and mind will be going through a lot of changes but you will make it through like everyone does if you just make up your mind not to smoke. It takes an unwavering commitment on your part to quit - it's that simple. Hope to see you around the forum. Best wishes.
    Welcome to QuitTrain, Lia.  Quitting smoking is a truly great thing to do and your life improves greatly, in many ways, after quitting for good.        Learning about nicotine addiction is a big key to quitting.  The more you know about it, the more prepared you are to leave nicotine behind for good.  Read a lot in the "quit smoking discussions" part of this site.  There is a lot of good advice there regarding challenges people may experience during the early stages of their quits.   As reciprocity asked, are you currently smoking or planning on quitting on New Year's Day?
    Thank you for responding and your kind advice. No I haven't quit as yet.  My intention is quitting cold turkey by New Years Day but I'm just trying to get my mentality right currently (and cutting down) so I'll be able to go through the whole process successfully. I know I will succeed ; I just need to get my priorities straight.
    Welcome aboard Lia....  Spend the time ,before your quit date reading all you can here ...knowledge is what you fight this horrible addiction with ...  Learn all you can...    You will find plenty of great posts here...on the main board they are pinned with a green square....watch all Joels video,s....they cover more or less everything you wish to know ..   It's doable ....you have a train full of quitters ..who will tell you .....you can .....you just have to want it bad enough...  Life without a nicotine addiction is wonderful....the only way to find out ...is Quit .....

Hi Lia.  You will succeed.  All you have to do is stop smoking.  I smoked for 42 years and tried everything to quit, including help through my physician.  Nothing worked.  I was always searching for ways to quit and came across this forum.  I am now almost to my fifth month of not smoking.  This forum has all the information and a wonderful group of people ready to help guide you through and support you. Yes, the first week is a little tough, but doable.  Once the nicotine is out of your system, you just learn to redirect your brain when those craves pop up.    I look forward to helping you through this journey.
    Thank you Linda! I appreciate your support 
Lia welcome aboard, I am happy to see that you are planning to quit.  The best advice I can give right now is to thoroughly go thru this site and read everything you can prior to Jan. the 1st, this way you can build up your resolve and educate yourself.  Also go thru some of the posts that we all have been part of -- again a lot to gleam there.  Once you quit, lots of cold water to drink and deep breathing techniques then go to the daily NOPE pledge and post everyday -- it really helps.  Just remember we will be here for you!!!
Thank you Martian5!  I will continue doing your suggestions!

There is only one priority required to quit smoking and that is a commitment to never smoking another puff again.

As for "cutting down"...    You may find this interesting,  our friend, Joel, discusses quitting by gradual withdrawal (i.e. torture)Quitting by Gradual Withdrawal     Should you quit now, you will be 10 glorious days into your quit for the New Year ! Please, think about it.  Every day is the best day to quit !Edited December 22, 2018 by Sazerac
    Thank you Sazerac for sharing that information with me! I'm going through all of it right now 
Welcome Lia... stock up on juice... I kid you not it is a godsend.. @Sazerac explains it better but giving up nicotine affects your bodies ability to control blood sugar, its why so many quitters crave sugar... this effect is short term... but it doesn't help with the whole process... so you need to stay hydrated and you need to keep your blood sugar levels up... so drink juice.. 2 birds, 1 stone... it actually really helps.        I used NRT... because for me I knew that was my best option, I needed to break the emotional and habit side of the quit more than the physical side, past quits had taught me that was my biggest weakness the emotional addiction. That said I was very strict with my use of gum... and set a stringent timeline for me to get off it... what I can tell you is that it gave me the buffer I needed to break the habit/reflex side of my addiction before dealing with fully with the detox side. So that's the upside.. the down side is that in hindsight it drew it out when I finally gave up the NRT too (about week 9) I had a bit of a revist to the first few weeks of intensity... so it prolonged the hard physical stage. It worked for me, in hindsight I would like to say I would go cold turkey but cold turkey was not going to work for me. The thing is, everyone's quit is an individual experience and what works for one might not work for another.     If you can get a copy of it before your quit date you should read the Alan Carr book... I read it after I had quit and it was worth it then but it is a really helpful quit tool, especially if you are going cold turkey.      You can do this. You have total control over this, only you can pick up a smoke, put it in your mouth and set it on fire... only you control that... I am so looking forward to sharing your journey... read everything, ask questions, but most importantly just take it one day at a time... just focus on 24 hours... you can't change yesterday and tomorrow isn't here yet, just quit for one day at a time. Once you have one day, you know you can do it... and little by little each day gets easier.

My only problem with that though is that I've been on the ketogenic diet for the past month (so I haven't been intaking any sugar). I've been trying to overcome one of my biggest personal fears which is gain weight as it puts me in an intense, unhealthy depression. Unfortunately, I have mentally  attached smoking with weight loss/ weight maintenance. So I'm trying to break away from that dysfunctional correlation with a healthier way to lose weight.        However, I will start reading the Alan Carr book you also suggested! And I really do appreciate your delightful and encouraging words!

Just think of it this way "Does it make sense to destroy our health just to stay thin?"

When I quit, i cut back from 30 smokes and for three days, I allowed myself three cigarettes.   My quit date was set up for a Friday so I would have the weekend to suffer the initial shock. I do not work weekends. So my last smoke was right before i went to bed so I could wake up to a new life of not smoking.      That would be my advice. If you cannot quit today, then pick a date in the near future where you will have a couple stress free days, a couple days that you can go through the initial shock or whatever.      Just keep something in mind though. Some of us have different emotional triggers that make us want to light up. For some it is stress, for some it's boredom, and for some (like me) it is when we get excited or want to "celebrate" something.        If you are a "stress smoker", keep in mind that after the first is when companies want to "roll out" their biggest bullshit that is going to cause grief for the employees. If you can quit even a few days before THAT hits, all the better. At least you will have a few days of getting used to not smoking before that.
Welcome Lia and congratulations on deciding to quit this nasty addiction. I didn't pick a quit date but knew it was time to quit so one thing I did in preparation was to quit smoking in the place I normally smoked. Which for me was my garage. This totally helped me disassociate that area with smoking and I wouldn't get a crave when I was in there after I quit. Maybe start doing that?       Edited December 24, 2018 by jillar

If you smoke, that's your biggest problem and quitting needs to become your primary focus! It's the thing that puts your life, your very future, at risk! Smoking gives you nothing ..... makes nothing in your life better and will likely shorten your life.      Am I missing the "good things" smoking does for you? Right; there are none! You are just feeding an addiction - that's it, that's all!      We condition our brains to believe we are settling our anxiety by smoking in stressful situations when we are really just avoiding dealing with those situations while we feed our addiction. The relief we feel is because we needed that nicotine fix. Our real life problem is still there waiting for us.       This is why education about the addiction is SO important. Understanding what''s really going on. Once you do, you'll get it and your resolve to quit will be strengthened 10 fold! You CAN do it just like we all have

And I really do appreciate your delightful and encouraging words!          Hi Lia, I am about 12 days quit smoking and two or three days off of the nicotine patch. I wanted to first break the habit and then deal with the chemical withdrawal. It seems to have been a good strategy.   I weighed in at Weight Watchers at 220 about 13 years ago. Then over three years I lost weight and part of that was by smoking, not eating. I dropped to 145 lb, which is on the slim side for my height and age.   For ten years I kept it off, until I made a job change from an active to a sedentary one,  and then the weight began creeping back up. My biggest hurdle to quitting smoking was the fear of becoming obese again. I can't count the times I stopped smoking, then started in again because I was over eating and becoming clinically depressed.        Through reading and videos on YouTube by medical researchers, doctors, and nutritionists, I learned about eating a plant based diet and about extended fasting. Confidence in the information about the diet gives me confidence that I'll get my weight back to slim. (I'm actually barely at the "overweight" stage, I have about 18 lb to lose).     When I believed that my choice was smoking or obesity, I chose smoking, repeatedly. Just as learning about addiction makes it possible to quit smoking, I believe that learning lots about health and nutrition will make it possible to avoid long term weight gain.       Best of luck to you Lia. So many people have successfully quit smoking, that I know you can be a success story, as well. You've already got your goal in mind, and a strategy -- breaking  the dysfunctional correlation between smoking and weight maintenance. I know you'll develop the tactics to make your goal a reality. It'll be fun to hear your story along the way.
Lia here is an idea, it is how I managed to finally quit. Mine was in Oct 2017 though.  So New year's eve is on a Monday. If you do not work the weekend, that might mean you have a three day weekend. That will give you those first three and hardest days to suffer in peace without the stress of being at work.To clear your mind.    Three days might not seem like much but I believe if a smoker can make it THAT long with no nicotine/tobacco, he or she has proven to themselves they CAN do it so they can feed off that accomplishment as motivation.     Between now and Friday, maybe cut way back on smoking (I went from 30 a day to three a day) then Friday night before you go to bed, that will be your dead last cigarette. Also by that time, all your cigarettes, ash trays, and other smoking stuff should be gone. Give it away, throw it away, whatever. Saturday you wake up a non-smoker.     During those first three days, start cleaning everything you can. All laundry, bed sheets, walls, etc. You are done smoking at that point so might as well get it completely out of your life. Of course if you smoked only outside, it won't take as much cleaning.        Maybe you are scared to quit, like "Oh my god, how will I do it?" I remember thinking that but when I put out my final smoke and went to bed, the first day wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Most important, you have to want this quit. You have to demand it. You have to reach out and TAKE that quit. Push past every crave and temptation and be GREEDY with that quit that is yours. Do not let temptation have it.        If you are able to quit THIS day then even better but I was not able to just quit with no solid plan. Many decry the "cut back" method but for some of us it did work.  If you can make it even ONE complete day without smoking, like from wake-up to bed time again, you have just proven it IS possible to quit.         On 12/22/2018 at 11:18 AM, Linda Thomas said:               Hi Lia.  You will succeed.  All you have to do is stop smoking.  I smoked for 42 years and tried everything to quit, including help through my physician.  Nothing worked.          The reason stop-smoking drugs, patches, gums, getting stabbed with needles, hypnosis, whatever do not work is because if they DID, people would stop buying them when the nicotine crave vanished. They do not want to lose customers any more than the pricks who make cigarettes want to lose customers.

We all quit and we are not special snowflakes, just nicotine addicts like you.  Looking forward to your quit, the self confidence and self respect that we acquire  when we quit the addiction is a beautiful sight to behold.  You are going to really love your life free of nicotine !
    Your step toward freedom from being a slave to nicotine is getting close now Lia. This should make you very happy, although most of us approach this time with unwarranted fear. Fear of the unknown. Fear of failing. All this is unwarranted because once you make the leap, you will do the best you can and you will gather all the quit tools you need as you make the journey. There's a ton of information here on the site to help you with that. The other great news is you will have a ton of people all around you here on the Quit Train to lend what every support you want or need. You will never walk this path alone as long as you're logged on here  So I guess my message is, don't fear what's in front of you, look forward to starting on the most beneficial journey of your life  See you in a couple of days!
    You can do it Lia ...   Looking forward to travelling along with you ....
Thank you all for the support!! DAY 1 without a cigarette!!!
    Glad to hear Lia .... Keep going, one day at a time   That;s how we all become smoke free for life!
Good to see you Lia, congratulations on starting 2019 smoke free
    Happy New Year Lia.  Perfect day to start your smoke free journey!  First week will be tough but you are tougher.  Read everything you can on the forum and stay close.  We are here for you!
Stay strong Lia...it won 't be long until you love the smell of NO SMOKE on anything you wear! And not being looked at like a piece of poo when you are out smoking in the corner of where ever you are. Tomorrow will be 60 days for me and I have to say, it hasn't been quite as hard as what I was afraid it would be, but I have certainly had my moments and still do. Just remember the first week and how you felt and hopefully that will keep you from going back to that point. It has worked for me so far, as I never want that feeling again! Good luck...you can do this!
That's awesome, Lia!  Congrats on Day 1 and Happy New Year!
    Awesome job on the first day Lia -- you can do this.  Tough at first but the rewards are so worth it and you will begin seeing them soon!!!!
    Yay.  Stay focused you will succeed.
    Yeah for you!!!! Best thing ever! Rewards....however small helped me so much!

    Apparently, mirror neurons are a tool in our mental survival kit. We watch other people, and if they live, we do what they did.     I know, that's way simplistic.      I've been feeling very low about having to travel. I don't like to fly anymore. I was a flight attendant for seven years and loved it. Don't know why I don't want to fly again.    So, feeling low, and wanting to smoke.      Yesterday, a shopper came unhinged and loudly and harshly berated me for the way I was ringing up her purchases. She immediately demanded a manager. I called for a manager, then remained  quiet, respectful and apologized, and offered to allow another cashier to help her.  The manager arrived, I finished the transaction, and continued on until the next break.  I was seething with suppressed anger. (Before I went home, the manager called me aside and said that this is typical behavior for that customer; I did nothing wrong.)        At my break, I recounted to another cashier what happened and told her I really wanted a cigarette. I explained that I had quit, but right now was wishing I hadn't. I wanted to smoke. Turns out she smokes; "I keep it to four or six a day."  I had a brief memory of having told myself I'd just have four or six a day. Ha!  I kept myself from asking her for a cigarette.        I strongly craved a cigarette for the rest of the day and during my commute home. I was sorely tempted to ditch my quit.    As I drove, I don't know why, but I thought about mirror neurons and how they are related to learning, peer pressure,  and crowd behavior--the copy-cat effect. I rambled from thought to thought about it and then said to myself, "I can use this to counter the desire to smoke right now."      I imagined two groups of people. I saw one group avidly sucking on cigarettes on a sunless day, with smoke billowing around and smelling up their clothes, hair, and breath. With x-ray eyes, I saw the smoke curling inside their lungs and saw damage being done to their bodies.         The other group I imagined were jogging or swimming, biking, gardening, everyone in the sunshine and breathing the fresh air easily.    I imagined myself walking on by the haggard looking, diseased smoking group and taking a walk in the park in the sunshine with my small dog, breathing fresh air and feeling great.     I began to relax. I mindfully kept my attention on the sunny people, focusing on how these were the survival behaviors, and saw myself copying what they were doing.        I thought about these mirror neurons and the impact my return to smoking could have on another new quitter on the QT forum.  And what would I say in a post? Lame excuses, that's what. What if my returning to QT as a relapsed smoker, having to start over, triggered a copycat effect in one or more other QTers. I'd feel terrible.            Mirror neurons and the copycat effect. We have to be careful about where we turn our attention, be mindful about whom we emulate, and remember that other people may be copying our behavior.       I still feel low about having to fly, but I didn't smoke.       Another day of appreciating QT and saying "no" to cigarettes.        
    Great post Kate and so helpful to so many. You are doing great with your quit and already paying it forward which we all really appreciate  I hope you find flying a little easier now that you won't have to be worried about finding the nearest smoking area  
    Wow !! Kate ...some people are rude for sure ....   Well done ...you stayed strong ....you didn't let the sad folks spoil your quit ...you should feel so proud ....    Hoping further into your quit ...you will be able to fly again and not worry.....   You chose Freedom...great job !!!!
    G’day   Those people are put in this world.... to make the rest of us look good!    Your right Kate it’s all about, how you think about things. C
Today was easier keeping the quit and minimizing the power of craving, in part because I held to visual images of diseased, hunched over smokers, and walking on into the sunshine to be in fresh air on a walk with my dog.    A surprise visit at my store where I cashier from my former supervisor at the store I worked at previously. I asked her to pass on to a co-worker that I had quit, finally. He had been very supportive and recommended a 12-step approach to quitting. I am feeling more confident.
    Way to go Kate, it's the new year, and time for new awareness maybe in the way we approach our craves and fight this addiction.     I think it also links back to the mindful meditation bit somewhere, you gotta focus on the present, and see it for what it is. The "ugly" picture of the smokers life is fact, hence as easy to picture, and focusing on not wanting to end up like that is great motivation.   Great post, good thoughts.      Keep it up.
    Kate ...Your doing great ....   Just visualise... Your nice healthy pink lungs ...to those dirty black ones of a smoker ...take in those great deep breaths of fresh air ...    I got a buzz early on I'm quit ..standing at the back door ,and breathing in and out for a few good deep breaths ...a feel good factor !!!!.....
    Great post, Kate, and you're doing awesome with your quit.  These incidents make you stronger and now you have a tool you can use next time.
    Your visualizations of smokers and non smokers and wanting to be with the non smokers shows good progress. Keep it up. Visualizing smoking as a good or desirable thing is just perpetuating the lies you addiction has told you all these years. You're a non smoker now and starting to see the many benefits of that lifestyle. It will get even better. Keep fighting   
    Might be TLTR for some:         Big Quit Day for so many.  Congratulations for resolving to quit this nasty addiction!  The first few days & weeks might be easy or horrific.  If your chosen Quit method looks like it might fail- choose another. That is, if cold turkey ain’t cuttin’ it- chew some nico - gum or suck on a lozenge. Slap a patch on if needed. Talk to your doc & get some meds.       Your Quit is your quit. Own it. Protect it. Do it & be done with it.        You will find support here.         Do not smoke today. Wake up tomorrow and do the same.  Wake up the next day and do the same.        One minute at a time will become one hour that will become one day that will become one week that will become one month...      Take it one day at a time.  Wake up declaring you won’t smoke this day.  Go to bed screaming “ heck yeah, I didn’t smoke today!”        Wake up. Repeat.        You can do this.  It SUCKS and that’s OK.       Your will to be healthier for yourself, your spouse, your child(ren), your wallet...        IS stronger than your addiction!        Let those reasons fuel the fight.       Happy New Year! 
    "Happy New You Year"    LOVE this, great post lust      So many great points above, I was glued to the board everyday all day my first year. Reading, supporting, celebrating or just playing games really helped keep my mind off my misery. Use the boards and us as needed. Post an SOS if you feel yourself in danger of caving to a crave. Remind yourself everyday how glad you are to be past it and that you never want to have to repeat it. Also consider getting yourself a ticker for your signature. It's a great way to watch the money, time and cigarettes not smoked add up. Super inspiring   Remember you have years of successful quitters on your side and here for you as needed or wanted. We know what you're going through because we've been through it too
Overall I feel 100% better than I did 60 days ago. But I have noticed that my breathing seems more labored...maybe shorter than it did before i quit. I feel it working out , in bed or just setting . I do have an inhaler I use when necessary but it seems worse than before. I know what this is from , just wondering if any of you noticed this when you quit.
That happened to me too wantsit. My breathing got worse for two or three weeks and I was using my inhaler way more than normal. My pulmonologist said it was my lungs working at clearing out the gunk.     It seems to be a pretty normal recovery symptomEdited January 2 by jillar
Thank you! I've noticed it for about the last 2 weeks and it just had me a bit concerned. I really haven't noticed any  junk since I've quit and I figured after all those years I would have. Just more coughing than usual and the above mentioned.
I was about a month in to my quit when my breathing got worse and like I said it did take a good  three weeks or so for it to start getting better. I didn't really cough anything up either but I did notice I cleared my throat more. My phlegmy cough stopped right after I quit though. Luckily coughing isn't the only way of clearing the lungs Its also never a bad idea to get a checkup after quitting. If for nothing else but the self assurance that everything sounds good and the pats on the back for quitting Edited January 2 by jillar
Thank you Jillar. I've felt all the above. I did go to the Dr. about 4-5 months ago and at that time everything looked good. Thank you for your response...it's made me feel better for the time being.
    Hi wantsit, thats the healing process. Some have it worse/ longer. The cilia start to work again ..."As the cilia recover and the mucus is cleared from your lungs, you might cough more than usual — perhaps for several weeks. In addition to reduced cough, most other respiratory symptoms, such as phlegm (mucus) production and shortness of breath, continue to improve for up to a year after stopping cigarette smoking."

    Thank you all! Was thinking to myself the other day  just my luck...I quit to late.
Yea, I did too wantsit AND I almost talked myself into going back to smoking because my breathing was better before I quit. Which wasn't saying much since that was why I quit to begin withEdited January 2 by jillar
Never too late, takes time to heal but heal it does... After i first quit i would walk a couple of blocks and breathe like a bulldog, my breathing kept improving. I can walk miles now and breathe fine. Later in your quit when its cold out or windy you can see how your breathing/lungs are. 9 months - 1 year, let the lungs heal.

wow,,, thats awfull,I should be dead,,I smoked for 30 years,,,,,,   good post,,,,,      RC
Yeah I smoked for over 35 years and it is really sickening to think of all those years of inhaling toxic pollution.  It's a reality test for anyone struggling with their quit.

Who would want to continue after seeing what they are inhaling into their bodies on a daily basis
I remember junior high they showed us movies with anti-smoking messages where the main graphic was comparing smoker's lungs to non-smokers, which was gross, but what happens decades down the line doesn't matter to a teenager. I am in my 50s so these educational videos were a long time ago.      This is immediate and you see the effects cigarette by cig, day by day.Edited January 1 by onthemark
I dread to think of my poor lungs ...but !!!!   A Proud Quitter after 52 years.... It's never too late....
    What amazed me was how scary real the commercials against smoking became but how I would still ignore their message.  I would sit there trying to ignore them, hoping my husband wasn't paying attention.  Sometimes I would try to distract my husband's attention away from them.  I was ashamed inside and scared that most likely that was going to be my reality but not strong enough to change things.  I was addicted and had no idea how to change.  I had tried so many different ways to quit and was unsuccessful.      Somehow, I ended up finding this forum.  What is it that is so different about this place?  It is a place where no one looks down at you - they have all been there.  You were not there physically but it felt as if you took my hands and guided me through.  Smoking took my self esteem and power.  You showed me it was still there and that I could get it back.   
Gross.. when you see it like that.....
    It's crazy because there is a way back. The lungs will repair themselves to a very good degree. They may never be as good as new. You will have caused some irreparable damage but they will be in a lot better condition if you pack in because as I say some self repairing does take place.      First time I've seen a video like that and being so early into my new quit it has shocked me a lot.
I hope it shocked you in a good way. It is sort of funny in a way until you get to the end and see how bad that poisonous gunk is.      Yes, you are right that the body can repair but not all of it unfortunately. The sooner you quit the better. I quit when I was 52 and it was too late to avoid lung cancer, but, hey, here I am three years later and still doing ok, maybe done with that monster. At least I can hope so. Other people get copd, cvd and other cancers. It's never too late to quit but quitting when you are young is the best because the damage just accumulates.
    Was at a family get together. Went digging through my purse for something, then stopped with a second of fear, worrying whether my cigarettes would fall out of my purse. (I was a closet smoker.)  Then I remembered that I don't smoke.   Sigh of relief and bit of a chuckle.
There are a lot of positive OMG moments that take us by surprise once we quit. It really is amazing just how many moments of our daily lives were focused on some aspect of our nicotine addiction. So glad I don't have to worry about any of that stuff anymore  I never even give it a thought these days.Edited December 31, 2018 by reciprocity
    The benefits just keep adding up :)
    I reached into my golf bag after about one month and found an empty pack, oh yeah, I don't smoke.        
    I had a moment like that recently, had to laugh...non smoking life is so good!
...but thought I would take a chance.       I tried to bump one of his threads that was brought from QSMB and posted here, but was unable to locate them.       I was reminded on Facebook today by a close friend of it being 5 years December 28 since the passing of jwg. I don't know how many remember his inspiring and funny well written posts. If you do, you would know what a special person he was. He was not only special to the members that read them, but even more special as a personal friend to some of us that kept in closer contact with him up until the very end.     I just thought I would bring this up in case anyone that was touched by his writings would like to remember him once again. For me, it seems like only yesterday he was diagnosed with cancer at such a young age and the day he passed is still fresh in my mind. I will always miss him.
    I'll bump them Jan, looks like a few already have been bumped.
    I remember him so well....I was only months into my quit ...his post were magical....his untimely death hit me hard ...R.I.P......
    He was a star its a great pity he didn't make it.
    I read some of them on the QSMB and would love to have them here to read.
    I came to know of jwg through his posts on QSMB...after he was gone! His writing made an impact on so many...including me! RIP, sir!
    When QSMB went down, I lost a treasured message from him.  Rest in Peace, Invisible Man,
    He was great man, great friend to so many.   I no longer have my messages from him but I treasure the memories of our conversations.  He helped me so much when I first quit smoking.  Was one of the first to reach out to me privately to cheer me on.  RIP my friend.  
    I gained so much from his writings.... long after he was gone... I'm glad not all of his legacy was lost and that so many were supported by him.
Just out of curiosity...do any of you have spouses that continue to smoke? I'm finding it hard to deal with the smells at times. She doesn't smoke while in our truck and we never smoked in our homes, but when she comes in from having one I can hardly stand it. I try and remember it's only been a month and 8 days or whatever, and I don't want to be one of those people that start bitching now that I'm not smoking , but how do you deal with it ?  Finding it tough right now.
    I smoked for several years after my wife quit. She would comment once in awhile that she knew I just had a cig when I could not smell anything at all. She was really good about it though as she never did this in a way that made me feel bad or guilty. I always tried to be careful about smoking around her though because I respected the fact she was now a non-smoker and likely more sensitive to the smell of smoking.        I'm not sure there's any way to approach this with your wife in a manner that won't have her all up in arms about it. Smokers get pretty defensive about stuff like that - I know I did and I suspect you probably did too. More and more smokers are the outcasts of society these days so when your significant other starts in on you ..... look out.        If she is respecting your situation, in terms of not smoking openly around you and subjecting you to her second hand smoke on a regular basis, I would say that's probably the best you can hope for until she too is ready to quit. That may just happen too as you are setting a great example for her  
    We've had a lot of successful members who had a smoking spouse wantsit. Mine has always been a nonsmoker so I can't comment on that part BUT I can tell you that you're setting a great example for her to quit also  
    It's only when you quit ..you get to know how horrible that smell is ...as a smoker you carnt smell it ...  I agree ...hopefully your wife will see how brilliant you are doing ...and want to join you.... Deep down every smoker would love to quit ....
    My husband is a social smoker, he basically smokes on a Friday night. My father in law also stays with us on a Thursday and he smokes. It's pure rank. And omg kissing a smoker is so gross. Hands up I do say you stink, get away from me, omg you are stinking, aw man that smoke is awful etc. For me, saying nothing is not an option. To say nothing makes is seem like it's ok and clearly it's not. But each to their own. I don't give a shit if it pisses off my husband either. Suck it up or quit.       I did struggle a wee bit one night as I love my husband with all my heart and I was thinking what's the point in me quitting and him not. I really strongly felt that. No point me saving my health if he's just throwing his away. But my pals talked me round. Do not let your partners smoking jeopardise your own quit!!! Really cherish your quit and hold onto it dearly.         You asked how we deal with the smells? I just think ewww I'm sooo glad I don't smell like that anymore! It's so disgusting! And move on....      
My situation is similar to yours Weegie. My husband smokes at work, but never when he comes home for the evening or at weekends when he is with me. I can tell he has been smoking even when he tries to cover it up with body spray. It is a horrible smell, and I also thought why should I bother quitting if he is'nt!!!! At first it made me really mad as he initially quit about the same time as me, but then started the few at work. I have no idea how he refrains from smoking evenings and weekends, if it was me I would be back to 20 a day by now.  I am glad he is respectful of me and I never see him smoke, but I do resent him a bit and wish he would stop. However I have told myself he is responsible for what he does, and I want to hang on to my quit and I am so proud of it. Hopefully he will stop soon. I know he worries about his Mom who is in a nursing home with Dementia and going downhill fast, so maybe that is his way of coping. Look after you and your quit
I quit smoking 2 months ago and my husband still smokes. At times it can be pretty hard, but it does get easier. I defintely don't miss standing out in the freezing cold shivering and smoking... which I am reminded of every time he goes out for a smoke.
Mrs. Sarge smoked for close to 3 years after The Sarge quit. (She's been quit 4 years now)  At all times there were packs of smokes laying around, ashtrays all over the house, cartons in the cabinet/pantry ...   How do you deal with it?    You don't.  There is nothing to "deal with".    You are quit and your spouse is not.    No. Big. Deal.  You just carry on with your plan.   It was never a problem for The Sarges.  It won't be a problem for you if you don't want it to be.   If you are hedging for excuses, this it the perfect excuse.     Don't. Do. That.    It's not at all a problem if you don't want it to be.   EZPZ
I've never had a spouse so maybe not as qualified to comment, but I will anyway.   I watched this scenario play out prior to when I started smoking.   My Dad tried to quit way back in the mid 70's but my Mom didn't,  he made it almost a week with my Mom still smoking all over the house.  I think Dad would have been successful it it wasn't literally in his face the entire time.  He even said that to her face when she made a comment about willpower after he caved.  This was the 70's though, so of course smokers could smoke anywhere, anytime,  it didn't even occur to Mom to maybe go to the garage or outside to smoke.       My parents continued smoking up until their deaths, both had COPD/emphysema and both were very sedentary in their retirements.   My dad went into the hospital for the first (and last) time when he developed pneumonia.  He was forced to quit in the hospital, they gave him nicotine patches, but I'm sure he died wanting a cigarette.     My Mom was also forced to quit when her breathing got so bad she had to have oxygen 24/7.   It was a forced quit.   Also a cold-turkey quit as she refused any NRT.

There are never any packs laying around or ashtrays full, as I stated we do not smoke in our home and haven't for 20 years. I do hate the smell now point blank. She knows it, but cannot stop. I do not want want it to be a problem but will say when in a truck that smells of smoke...that is a problem , and made it hard for me to deal with , you are no undeniably a stronger person than I am as that made me want to smoke worse than I have in my quit.  I do have to deal with it...and will. Just looking to see how others did.
    Hey @Sslip you have any words of wisdom for Wantsit??        
A little different here. For the most part my wife vapes, so the smell isn't quite the same.            On 12/11/2018 at 6:11 PM, Wantsit said:             when she comes in from having on﻿e I can hardly stand it.               I'm not sure whether you mean you find it disgusting or appealing.      I think the key is to recognize the smell for what it is. If you find it objectionable then that should re-emphasize the benefits of the smart choice you have made. If you find the smell appealing and it causes you to question what you are missing out on then the key to that is to make sure you have that recall of why you have quit. For me, it was a struggle, but I recognized what damage I was doing to myself in so many ways. I didn't want to go back to that.     Whatever you do, you make your choice, but it is impossible for you to make it for others. That is all down to them and you can only set a good example. Maybe make sure you have a money jar for you to put the savings in to and treat yourself to something really quite special when you have the cash to do so.

Sslip,      The problem is I now find the smell disgusting. It  just stinks...period. I won't tell her she has to quit because I never know what will happen with me, I'm not even 2 months in yet. But some times it does make it hard for me and at the same time pisses me off. It's her call..I hope I make so she will see the difference it makes with me and decides do it as well. We all make our own choices and mine is to not smoke .  I'm thinking a new driver or putter this spring for my little reward.
    People have to want to quit ...you carnt force them...or degrade them ...it doesn't work... It just makes them more determined to smoke.... I know this by experience....   All you can do is let her see how wonderful it is to be free....and yes Rewards....just concentrate on your Quit....    I hope she joins you too....
    Sslip's idea of the money jar is a good one. Setting up and actual "quit, - money jar" and putting real money in it every day or at least every week might actually be a good subtle way of illustrating just one quit benefit to your wife. You can talk about saving until you're blue in the face but seeing IS believing! I expect it would give her pause for thought anyway.

    I live with two smokers and I notice the smell but only if I make a conscious effort to.        I was married to a non smoker and he never once mentioned the smell. I think ex smokers make a bigger deal out of it (or anything else to do with smoking) than non smokers do.         You smelt like that for years and probably blew that smell in everyone's face every time you spoke lol 
    i feel very fortunate that my wife and i are quitting together....i can only imagine how hard that would be. even if sarge says it doesn't matter.....hahaha     
    Lilly, I'm somewhat a freak when it comes to smoke. I hate the way it smells, that's one of the reasons I quit, after all those years. I was tired of always having to try to hide it. Gum always, cologne on almost all the time. Most people never new I smoked , this coming from them. I am not going to be one of those ex smokers that bag people that do smoke . My point was it is hard for me to to be in a vehicle that smells of stale smoke, smelling smoke on my wife is hard no matter how hard I try. I noticed it when we both smoked. I just hate it more now than ever. I will get over it or used to it, but do not have to like it.  would rather be like this than smoking again. That I never want.

        Daddy, did you love your cigarettes More then you loved me or did I do something wrong? I wish you could have seen my dress Mommy said I looked so pretty.  You could have pined my flowers on  The night I went to prom    Daddy, did you love your cigarettes More then you loved me? Mommys got a new boy friend She says its to hard to be alone.   Are you lonely daddy or dose Jesus  Keep you company ?  Daddy did you love your cigarettes  More then you loved me and mom ?    I wish you would have walked me down the isle   And brushed away my fears, told me no matter what   I would always be your little girl. Daddy did you love your cigarettes  More then you loved me? His name is Jacob ,just like you    His eyes sparkle blue in wonder Why dosent he have a grandpa    To take him fishing or to the zoo   Like all the other boys do  Did you love your cigarettes daddy  Were they really worth it - all that you’ve been missing?

    Bump in honor of jwg, RIP
A lazy Texas river spanning form Kerr county Texas to the San Antonio bay on the Gulf of Mexico.  If you ever need to find a place to relax enjoy the sunshine while refreshing from the hot Texas sun, nothing beats a lazy day tubing down the slow winding of deep greens and blue. Some place your arm able to reach down and feel the stones polished by the millenniums. Hiding secrets of the Alamo and days gone by. A sacred place, where no worries in the world can follow, No troubles from work are allowed to enter, only you and your desire to be at peace can break the waters edge.       In my resent ventures over this past summer I had the opportunity to experience the river , its majesty and glory , Not only was I with the river I was with the finest people in the world to share the experience. By day floating lazily carefree and by night telling stories lounging about the cabin or sitting under the stars on the porch, cooking out burgers some night or fajita’s..            I often think of that trip and the fun we all had, to go back in time , even in memory can be so nice . Some days we would float solo or holding hands keeping close together. other days we banded are pack together by twine and traveled the river as one , like a Robin Hood and his merry men , or maybe Tom Sawyer and some of his boy hood chums.        One particular day we were going solo , but I lashed the tube with the cooler to my rig 6 hours or so , surly you need some sort of refreshment and maybe even pull up on to  a clear shore line for  a bite to eat.. And so we did. After lunch two of are young explores  Decided to forgo the tubes, swim a bit and comb the bottom of the river for secret hidden treasures,, Lost sunglass or the mother load a Iphone or other such valuable loot.        Now with no use for there tubes , the young explores piled them on top of the cooler . So there I was, in my tube tied to a stack of three tubes and a cooler. To which the wind had greater strength to control then the  slow easiness of the river current.  Some times I would find the wind speeding me along , while others the wind dragging me back and my group of merry band of men flowing down the river far in front of me.        While still enjoying the river the ride and the scenery I really had no control of the speed of my travel , to which side of the river I would coast. Sometimes the wind would bring me in to the tree line . Catching me on limbs and others casting me out into the deeper waters. Basicly I was at the mercy of powers much greater then myself..            As history repeats itself ,, this is where I find myself once more, only today laying in my hospital bed.   With each  day that passes more tubes are added to my burden, and now with each tube the wind carries me faster down the river then we could have ever imagined.        Just a few hundred yards back the option of chemo loomed in the air to slow the winds and the current giving me more time to enjoy the river, but now once  more due to powers beyond my control I find myself helpless. My illness grows faster then can be controlled.        I am at peace, I am comfortable. I am in my tube enjoying every last minute of my ride  Down the Guadalupe      I can not see the end to the river nor do I look forward to its end..       I have my friends , I have my family , I have you all , and I have the love of a beautiful women , my angel, my everything to comfort and care for me       I love you all          And will to my best keep you posted         In the mean time        Don’t put things in your mouth and light them on fire !!
    This was one of my favorites of his.
    Mine too @despair not
    It is soooo beautiful and I love reading it. But it does make me cry  
    So nice to read this again, thanks Jillar.  I see some other treasures have been resurrected - thanks!! 
    I read this with tears...   He was special.....

    I am so pleased..jwg...posts can be brought here...x
    thanks for sharing!  I really miss his creative posts and our chats....he was a very unique man
    Sadly a bunch of his posts weren't archived by the way back machine and are lost for now. Hopefully his daughter saved them all before qsmb went down....
    Jill! Lol what happened to qsmb?

By the color of his salt and pepper hair I would have guessed him to be in his mid 50’s I would not say he was overweight , but a few walks in the park would not be the worst way he could spend a little bit more of his time. The biggest impression he really made on me was how , unimpressionable he was . If ever there was a John Q. Citizen this would be him. Everything about this man was average, from his shoes on his feet to that look of bewilderment on his face. Normally I keep to myself, Im not one to go around offering free advice. But I must say, he looked so lost- not that I had any answers. But perhaps I had the right questions or at the very least I had time to listen.    I placed the butt of my fishing pole on the walk and set the drag to loose. Then testing it with a tug , to make sure I would not loose my rig , if I were to get a bite. I walked down the bridge a few paces to where “john” sat on the rail. I was not even yet close enough to offer my hand and introduce my self , when that old familiar smell of stale smoke and tobacco hit me in the face like a brick.. “wow - this one is ripe” I thought to myself.    “ hows it going” I asked as I stepped in closer. “fine” he answered in a nonchalant way That’s , good I said nodding my head in affirmation.. “ you ?” he asked. “I’d be better if they were biting”. “ I imagine so” he said as he jumped down from his perch  “ you from the other side ? “ he asked. “sure am” I boasted with some pride “been over here for past two years now” I love it I added , I could never imagine it being any different. “ yeah” he said in a smug tone “ I hear life is perfect over there , it never rains   And life is roses all the time” Hog wash on that I said. “ we all got ass crap days” no matter what side of the river you live on   Really ? he questioned ,, “sure” I said.    What about money he asked “ I hear tell everyone over there makes more money”   “ Oh my goodness , who have you been talking too ?” “ no one in particular , A guy just hears things you-know”  “ Well I can assure you non of us make more money then we did before crossing over. Now we just have better opportunity’s to save some of it, or spend it on things we once wernt able to, things that make us truly happy” “huh” he said looking over my shoulder off onto the other side; trying to get a peek as to what life might like be living on the other side “your scared of crossing?” I asked. He then turned his head back and looked down the river, then he looked left; back in the direction he came from, then he looked down to his feet and in a small voice “ yes” he sighed  Slowly he lifted his head and said “ Im scared if I cross and don’t make I will have to go back home a failure” “ Im scared if I make it I could loose some of my friends, or even loose myself, and who I am”  “Hmm , I see , these are great concerns” I said I understand your dilemma. For a few miniutes we both stood there in silence looking down the river. He nervously kept his hands in motion as if he washing them in some imaginary sink.    After thinking a min or two I said to him   “ you know, if you don’t cross over to the other side your guaranteed to fail yourself “ but more importantly. I added “there is a secret to making it on the other side that the ones who never cross over can ever learn” “really ?” he asked “what is the secret can you tell me?”   I smiled and put my hand onto his shoulder , looking him in the eye and said    “ No one that has ever truly wanted to make it on the other side has failed. Its only the ones who question there decision and wrestle with the though of going back “ that ever fail . You see I explained , “when you cross over you can not live on both sides of the river” Then off in the distant we both heard a great noise, the sound of fireworks and celebration,    “whats that” he asked”  “oh that.” I said is Just some one that crossed over some time ago , having an anniversary party.   “wow” he said , “ that sounds nice, I think I would like that”  “yes… yes, you would” I assured him.    “ there is so much in this world , you have been deprived living back there in the darkness”    He smiled and said to me “ I think I’ll try”    I smiled back to him and said “ leave “try” here on the bridge , or throw it in the river.  The the path to freedom can not be walked with hope , each step has to be planted with confidence , leaving no room for doubt”
    WOW! 
    I will try to get more over here from jwg. He touched so many of us with his writings.....

    Jillar      Well done for recovering this. Thanks

    That’s a beautiful story and one that portrays a quality of both Quittrain and late QSMB: support. Support, help, understanding, no preaching and judging. 
    Bump 
Taking a couple of cigarettes to the patio with me was the way I could get through making an unpleasant, yet obligatory, phone call to a person who is toxic for me.    I'm about to make that phone call again -- to wish her Merry Christmas -- and the minute I picked up the phone to call, I started a deep craving for a smoke. Or six.       In the back of my mind is the memory of a few posts by various successful quitters that there will be situations that you come up with for the first time since quitting, and you (I, we) have to learn to cope with those situations without a cigarette. And here goes.... dialing...     I'm on that call now and  I'm sitting here typing a boring post instead of smoking.     This person is confusion on steroids.  It's catchy. Takes me a week to regain my own emotional equanimity.      OK, whew. Over. I was a bit impatient. Thoughts kept returning to having a cigarette. Hopefully I was kind. I think I was. Only 12 minutes. A record short call. Usually 20-45 minutes.     And I made it without a cigarette.  Sigh of relief.     On to the ice cream. I'm in need of a dopamine hit.
    Well done Kate 
    Well Done, went in with a plan and it seems to have worked, good for you!!!!
    Another major trigger anticipated, battle waged and won! That's one you'll never have to fear again because you know how to handle it without smoking.  That's how our permanent quits are built - one battle at a time; fought & won  
Might I ask -   If this person is toxic, why not cut ties? I mean dealing with her is no better for your mental health than smoking is for one's physical health.    Edited December 26, 2018 by Jet Black
    I had a similar issue for years and the toxic person was a sister who wanted nothing more than to drag everyone down to her level of misery in life. It was almost impossible to get off the phone with her without being simply rude and hanging up. When it comes to family dynamics, it's not always so black and white as just cutting someone out of your life. In my case the issue resolved itself when she died.
I get the obligation and not being able to just cut this person from your life.. you should be so proud of yourself... you spottedd a potential issue, you went in with a plan... you did what had to be done and you did not have a smoke. What a great feather to add to your quit cap... super effort and your only in week 2... good signs young lady.

It would be too unkind to sever all contact. She intends well, she's tried for years to change her behavior with professional help. She has had clinical depression for decades--well before there was competent therapy or drugs for it. She is nearly 90 now, so she won't be around for many more years. I would regret it for the rest of my life if I did not show her kindness.  I've declined to talk about some things, telling her that these are personal and I don't want to share. She's slipped a couple of times, but she tries.

    quitting smoking is a Journey           and another short about addiction   Here called, Nuggets.    
    Cool.   One is too many and a thousand is not enough.
    These little vids helped me.        When I first quit, I really wanted to know how long this was going to take. I didn't understand about addiction but,    as time went on....as time goes on  I understand more about the journey and as long as I stand strong with NOPE,    I need never be a junkie again.     So, please.  you beautiful smoke free creatures, have patience and determination.   You will be rewarded with a myriad of delights.

    EVERY time I see the nuggets one... it reminds me never to go to that place again.

As silly as this may sound... I just found out that there is (enjoyable!) life after quitting. For the first time in well over 4 months Ive had a quiet, all-by-myself evening with wine and a movie and knitting and a cat. Not one second did I feel a void or the need to fix something. Everything was ok, just the way it was. Including me.   Awesome.    Ticker says Im nearing 70% of half-a-lido-deck. Bank account states I saved over 800 euro's. Calender tells me it's only four days to 2019. After what I would like to call Uhm (Unexpected Hell Month) I'm even steadier in my quit. My non smoking didn't cause any of the events, so it would have been silly to light up. No causal link there.. just associations I continued to break.    Concidering a forever quit ...? Take the leap.  Like many people here I dare say.. if I can quit, you can too.
^^^ I love it when I read something like this that tells me ..... Someone has made it! They have finally realized that all the struggle has been worth it because they have found a life-long quit!      Congarts MLMR!!
    Huge step! Congrats MLMR!
    Super happy for you MLMR 
    I think this might just be my favourite post from you ever and you have had some ripper posts. So happy for you...and so proud of all you have achieved.

My first full year of quit was Oct 6th but my first calendar year will be of course Dec 31st.   One thing i have done for years is keep track of my spending. Two categories used to be "cancer" and also "dumb shit" (relatively needless purchases like entertainment stuff)      Of course for 2018 there was no "cancer". I noticed though at the end of this year, my "dumb shit" spending wasn't really much higher on average than previous years if i were to add my "cancer" and "dumb shit" together.     I kind of have a habit of using the excuse "At least it isn't cigarettes" when buying silly little things. I am not like some hoarder but there are a couple things I enjoy. Nothing that will ruin my health at least.     When you quit, how did your spending change? Did quitting end up being an excuse for other frivolous purchases or..?
    My spending changed for sure. More spending on clothes, pamper sessions, better hotels, better restaurants. Also saving more and still more money in the current account as well!!!! It's pretty amazing and a massive bonus to quitting. 
Thousand of dollars a year on smokes ... and yet there is no extra money by quitting.   It's all spent on travel to the world's premier climbing locations ... and climbing gear.   A much healthier hobby.     Suprisingly: considerably safer, too.   EZPZEdited December 20, 2018 by sgt.barney
    Quitting for me was never about the money..... It was about saving my two plates of meat ( London slang for two feet )...   But as time past I began to feel the benieft of health and money....    Going for a Mediterranean cruise in May....could,nt have done that if I still smoked ...your kinda limited when your feet have dissapeared.....
Spending has not really changed other than all the money I have saved since quitting (and as said before I have all that money at this time waiting until the 1 year anniversary to figure out what to splurge on!!!).

I am just wondering, if I haven't asked yet - when your doctor layed that bit of news on you about possible foot amputation if you did not give up the cancer sticks, how did you handle that news?

I am tempted to ask how much but that would be nosy. And holy crap martian, I remember when you sent me a PM about coming up on your three month mark and the battle that may ensue. But NOW you have just two weeks, two weeks til you hit a SOLID YEAR. Congrats, I mean you might as well say it is done.     I never set my savings aside, i kind of dwindled it on other silly things but yeah now i think, "I should have set it aside". Would have only been about $500 (I smoked RYO so they were cheap) but anyways...

    My Heart did hit the floorJB....thats why I quit and stayed quit....no romancing the cig here....!!!!!
But my spending changed, I bought the good cuts of meat..... I bought the fancy ingredients not the home brand.... and when I was unemployed for a few months there I managed to make $5000 support me, a kid, 3 dogs and 2 cats for 4 months and pay bills too.... if I had still been smoking well probably not,
    JB if you look at my ticker it is pretty close to right, a couple of hundred more.  Guess this is a good problem to have trying to figure out what to do.
I know.... you could come to Aus to visit me and CbDave! So lets just say its about $3100 come the Lido Moment... in Aussie money thats $4,403.66 ... allowing for the transfer fees.... or you could have a real Lido Cruise moment.... or you could do some renos to the house and every time you look at them you could get that kick of pride because your tenacity and determination lead to that... well done buddy...

    Oh I know... by yourself a very expensive watch and then every time you check the time you will be reminded just how you earnt the watch and it will be yep.... not smoking is good.
When I quit (and previously as a smoker) I rented my place. The next year I bought my own house, and what I paid for in rent + $ that I spent monthly on cigarettes = a monthly house mortgage (including insurance), with change to spare.     Able to afford being a homeowner. It's one of the top of 5,325,263,902 reasons to quit smoking.
    Let me ask my wife how her spending habits changed once I quit smoking. I'll get back to you on that.

What I've saved for the past two weeks (since Dec 12 quit)  will cover what I will lose in pay next week. I am taking unpaid vacation time to visit my new granddaughter back east (USA).   When I think of smoking in terms of hours & minutes of work per pack of cigarettes....disbelief.    Normally, the money will go to my retirement account.

    ... YOU STICK ! I'm layed I in hospital, have been since Sunday, having tests.  I had a TIA, in short a mini stroke.    Came on fast and left me without any lasting damage ( thank God).   Still have to have the carotid arteries cleared in an OP on Thursday as they are blocked.   And the cause. I miss out on the high blood pressure, bad diet unfit etc, and manage to tick two boxes  Male and    you guessed it .....an ex smoker!   Damn it.... but I'm over it now.... I'm of for the OP on Thursday.  So I might be missing in action for a few days. Chris        
    Im sorry Dave, but its nothing major thats good. Try to get in shape. I tell you walking is addictive as hell and you get toned in no time, plus the health benefits. Eat better too? Good luck. 
    Bloody hell Mr Stoic .... you frickin been in the hossy since Sundee an ya only just tellin us now!!!!!!  Typical Aussie male too... Oh I just had a TIA... only a mini stroke... off to the OR on Thursday, blah de blah de blah blah, get the pipes cleaned.... Frcuk a Duck mate that's some serious shit. So will be keeping you in my thoughts on Thursdee... sendin' healin vibes and all that good stuff.... Shell Chocolates always speed up a recovered  ...... seriously get better soon and get back online because I don't want my days starting without a G'day.    
    Get Well Soon.      It's a stark reminder of why we should never smoke again.       I can't help but wonder whether the outcome would have been quite so promising if you hadn't quit.      Hope you are home and back to full health very soon.
    Sorry to hear you're poorly Dave  Luckily they seem to have a handle on it and it was not as bad as it could have been. Wishing you the very best in your OP and recovery. We will make sure the NOPE thread gets fired up daily until your return  
    Sorry to hear this Dave! Hope they get you back up and running soon!    Also thankful for your solid quit; knowing that being a non-smoker will make recovery easier (and you won't be tempted for relapse) Take it easy 
    Keep well
    Aw, damn, Chris !   This sucks. Wishing you a speedy recovery.  Check in as much as you can,    we do worry, you know.  Love,   S
    I hope you bounce back quickly Chris.
    Sorry about your TIA Chris  I've had a few people who have had one and they feel so much better after getting the carotid artery cleared. Glad there was no permanent damage!        
    Aww buddie...sorry to hear this ....dam cigarettes..... I wish you speedy recovery.... We,ll keep your seat warm ....
    That's really rough, Chris, but I'm so glad you got the warning shot while there is still time to correct the problem.  Nothing fun about surgery, though, so I'll be cheering you on and wishing you a quick and full recovery.  
    I'm sorry to hear this, Chris.  I wish you a speedy recovery.
    Chris thankfully you are doing better now.  Best wishes for the upcoming OP, do well -- you will be in my prayers....
Chris, sorry to hear this....It is good you are an ex-smoker going in for surgery, remember that!       I had several tia's and then a stroke in 2017 that landed me in hospital...where I then started my quit journey. I opted for the stent over the roto-rooter chemical clean out of the artery...and watched the whole op while it was happening! Did feel better afterward!      Stay strong, will be thinking of you!
    Whishing you well and hope to see you back starting the nope-thread soon!        
    Get well soon Chris. (try to milk it for all its worth as well ) 
    Hope you feel better soon, Dave.  Smoking is truly the gift that keeps on giving.  As much as we like to think that our body has recovered, some damage is probably longer lasting than we realize.     I keep wondering if we could successfully quit now then what kept us from quitting earlier.     Hope to see you posting here soon.
It's Thursday in your neck of the woods Chris.  Hope your procedure goes well and you feel back to 100% soon.
    Hope all went well....speedy recovery .....
    Hope everything went well with the op Dave, wishing you a quick recovery.   Take care 
    Good to see you here Chris, hope everything went well and you're feeling better already 
G'day   Got rid of the drips and drains. Drugs out of the system so it's safe to say something now. Got a cracker of a scar running up one side of my neck. Kinda looking foward to getting the matching one on the right.  Gunna tell everyone that I got bit buy a shark. I got away before he could close its mouth......    Can't let truth get in the way of a good story...   CEdited November 23, 2018 by CbdaveSpeeling

    Glad to hear you are recovering, Chris.
Hello,      So sorry to see this has happened, please let us know how you progress with the recovery.       It could have been worse - be glad that you quit 3 years ago, it could have been the difference between death and surviving this.       It is never too late to quit smoking.           Cristóbal
    Rooting for your speedy recovery here Chris. 
    Lol!! Glad everything has gone well!
G’day all   Thanks heaps for all your best wishes... I’m not just saying this it’s really raised my spirits.    Ive got some colour in my cheaks it’s really noticable how good you feel with a head full of oxygenated blood!  Managed to get the yellow iodine out of the beard and its back to a proper silver again. As for the bad trim, it will grow in time. Spiritually, it’s knocked me around a bit more than I care to admit. Over the last 8 years I’ve been operated on for 2 major injuries, I’m a 2 1/2 year cancer surviver but this has been the hardest.  I think it’s coming back from being semi paralysed down one side with a foggy head that scares you. As for not smoking. My doc said great, even a recient non smoker, he could work with that. Being a 3 year non smoking better still once those carotid arteries are clear they’ll stay that way. As for my heart trust me they have had a captive patient and every test shows those arteries are clear. My medication is one low dose aspirin and one statin per day. Don’t know if that will change when the other side is unblocked.      Back to just a couple of days work next week, ill ease back into it.....    Really pray that no one has to go through this. It’s no fun, if never wish it on anyone.... just read about it... trust me  Chris
Glad your recovering physically.... and spiritually.... I had to giggle at the iodine stains on ya santa beard.... and do i get a gold star for not stirring on that fact..So how many Tassie jokes are you copping??? I am sorry its rattled you so much but having paralysis of one side, however short term, would throw anyone for a loop. You, me mate, are a survivor.... you beat cancers arse, you kick the nicobitch to the gutter..... and this too will be chalked up to yet another steller Chris victory.... and how proud and rapped were you to hear the doctor being so happy with your 3 years smoke free status.... one more set of pipes to be cleaned and you will be like a new man.... not that there was anything wrong with the old man, we kinda like him.... but clean pipes have to be good.     Don't rush the back to work... although I get the fact it makes it easier to deal with other stuff when you have something else to occupy yourself.     So spirit lifting... yeah it sucks, yeah its scary, yeah you had already done the right thing and been through a health crisis so its kinda unfair... but your still here, your healing quicker than smokin' Chris would have, and you will heal better than you would have..... and someone lurking is going to read this thread and think shit... imagine if that happened to me, now, as a smoker... and it may just be the final straw that convinces them that now is the time to quit... because everything happens for a reason, even if we ourselves never know what that reason is.        Hope ya back to fighting form soon... just like your fellow Bananabender Horn.... just treat this health concern like an annoying Mundine... Edited November 30, 2018 by notsmokinjo
    Gday Jo Your very right you know. I should really be acknowledging how much giving up smoking has given me. In reality I’ve given myself a pretty special gift in given up smoking. It’s given me so much more than smoking ever did. Truly the gift you can give yourself that does keep on giving...  On the subject of my beard your correct it’s not a Santa beard, it’s actually a Ned Kelly beard just mine comes in white....    C
    I am so relieved and very happy to hear of your recovery.  Thank you for keeping us in the loop.    Saz
    Wow, cbdave, I just checked to see what was up here at quittrain after being off for awhile. Sorry to hear you got hit with this. That must have been really scary to go through the TIA and the treatment.     I have been well since my episode with lung cancer but I do have side effects from the chemo I had after surgery. It's also a 'gift' from smoking all those years. So happy we both quit and became long term survivors and quitters.       I still get the odd twang of missing smoking and that's why I checked in. Thanks for posting your story. It's a great motivation to quit and stay quit.
    Get better soon Dave and go whop that shark on the noggin

    So what does a Chinese general, military strategist, writer and philosopher of old and smoking have in common?      I'm currently reading his book, aptly titled "Art of War" and one of the quotes have struck a chord with me as being quite relevant in the daily battle we have with our quit. The quote goes thus: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.      From the time I joined this forum, everyone who welcomed me gave me the advice, read up, know your addiction, know what nicotine does to your body, know how you react to the initial days of your quit, drink up on the knowledge.     And I did that...not saying it was all smooth sailing, but it sure helped. The thought that I'm actually cleansing my body, and the nicotine is desperately trying to keep it's hold on me helped me grit my teeth and work through the initial days. Even now, whenever I've had those nasty triggers, I've come on here, and been reminded of the fact that it's not something my body needs, but something my mind is tricking me into thinking I need it.       Know yourself, know your addiction and you will not fear the result of a hundred battles.   May you always be victorious in every battle you enter my QT family.        Merry Christmas!!!
    What a great quote Tammy, and so fitting. Thank you and Merry Christmas to you too xoxo

    Great post Tammy    Know yourself ,and know your addiction, and you will not fear  the result  of a hundred battles ....    Love this !!!!  So well said ....knowledge is your weapon ....
    That's right! You get it Tammy  
    Wow Tammy those are very powerful words and another quote to add to my fridge.  Merry Christmas to you also.
    Newbies ...middle newbies ....anyone who needs  support ...before you smoke ....post a SOS....  There is always  someone here ....  Merry Xmas. !!!!
I am 100% sure I will get through these days smoke free. Still, the nico-b*atch is screaming like a madman.         Going to be so so so sooo proud when all this is over (not a huge fan of christmas). Another milestone will be mine to celebrate!
    Good work ....of course you can do it ...after all its just another NOPE Day....and so on .....
    AHHHH....The Holidays.  Hope everyone is OK and NOPE-ing their way into a brand new year.   NOPE-ly yours,  S
    HALT is definitely my first go-to now when I feel the tide coming in with a wave of a crave.    H, not really, but I ate ice cream. That can't continue. "A moment on the lips, forever on the hips."   A, nah  L, my dog is enough company, plus I have a lot of social contact at work. Solitude is a relief....but then I want to smoke. T, not tired, but I'm going to end the night because all I can think of is going to the store for a pack and smoking a few.     What stops me is a chance encounter with a smoker earlier today. The smoke halo around him wasn't totally disgusting, but it was not pleasant, either. It did make me want to smoke. I knew it would taste terrible, but that never stopped me from smoking before.     No, I need a longer list of distractions for when I'm low on energy but it isn't time to sleep for the night. Took the dog for a walk, but it's cold and rainy (Seattle weather), and all she wanted was to get inside where it's warm.     Bored. I'm bored. And lethargic. It's close enough to tired that I'm saying good night. Because I forgot once to pledge in the morning, I'll pledge tonight for tomorrow.   And tomorrow I'll come up with a few things I can do when I'm craving but too low energy to repaint the house or scrub floors.      No doubt there are ideas from you all floating around here in posts. I'll take a look on my next day off.
    I heard Mary Poppins used to smoke. Instead of NOPE or HALT or SNOT or whatever, she used to say - Supercalewhateverthehellitwas.    
    My distractions were staying glued to the boards whether it was reading, posting, replying to posts, celebrating milestones and especially socializing and playing games. It was a great way to keep my mind busy and off the constant craves. 
    As Jillar said, coming here and posting, reading all you can and then some and playing games was a great time waster and .... it educated me about this addiction. Romancing the cigarette is a big no-no because it perpetuates all the lies that our addiction has told us since we started smoking. Thinking you can have just one is another big no-no. That leads only to relapse.     Instead, look at the reasons why you originally quit and all you have invested in your quit to date. It's an incredible effort that has huge value so why would you ever consider throwing that away? Anyone can choose to smoke; that's easy but only people committed to a better lifestyle can quit. It takes commitment, perseverance, and time to get there but it's available to anyone who wants it.
    When I read the words ..Take smoking off the table ...no matter what the hell is going on....my junkie brain clicked ...the only  way to quit successfully...is too never smoke again . No matter what is going on around you ....sometimes it's hard....but always doable ....
    I used to love just sitting for a spell and thinking or reading a serious book (psychology, business management, self-improvement, etc). I've been attempting to do that this morning, and even though I'm wearing a patch during the day, I feel a hunger for a cigarette.  I'm fidgety.   For now and for a while, I can't sit in a comfortable chair and free-think, let my thoughts flow while my mind is in a semi-meditative state. Images and emotions of smoking interfere with thought freedom.    Keeping my mental guard up, pushing away the smoking images and desires takes effort and takes me out of any quiet-mind thinking.   It's a wee bit annoying. Frustrating.  It's tiring.      
    Hang in there Kate, what you are going through is totally normal for where you are in your quit. The first month is by far the hardest and especially those first three weeks. So go easy on yourself and I promise it will get better and you will be back to loving just sitting and thinking again  
    Be patient Kate ....our bodies have a lot of healing .....  Specially when we have smoked for Decades ...it's used to having all those chemicals every so often ,every day....  It has to undo ...what we have done ....    Be kind to yourself ....quitting is a journey...
    Kate,  that is the tussle that goes on in your brain between your addiction and wanting freedom.  You have been through the tough part so keep going forward and don't look back.   Kate, I really love reading your threads.  You have such a propensity for writing.  Did you ever think of writting a book?  I think there might be a best seller in there some where.

You're very kind, Linda. My life is not interesting enough for anything about myself, I am not qualified enough at anything to publish as an expert, and my imagination wouldn't be creative enough for a novel.    If I wrote a book, the only person who would read beyond page one is my mother. And of course, she would be dutifully enraptured with it.
    Well, I have had three days of dumb and dumber installing flooring in my house.  I thought if I went to a reputable dealer, instead of the Home Depot, things would go smoother.  Needless to say, my house has been torn up for too long with Christmas next week.  I put the dogs in day care the first two days but decided to endure the third.  I can tell you that I am definitely on edge.  I have to put the house back together but grocery shopping was on my list for today.     Had made my list but suddenly thought of something.  Finding a pen in my house can be a real challenge.  They must be well hidden or the puppies love to chew them to pieces.   In the process of trying to find a pen, I was scrounging through a drawer and what would appear?  A darn cigarette! I have been feeling solid in my quit for a while now but I was surprised at the thoughts that went through my mind.  I actually thought about smoking it.  Just one.  Once it is gone, that is it.      I actually thought about this for a bit and then I got up and put it down the garbage disposal. I can say though that it was close.  I am a little shocked and disappointed at myself.  I guess it will never really be a thing of the past.  My quit will be something that will challenge me everyday.    For today, I did do the right thing.
Hey, don't be this hard on yourself! You are not even 6 months in yet. Of course something like that is gonna tempt you big time - no surprise there  You did the right thing and likely because you educated yourself here about what happens when someone thinks they can have "just one".     I say Bravo!! You done good     In a year from now, when you find a smoke, you'll just laugh at it. Carry on. You will make it!

    I agree with everyone Linda, don't be so hard on yourself. If anything be proud of yourself for throwing that damn cigarette down the disposal. You're in charge now! And I hope that your floors turn out beautiful even if it is taking longer than expected....
    Don't make me come over there with my frying pan....I have a Turkey to cook......   I'm proud of you my lovely chicklette..... You were tested...and you beat nicotine's backside.....  Give yourself a massive pat on the back.....    Believe me , if you had of smoked it ....you would be devastated .....and we would have all been very sad ....

    So there is a glass it has milk in it half way.... two people look at the glass.... one person says oh no that glass is half empty... the other person says oh look that glass is half full.... so these two people look at your challenge today.... on Ms Negative Nancy of the half empty glass says... I am a bad person I wanted to smoke.... But Ms Possitive Polly.... she looks at the event and says... How frickin awesome am I... I was stress, to the max, I had to be in two places at once, I had dumb and dumber invading my personal space and then I had that nicodemon in my ear telling me to smoke some skanky random leftover.... but I did not smoke, nope, nope, nope, I trashed that smoke... I stood tall.... I am a freaking quitter. Well done me!        Every month it gets better... but be proud of yourself because while this might have been a close call, and I can see it, I have had them... lots because apparently I had secret smokes stashed all over the house.... you answered with the knowledge you have given yourself and you said I don't think so and gave it in.

    Linda,  Be aware that random temptations or wild thoughts or craves     will come up during your first year of Freedom. They seem to come out of the blue and catch you unaware.    Please remember NOPE and hone your vigilance.   These are the last remnants of addiction,   the last neurotransmitters that haven't gotten the memo,    YOU QUIT SMOKING.   Great Work Today, gfriend.  Great work.
    Awesome Linda!! I can feel your your slight frustration lately. But I have to say you're a winner! Great job.
    Great job, Linda.       No reason to be disappointed.  As everyone else said, you're still fairly new in your quit and things will get easier.  The important thing is that you didn't smoke.  That is awesome.
    Looked at my face in the mirror this evening after work, and I had to look more closely....my complexion is a tad lighter or brighter, or something. It used to have a grayish tone that was really unattractive. Cosmetics didn't help much. Guessing that improved circulation is having something to do with better coloration. Is this common?
    Isn't it great Kate? I noticed right away that my hands and feet were so much warmer now 
    Yes! Blood circulation !!!   Congrats!
     Yes, yes, yes!! I have been told by many that I have a glow about me since I quit. I believe it is due to better circulation now. I loved hearing that...and it helped me in the early days of my quit when the craves were coming fast and furious!! I didn't want to lose my glow! 
That was one of the very first (and quite unexpected) consequences of my quit.  I really had no idea about my grey pallor until I began to see something very different emerging after a week or so into my quit.  It was eye-opening!  If you're like me, it'll be the first of many (ultimately endless) benefits you'll enjoy.       Christian99 17 Years Quit
    Yes is very common.  As said above your blood circulation is improving and will continue to do so.  Many more benefits to come!!!!
    My complexion changed too. Not sure it was a result of quitting the ciggies though?
When I first quit..... My number one Mantra...........Smoking is not an option Followed quickly by my 2nd Mantra...............No Matter What Don't get me wrong.....there were times I felt like a trapped animal with nowhere to escape, had the urge to pull my hair out of my head, cut and skin myself like a snake (no, i'm not a cutter), run down the street naked screaming at the top of my lungs...okay..that's a little extreme but I was damn near close.  But still...no matter what...I made the commitment to myself that I was never ever ever going to smoke again.  I couldn't think beyond that day of course...so I had to do this...One Day at a Time. There have been debates about this subject.  The ones who argued against this and said they are adults and don't like to be told what to do so the idea of taking the option away makes them feel trapped and then they want to smoke even more.  I say that's bullshit!  Ironically...the ones who fight against the idea of Smoking is not an option....Well...historically speaking...they are the ones who disappear and come back to say they relapsed.  Again. When you have a baby..the second he or she is born...you take one look at that baby and you COMMIT....for life.  No matter what...you are going to protect this child and nurture it.  Do you turn around 6 months later and decide...I don't like being told what to do...I feel trapped...I don't want to do this anymore...??  Most normal person with values and morals won't....it's not even an option....a thought....it's just Out of the Question.  It's absurd, right??  Well....no different here.   I even imagined the worst thing that can happen in my world....(i'm a mom and grand-mom so you can imagine what that would be)  just the mere thought of that makes me get teary eyed and want to vomit...but still I know...smoking won't change it or make me feel better...No Matter What....smoking is NOT an OPTION.  Whenever I had that crave...I just said..."Girl...do whatever you need to do...but smoking is just not an option so..think of something else sister"  I pictured myself on a desert island with no smokes in sight and I surrender to the fact that ...I just am not going to smoke because that's Not an Option.  Immediately I felt better...I relaxed...I surrendered....and moved on with my life...until the next crave..and I did it again.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Amazingly enough...I didn't die. I think if you allow the idea of smoking as an option to creep into your head even for a second....you are doomed to either struggle harder than you have to....and relapse eventually because it just becomes "too hard"  OR...you do keep your quit...but you took the harder way to get there...and not only that....the urge to smoke get's stronger..not weaker. Don't listen to that bratty voice in your head that says...I don't like being told what to do.  Because YOU are the one who made the decision to quit.  That's why you are here...that's why you keep coming back.  You want to quit.  The question is...how bad do you want it?  What are you willing to do to get it??   SMOKING IS NOT AN OPTION NO....MATTER...WHAT Make that commitment today!!
Second that babs, if you can't commit to NOPE or NTAP I don't think you are 100% committed to quitting, your just going through the motions.......
Brilliant post babs....there is only one way to quit.....NEVER take another puff....no matter what....What got me through the bad times....smoking is not on the table....EVER....x
Brilliant post babs....there is only one way to quit.....NEVER take another puff....no matter what....What got me through the bad times....smoking is not on the table....EVER....xIn turn you telling me that got me through... If smoking is not on the table then what can you do instead...and small battles were won, which turn into big victories!

My imagery has been of the store and a promise of relief of tension, but I didn't consciously recognize the picture in my mind. In fact, I've not really used imagery at all to help me with this quit.       I realize that I've been using phrases to help me with avoidance of smoking and plowing through cravings, but words/audio are not my primary method of learning: imagery/pictures are. I am very visually-oriented and dream in color.      It's powerful to mindfully focus on colorful images where there are no cigarettes around. I can imagine that store in gray tones and as not having cigarettes, or a big Mr Yuck sticker on the doors, or imagine a vacant lot where the store stands.       I really appreciate this post. It reminds me where my power to change comes from--imagining the result I want in mental pictures, not words.    Just creating some imagery to use when cravings hit will occupy my mind when I need distraction.        Thanks to Babs who wrote it and Paul 723 for bumping it.
Many successful quitters here on QTrain have quit on a whim and just like them, I quit on a whim too.This is what led me to making one of the most important decisions in my life on a whim... It was after a trip to California,  where finding a place to smoke was problematicand I was among non smoking friends.  For the first time,I started seeing addiction for the slavery that it is and I acknowledged my bondage.When slipping outside for another smoke, I glibly announced,"I'm going out now, to shoot up." On the aeroplane back home,  a colossal coughing fit overwhelmed me.I had to stand in the back while attendants tapped my back and brought me water.That was weird, I thought.  That was awful.  What was that about ? After landing,  I didn't rush outside for a smoke before climbing into a jitney.Something had changed.Instead, I  thought, why don't you try and quit....you already have 6 or 7 hours clean ?  Why not ? Let's quit smoking for a while and see how that feels.  I spent the next 72 hours sleeping a lot, drinking whisky and reading all about quitting smoking, all about nicotine addiction.After those days, as nicotine left my body, quitting became a wager with myself,  a bargain.  'If you don't feel better in five minutes...maybe you'll feel better tomorrow...if you are not feeling pretty good by next week...or,  in a month...see what happens after a year.'You can always go back to smoking. You know what that feels like. The thing was....I was feeling Free.  While I was beating a trigger or a crave....I was learning how to be Free.It was intoxicating !  It was empowering !That was where the whim became a serious enterprise.I realized, I would conquer any obstacle to my freedom from nicotine, it was just a matter of time and choice. Maybe you will quit on a whim.You don't need much.  Cool clear Water,  the fresh Air you breathe,  some Kindness towards yourself, and a Willingness To Be free.
Why wait...for all the nasty stuff... Or leave it too late...
I quit on a whim too! Even though I had tried so many times and failed. Use this forum, support from these here will make you stronger!!!

    bump for anybody  taking a chance on a whim.  Quitting smoking is a great adventure.
I am a planner extraordinaire.  Spreadsheets, calendars, reminders, graphs.  I planned at least 50 quits over the decades.      That being said, I actually quit on a whim.         I was so tired of going to bed wheezing every night and feeling shortness of breath.  One night, after my final evening cigarette, I said, "That's my last one. I'm done."  In the back of my mind I thought I'd last a maximum of 3 days.  That seemed to be my normal "quit" time limit.  I still, to this day, can't say exactly why this time I didn't start up again after day 3, or 10 or 100.  I just know that the longer I went, the more valuable my quit became to me.  I didn't want to throw it away, even when the cravings seemed unbearable.        Now I feel completely free.         So, I'd encourage anyone who decides to spontaneously quit to go for it.  You never know if some unknown factor will kick in and make it your forever quit.                                               ****** Of course planning, education, and support greatly improves one's chance of success.******
    Same here. Quit on a whim in the middle of a cold, damp winter after a coughing fit while standing in a parking lot on a Saturday. Quit the next morning and have never looked back. Well, I've looked back but I never went back 
I also quit on a whim (see my signature !!!). I woke up one morning, looked at the cigarettes on the table by my bed. I remember thinking I was so tired of smoking, and at that moment I made a decision to not smoke any more.        I smoked for 30 years, about 2 packs a day for most years, and had never quit, or really thought very much about quitting.      My quit was very easy. Too easy I think !!!     I did not tell my wife, who was also a smoker, but she realized very quickly I was not smoking and she quit a week after I did.         Her quit was very difficult, but now we are both quit for almost 6 years and still help others quit. In the internet, she prefers to help in Facebook, and I prefer to help in regular forums. We also both help others personally to quit.     For both of us, it was the best decision we ever made.          If you are still smoking, and think you cannot quit, keep reading in this forum. The real truth is that all smokers can quit, even you. Once you realize that smoking is really about nicotine addiction,  and get further education about it, your fears will disappear and you will successfully find the freedom you are looking for.            Cristóbal    Edited June 14, 2018 by Cristóbal
    Nice post. I used to wish I could quit on a whim. I made quitting out to be a drama. On reflection though I realise it could have been easier.       
    Addiction is a bitch, G,    Although my initial impetus to quit was on a whim, it took more than whimsy to succeed.  It took resolve and focus. In hindsight, most of us will realize we could have made it easier on ourselves but, we must remember this is a pervasive Addiction .   Once our resolved is established, it is just a matter of focus and time but getting there can be grimy. The voice of the addict is a seductive menace.      Congratulations on your quit, G. I look forward to your year celebration in the Fall.  
    I quit on a whim too. Smoked first couple hours of day and just said duck it.  Read a bunch and here we are.

I have quit on a whim many times. It typically lasted four hours.   I had to set up a more structured plan of attack to quit. Went from 30 to 3 cigarettes a day for three days then to NONE.   Not sure how well the step-down method works for most but it is what I had to do.
    I quit on a whim... kinda.... sorta... yep defo a whim... should listen to that little voice more often.... the one that says go on give it go.... I am so proud to say I don't smoke, I quit.
I was planning on quitting for a long time after 3 odd attempts where I failed. One which took me to beyond 3 months.       So one fine day when I reached work, I chucked my usual morning smoke with tea that I used to have everyday, and just had the tea.  And told myself, if you're serious, don't keep saying "One day". Make today "Day One", and that was it.     Well, it's only been 6 months, but I'm sticking to my quit like paper to glue.
I quit on a whim on april 1st because i kinda wanted to make it a joke and see how much i could endure. And hey i did it.       Nah i keed. We have to laugh too or else we go insane Edited December 21, 2018 by StewieTech
    Working my way through a craving.  HALTed, then stumbled on a post Paul bumped yesterday about dopamine-inducing rewards. I'm about to go to the grocery store for just such a reward.  I was debating cleaning the apartment   vs reading a book I just checked out from the library entitled, "Getting Things Done," (David Allen)    vs watching an episode of Criminal Minds on Netflix vs washing the inside of my car windshield  vs cleaning up the garden from dead summer flowers.     A light clicked on as I realized that indecision causes me to want to smoke,. It's a big trigger. BIG trigger. So I guess the take home message from this is that while I am doing one task, always have the next thing I want to do in my mind. Then I will not have so many pauses of indecision where I want to smoke while I am waffling about.     Speaking of which, waffles with butter and maple syrup would  spur the release of dopamine. And then I don't have to go to the store and elbow my way through crowds of Christmas shoppers. Pancakes would also be good.    But I'd really like to see what the pastry selection looks like today. Apple fritters would be good. With coffee. But then I wouldn't sleep well tonight--the caffeine.     Actually, I should really be out walking the dog. This is Seattle and it rains a lot, today is no exception. But there is a break in the rain at the moment.    But the dog is asleep and won't want to go out in the cold.     And there are pastries with my name at the bakery counter.      (You see how easy it is to be indecisive?!)
    I used smoking to avoid doing things I didn't want to do or just to put off those things I had no real interest in doing. Then again, I also used smoking after I did things to reward myself so it was a bit of a puzzle because I was smoking at both ends of tasks. Took a while to sort through all that stuff and become normalized again.
    I love what you are doing -- you are beginning to sense the triggers (big ones at first, then the smaller "uh-oh" ones.  Believe it or not you are moving in the right direction.  Soon those big triggers won't be so harsh and you can breeze thru them.  Good pick-up for you, moving in the right direction now!!!
    You're doing great Kate and any of those treats sound good to me 
I'm not sure the distinction matters that much, but I'd argue that your indecision is as much an effect of recovery as a cause of a craving.  I was extraordinarily indecisive and unfocused for quite some time in the early stages of my quit, and it would be wise to anticipate and plan for such symptoms moving forward.  Don't feel like there's anything wrong with the quit if these experiences persist--they're frustrating for sure, but not at all atypical.  Time is your friend in this process.         Christian99 17 Years Quit

I hadn't thought of that. It's helpful to know that this may be recurring for a while, at least.    When I felt indecisive, I'd go outside on my patio for a smoke and think about my options. I felt better, then I'd come in and act on my decision.  I'll work on a substitution thinking-break without the cigarette.  Goodness knows, eating  the ice cream I eventually settled on didn't help with making any decisions. All of my to-do tasks were still undone and the ice cream lost its appeal.  Thanks again; I'll think about this. And practice patience and mindfulness,
    Kate- you are still not smoking so you are doing FANTASTIC!  It may help you to think about the comfort that routine has given you. Most smokers love routine, that is why it is so difficult to let go of the cigarettes. So, replace your old routines with new, healthier, happier ones. If they are moving you towards your goal, then they are part of the plan. Stay the course. If you find yourself having so much difficulty with decision, you may want to make a calendar or list for yourself. I.E. on Monday, Wed and Friday you do this etc. Use this as a starting point for reorganizing yourself and then be flexible for the new experiences you will be encountering.     
    The addiction causes you to crave. This is the direct link that supersedes other thoughts or desires.   The addict wants their jolt of endorphins every half hour or so.    You succeed when you wrench your choice away from nicotine  and begin to really listen to your body and what your body requires.    (as in HALT)     
Indecision may cause you to crave Kate, but remember this.  You only need to be decisive on one thing.  DO NOT SMOKE.  Bit by bit your brain will become rewired and accept the fact that doing things without a cigarette is natural.  Keep up the good work.  You're doing great. Edited December 21, 2018 by BKPtypo
    Yes! Trust in what others who are quit for years say. It will get easier the longer you just apply NOPE to your daily life. It's not always easy and it doesn't always make sense in terms of how our brains were wired as smokers but the truth is ....... as long as you NOPE each and every day and live by that pledge; you too will be free of this addiction that only takes and gives you nothing good in return.
    Yes, I ask cause I am THAT bored...     Anyways, I am not an easily excitable person but when I do get such or if I am happier than normal, I find myself thinking, "A smoke would be great right about now".   The most common occurrence is when I learn that some sort of "bad news" isn't nearly as bad as I imagined.      It is weird cause i could be almost in a rage of anger and the thought of smoking is never there. Same for being sad or having the "Monday Blues".  But let it be something good like, "ALRIGHT! That neighbor I hate is being exiled to Pakistan to be sold off into slavery!" and my mind seeks nicotine out of pure joy and excitement.      Luckily the only time I normally get excited is when I find a fantastic deal on clothing.       What about you?          
    Probably because while you smoked you were conditioned to see it as a reward for having completed a task or while out having a good time or whatever brought you joy.   For me it's boredom. When every I have nothing to do and no real focus I think I should be smoking to use up that time I guess?
    Stress is a big one for me. It's likely that the stress I felt was because of a need for a nicotine hit.    When I was anxious about starting new in work I'd never done before, I smoked more. Being worried about learning the work fast enough caused tension. As I became more proficient, i began smoking less. 
    Absolutely nothing.     There is an end, folks, it does go away.    EZPZ
    ^^^^^   I agree.  Cravings are gone, kaput, nada.    
I can't even remember the last time I had a desire to smoke.        In fact, and this should not be mistaken for complacency on my part, I can't think of one scenario in which I would ever choose to smoke a cigarette again.         2 hours ago, sgt.barney said:               There is an end, folks, it does go away.                Yep, what he said.
(First Posted 01 April 2014)  A crave can happen because of 2 things:  1. Physical Withdrawl Symptoms. 2. Mental or Emotional Smoking Triggers.  Craves can happen frequently early in our quits, because of physical withdrawl symptoms. They can also happen simultaneously with physical cravings and then later in our quits, much less frequently, as we continue to confront triggers which are mental or emotional in nature.  The important thing to remember, is that craves are *NEVER* a command !!!  You N.T.A.P. them (apply to them the concept of Never.Take.Another.Puff.....just for today) as they happen. Then what happens ???  Nothing. Absolutely.......*NOTHING* !!!  Your head does not explode when you say "NO" to a crave. You will not die. Life will continue, and the sun will continue to rise every day.....and so will you....and the crave will be gone and soon forgotten. At the same time, you re-program you brain and emotions to react to life as a non-smoker again. Craves create F.E.A.R. in your mind and emotions, but it is a false fear. F.E.A.R. = False.Expectations.Appearing.Real. In the case of smoking, the expectations that some horrible thing may happen if you do not yield to the crave, are ***FALSE***. The fear that craves create can appear real, if you give them life and continue to believe lies the addiction may tell you, and can seem like a command at the moment they come to you. But the reality of this fear, is that it is a fear based on lies. This fear generates a false command....a empty command, based on the lies of a addiction that has no intelligence, is in every way illogical, and exists only as a ghost in your brain.   If you do nothing when you experience a crave.....nothing happens. Ever. A crave based on illogical F.E.A.R. - False.Expectations.Appearing.Real.....is never a command.Do not listen to the nonsensensical illogical lies the addiction may tell you.Instead, N.T.A.P. these craves, and N.T.A.P. your way to the mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual freedom you so desparately want.  Cristóbal
Your head does not explode when you say "NO" to a crave. You will not die. Life will continue, and the sun will continue to rise every day.....and so will you....and the crave will be gone and soon forgotten. At the same time, you re-program you brain and emotions to react to life as a non-smoker again.  Whenever a crave it gnawing at you, remember that every single person here and the millions of those who've quit smoking also said NO.  That horrible crave that's pestering you will be long forgotten so long as you keep saying no because over time (mine was short), they all go away...for good.
Thank you so much for this!  Just what I needed to hear at this exact moment.

Mental or Emotional Smoking Triggers.                                    Craves can happen frequently early in our quits, because of physical withdrawl symptoms.                        They can also happen simultaneously with physical cravings and then later in our quits, much less frequently, as we continue to confront triggers which are mental or emotional in nature.                                  The important thing to remember, is that craves are *NEVER* a command !!!                                   You N.T.A.P. them (apply to them the concept of Never.Take.Another.Puff.....just for today) as they happen.                     Then what happens ???                                   Nothing.                        Absolutely.......*NOTHING* !!!                                  Your head does not explode when you say "NO" to a crave.                        You will not die.                       Life will continue, and the sun will continue to rise every day.....and so will you....and the crave will be gone and soon forgotten.                       At the same time, you re-program you brain and emotions to react to life as a non-smoker again.                     Craves create F.E.A.R. in your mind and emotions, but it is a false fear.                       F.E.A.R. = False.Expectations.Appearing.Real.                       In the case of smoking, the expectations that some horrible thing may happen if you do not yield to the crave, are ***FALSE***.                     The fear that craves create can appear real, if you give them life and continue to believe lies the addiction may tell you, and can seem like a command at the moment they come to you.                     But the reality of this fear, is that it is a fear based on lies.                       This fear generates a false command....a empty command, based on the lies of a addiction that has no intelligence, is in every way illogical, and exists only as a ghost in your brain.                                             If you do nothing when you experience a crave.....nothing happens.                      Ever.                       A crave based on illogical F.E.A.R. - False.Expectations.Appearing.Real.....is never a command.         Do not listen to the nonsensensical illogical lies the addiction may tell you.          Instead, N.T.A.P. these craves, and N.T.A.P. your way to the mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual freedom you so desparately want.                                    Cristóbal                   Bump for our fabulous newbies who are stronger and more powerful than any damn crave or smoky thought.

Just checking in to say hello and let you all know I am still going strong with my quit.  It has been 68 days since my last cigarette.  I have been keeping busy working lots to pay for Christmas and doing lots of baking.... I love baking.

    OMG IGT.... so super happy to see you are still with us.... thought we had lost you.... hmmm... definately think there were missed woohoo drinks, so very sorry.
    Wow T, who has time for smoking when they are baking such beautiful muffins!  Another one just breezing through her quit without a complaint!   Washington is a little far for me or I would come have a taste.   You definitely have a gift for baking.  Let us know when you open you own shop, we will put it on or bucket list! Keep that great quit going!  
    Good to see you igt, what a great quit you have going  Thanks for the update and the sweets craving lol
I gained 5 lbs just looking at that stuff!  Nice one. Becomes part of your family's Christmas tradition which is cool
Great quit IGT(T).  68 days is amazing!     I'd tell you not to blow it on 69, but that would be contradictory (har har).
    Congratulations T!  That's great!
    Great to here from you IGT, glad the quit is going strong.  Now to cool down from the food porn -- Oh so Gooood!!!
Thank you all!!! Here is what I made today on my day off. I made two batches of these..... this is what was left over from the first batch and the second batch is in the oven as I type.   Lemon blueberry muffins with a buttery crumb topping, powdered sugar and a lemon cream glazeEdited December 19, 2018 by I Got This (T)
    Thank you for checking in ! I am so happy you built yourself a mighty fine quit.    s
That is awesome.  Over two months quit, there is no reason to relapse at this point. You made it through the hardest parts.

Maybe do something that people often smoke after but just forego the smoke.
    Who first coined the H.A.L.T. acronym? In the past three days, I've gained a whole new respect for using it to rescue sanity from the clutch of addictive thinking. If I have it right, when a person feels s/he is in the grips of longing for nicotine, it may not be nicotine, but something else. Wires get crossed.    It could be Hunger, Anger/Annoyance, Loneliness, or Tired.      I don't know how many times in the past few days I've "HALTed." Each time, well most of the time, I reached a satisfactory conclusion that I needed something else, not a nicotine fix. Although the nicotine fix would have been nice, too, were it not destructive, expensive, and pointless.     I used to reach for a cigarette when I was hungry. When I've HALTed, the solution I come up with most often is to eat a piece of fruit because I sense my blood sugar is low.   Once, identifying lonely,  I reached out to my son (a young man with a family of his own). He and I are close. He doesn't know I smoke, so I didn't talk about smoking, just used a brief interaction to supplant nicotine craving.     HALT is so simple, yet so powerful. Stressor --> few deep breaths to gain calm --> ask the H.A.L.T. questions and be open to the answers --> focus on the best response and take action     Anyone else have success using this method? Do you use it often?
    I use this often - maybe that is why I gained so much weight when I quit...always went for a piece of dark chocolate! Been trying to just drink water lately!! It does work well when you are doing battle with a crave because you need to think and it gets your mind off the crave..... 
    Great post Kate and yes I've used it too 
    The nicotine addiction is in the part of your brain that would normally give you rewards for taking care of yourself.  Eat some food - reward for taking care of hungry.  In from the rain - reward for not being wet.  Get some sleep - reward for not being tired.  Nicotine hijacks this part of your brain so it mostly functions like:  Smoke cigarette - reward no panic inducing adrenaline dump.  You are retraining your brain to work properly.  It's a healing process, so it takes time and effort.  You'll see plenty of posts that discuss rewarding yourself often early in a quit to correct what nicotine has messed up.  
I do not remember how it came up at work but I asked this younger co-worker if he smoked. He said, "smoke what?" I said tobacco.        He said he didn't and asked if i did. I said i did for 15 years but gave it up over a year ago. He asked what it is like smoking cigarettes.        I said it was basically like being in a watered-down state of being stoned, like being in a slight daze constantly. I then said, "Of course if you go too long without a cigarette, your nerves go ape shit".   He said something about hearing that this was the reason it is so hard to quit.     I was like, "Oh yes, quitting is a bitch. But you know, I just got sick of feeling like i had to have it, I was coughing all the time, clothes be stankin'. After a while i was like "F*** smoking, I am tired of dealing with the hassle. I don't recommend that shit to anyone, it ain't worth it."   I wonder if I gave him the idea that smoking sucks?     Oh and then tonight i went to pick up my room mate from work. I was parked in a spot across from some rusty ol pickup. Some grown man with his pants down and his ass in plain site was digging around in his truck. And then the smell of a 1,000 cigarettes hit me. Tonight it was cold and damp and s us smokers know, that kind of weather REALLY amplifies the stench of cigarette smoke.      One benefit of quitting smoking is we get to complain now about smokers and how gross it is.

    ^^^ The choice SHOULD be obvious but unfortunately it's not to many. We all spent years protecting our addiction as hardily as we now protect our quits.    The time for a serious quit comes to us all sooner or later. Hopefully sooner for those following in our footsteps

Feeling so awesome in my quit!!!!merry christmas to me as a non smoker!!!and merry non smoking christmas to ALL of you!!!
    Good to hear  And, Merry Non-Smoking Christmas to you as well!
    Great to hear you are feeling comfortable in your lovely Quit...    Wishing you a Merry Xmas ...and a Prosperous New Year xx
    Glad to hear parsley, and merry Christmas to you too 
    Yay Parsley !   It will get even better, bebe.  HO HO HO to your too.
    Parsley, you and I must be in the same place.  I feel the same about my quit.  Is this not the best Christmas gift ever.  You have a very Merry Christmas and a Wonderful New Year!
    Merry Christmas to you too, Parsley!  I'm glad you are feeling awesome.
    Merry Christmas Parsley, looks like you are doing well.  Enjoy the holidays especially that you are smoke free!!!
G’day   I have a quit... he’s 3. I’m very proud of him. Course I am, I’m a parent!  But he’s 3. He’s just a toddler. He’s curious willfull and ready to explore the world.  But there are dangers out there. My job is to protect. I’m a parent and that’s what I do.   I set boundary’s. They don’t just restrict. They give a protective zone for my quit to grow strong and experience the world. As he grows up against those barriers it time to loosen them and let him grow some more.   There is one that will never be lossened and that ones NOPE.    Not One Puff Ever.  Its a quit killer. Simple as that.  That line in the sand that can’t be crossed.    Like I said....     I’m a parent. It’s my duty  To Love
    LOVE ^^^^
    I love this too.  There is nothing more precious than a child.  To look at our quit in these terms lets us know that it needs to be held dear and protected.    The wisdom on this forum abounds!
    We are heading into that time of year and, even though I feel confident in my quit, I am a little fearful of the holidays.  They use to be such a great joy and spiritual fulfillment for me but over the last couple of years I have come to dread them.   My emphasis was always on having that loving memory that was going to be left behind.  What always occurred was more like one of those comedies you see at the movies.  I always got through by sneaking upstairs to the bathroom and having my smoke out the window.   Every year I start fresh with that hope and end with such disappointment.  I know you will all tell me to go away for the holidays but I can't.  I know my grand kids look forward to Grandma's homemade sticky buns and my son is single and does not have a family besides us.  This might be the last year with my dad.  His health is declining.    No one has the perfect get together and I am sure that even though things do not go as planned, we will probably still look back and find something good about them.    I know the longer I stay quit, the more powerful I become.  Maybe my fear this year is that I may be too outspoken for everyone.  I might just finally not put up with some peoples sh**t.  Whatever, I just wanted to get this out there as we head into the holidays.  You are all so great at redirecting my thoughts and helping me through.    .   
The holidays will be so much better without missed moments for smoking!!(and all the stress of thinking you could hide it)  You might need family around more than you think as you just experienced a close loss.  I know your parents make you nuts, so take your breaks still...make an excuse to go out to the garage and scream into a pillow...go out in the yard and see if you can find a good stick    Enjoy EVERY. SINGLE. MOMENT. with those grandkids and don't let anyone stop you from giving them all the love and attention they deserve. I'm a little sad I will miss out on the sticky buns. (your husband enjoys them the most, I bet)   Get sassy if you have to...sometimes people get used to walking all over us and won't stop until we stand up for ourselves. My mother in law is like that with her daughters and expected she could give me the same treatment when I married her son, but I set boundries real quick. Now, she doesn't "tell me" to do anything; she asks politely when she talks to me  The holidays are just another part of the quit...the things we have to learn to do as a non-smoker and we will do it together! Edited November 15, 2018 by c9jane29
    Sweetheart ,    With all the hype that leads up to Xmas....it easy to sit and reflect when things are not as perfect as we would like .....and wish some area,s in our life were different ...I'm with you on this .    I have learnt over the years ,to just except things ...and it's only a short time ...   Sometimes thinking about a situation makes our brains go in overload.....just stick to NOPE...you are a stronger person now.....one who will speak her mind and I know you will do just fine .. This is the first Xmas of many smoke free...that something to cheer about ...I'll raise my glass to that....
    Hugs, Linda, I know that holidays isn’t the easiest time and you’ve had tough moments recently. Just be nice to yourself and enjoy what is good. 
    Linda I wish I had some amazing advice but all I can suggest is to just roll with it.       You said "My﻿﻿ emphasis was always on having that loving memory that was﻿ going to be left behind." Just remember that whatever the adults do you are still building those memories for your grandchildren.     You got this        ﻿﻿
    Oh Linda, I know from experience that the anxiety leading up to the holidays is much worse than the actual holiday. Many others have said the same. Hopefully you will be pleasantly surprised at all the free time you now have to be present in the moment.   Stink free hugs for all, sticky buns (so jealous!). And hey, if you find the need for the new and improved Linda to speak her mind, GO FOR IT!  And lastly, you always have your family here to come and vent to 
    Linda, repeat after me.....ONE DAY AT A TIME! You do have the power now (you quit smoking!! Nothing more empowering than that, right?) and you will get through the holidays remembering just that! 
    The Holidays are much better smoke free

Ahhhh.....the horror daze/holidays  Expectations are on overload.   When you want to escape, escape and breathe clean cool air.  Slow down your breathing.  Remember HALT.  Feed yourself.  Rest well.  Let your feelings be feelings, give them attention.         Enjoy your grandkids.   Tell people you love that you love them.    Eat too many sticky buns.   Warm up your husband's bum. Play with your canines. Remove yourself from uncomfortable situations,  the door is always open.    Stand up straight, tits first, chin up. Un-clench your fists, lol.  Use your power. Communicate your perimeters.    Have FUN.   You don't smoke anymore.             Edited November 16, 2018 by Sazerac

I just read your check in Linda, what wonderful news that your son will be hosting thanksgiving in his new home  You probably won't even have one craving since you've never smoked there! When I bought my new car in 2007 I decided it would never have a cigarette smoked in it. So in my early months if I craved I would jump in my car and take a drive somewhere and the crave would disappear
    Sounds like you will have no trouble enjoying your first Smoke-Free holiday season! I would even say that you'll be coming here to tell us what a relief it was not to have to run off every hour or so to feed the beast! You are in for a real treat this year Linda - more time spent with your loved ones and a chance to show off the New You

He is 38.  He had his heart broken years ago.  I also don't think he will find a girl now because he has stinky ferrets as pets.     He has promised me Thanksgiving will be fun this year.  He says if Grandma gets out of line, he is going to let his stinky rodents loose!
You can do this!  I quit just 3 weeks before a Thanksgiving holiday, and just 7 weeks before Christmas, and looking back I wouldn't have done it any other way.  The confidence you've earned from being free of your addiction is a treasure, and sharing that joy wtih all of the folks coming to visit will make you feel great.  Enjoy everyone's company and quirks and let them pull whatever S&*& they want - stay enveloped in your happiness in being free Edited November 23, 2018 by JOD
Be sure to enjoy the benefits of your best holiday gift ever.....your quit !!!      Stay focused on being able to smell and taste your holiday food - think of it while enjoying every holiday meal, it will blow away any trigger thoughts that you may have.      Be sure to watch Joel´s video about the holidays:               Cristóbal    Edited November 24, 2018 by Cristóbal
    Hi @Linda Thomas, I was just thinking about you and hoping today went well 
11 hours ago, jillar said:              Hi @Linda Thomas, I was just thinking about you and hoping today went well  It went very well.  I actually did not have time for smoky thoughts the day of the event.  I do, however, find myself pretty crabby still, when I am under pressure.  Fortunately, my husband would rather have a crabby nonsmoker and still loves me . I do think it was a little more work having it at my son's home and I am really tired today.    My son spent all his time building his dining room table, which he finished the night before.  When my son is focused on something, everything else suffers.    Mom spent two days, going over to his house to help him organize and clean for the big event.  He probably will never have  cleaner toilets.    I did find it very hard relinquishing the turkey rights.  I laid in bed worrying about him stuffing the bird properly and it took every ounce of power in me not to get up at 5:00 a.m. and go over to his house to help him stuff it.  Everything turned out great.  Food was wonderful, and everyone behaved themselves.  One holiday down, only one more to go!  I'm attaching a picture of my son's table.  Pretty proud of that kid.  Lighting was not the greatest but I think you can see enough of it.  He now wants to build the chairs to go with it.  My elderly dad is at the corner of the table.  Brother-in-law in the doorway.   Edited November 25, 2018 by Linda Thomas
    Glad to hear you got through the day with no casualties.    the table looks amazing!    Re-training the brain...    Dont dread these events, instead embrace them and look forward to them as a non-smoker...it's something you need o be proud of...your family and friends are proud of you for it.   Well done!!  
    Wow !!!!    That is one mighty big table....it's fabulous.....  Well done for enjoying the time ....not really bothered about smoking....our minds are our worst enemies....always over thinking... You done it...the next one will be a doddle....high five Linda !!!!
    Oh I'm so glad to hear that Linda, and what a talented son you have. That table is gorgeous! 
    Oh, Linda,  I am so glad TGvng went well and your worries didn't manifest themselves.   The table is beautiful. (perfect to cut out fabric on !)    Is Son hosting XMas too ?       I hope you are taking time to replenish yourself.

    Yay for you, Linda! The empowerment you get from quitting smoking spills over into all areas of your life and is a wonderful thing!
    This is one of the greatest benefits of quitting yet it's one we never expect to receive when we start out. Good job Linda!  
    You have built a beautiful quit, Linda  and your strength and inner fortitude is an inspiration to all of us.   It was just under the surface but, gangster-ed by nicotine. You have blossomed, for sure    and the gifts you bring to the board are truly awesome. Thank you.  S 
Some quit on a whim, others quit making a sensible planand mapping it all out as best they can,there are many successful quits between the extremes.The important bit is the seminal moment in your life when you say,'I'm going to quit smoking'.       I spontaneously said,'I'm going to quit.If I don't feel better in a few days, I can always smokebut, let's see your mettle and give this an honest try'I had no idea the process took a lot longer than a few days.I had no concept at all about nicotine addiction.  I was supremely ignorant.     To be honest, it actually takes nicotine a lot longerthan a few days to completely leave your body.     Think about it...we have nicotine infested tar in our lungs clinging to our cilia.  Tar, ffs. This doesn't disapate in a few days.Ever have tar on your feet ?  It takes a solvent like gasoline to remove it.The miracle is that our bodies do purge themselves of most.  Still, remnants remain.  Remants remain forever in our DNA.A sobering fact.  After a few days, gathering more knowledge about addiction,I extended the premise of starting smoking again'if I don't feel better in ...days...weeks...'but some days, I thought, if I don't feel better in five minutes I can always smoke.There were many times when acknowledging the choice saved my quit.     My decision to quit smoking heldand my resolve to commit to this choice grew minute by minute.It grew by quantumn leaps every damn crave I beat.    I'm sharing this thinking about smokers on the fence,before the choice to quit becomes clear and non negotiable.You may not have a serious dose of resolve about your decision to quit.     Do not worry about this,resolve grows with knowledge and time.After a while there should be no turning back,you will know too much and will have power to commit to your decision.  The decision to quit smoking is one of the best decisions you can make in your life.            
        Great post Sally, thank you for sharing 
    Quit on a whim or plan a quit. Ive did both. Planning doesnt 'prepare' you. It just prolongs the inevitable. That scared, uncertainty you feel when you begin a quit... we all feel...whether planned or not. You never feel 'ready' to quit. You just have to go for it, with gusto!   I had seven planned quits prior to this on a whim quit, so i am all for on a whim quits. But know, of course, planned quits do work also. Horses for courses, we are all individuals. Just Not One Puff Ever! Make ya mind up and go for it!

Very nice post Saz that captures the essence of our early quit      I think many of us are the same Sslip! No clue at first and full of fear and trepidation over what will happen to us as we start out on this journey.   After a while, we realize hey, maybe we CAN actually do this because we are making good progress toward our ultimate goal.      You just passed your 6 month mark. Can you even imagine giving up all you have fought for to date - NOPE!Edited July 10, 2018 by reciprocity
    My only plan was to keep hold of my two feet ..that were in danger of leaving my body ,if I continued to smoke..    I had to make the decision ..keep the quit and feet...or smoke and amputation....   This is as real as it gets folks... Thankfully.. I chose correctly....

    Quitting....its not normally something you just happen upon by accident though is it sarge? A decision to quit comes before most quits, so nothing to be scoffed at.

You haven't actually started to quit at the moment you make that decision. Sure, some don't act on their decision but others do. Some, like you, me and a lot of others here, acted on that decision to quit and are still doing so. It really boils down to how badly you want it once you make that decision.
    It has to be a decision to quit...then choose to do it ..or not..   Your right millions make a decision, and don't quit..but isn't that thier choice to do nothing...   If I make a decision to make a cheese sandwich and don't...that's my choice... And I missed out on a dam good butty....  
    I certainly made the decision to quit   and made the decision to commit to my quit. Everyday I make this decision.  Everyday I stand by my decision.        Usually when thoughtful decisions take precedence over my actions   chaos remains at bay.   When actions take precedence over thoughtful decisions....  Well.  You.  Can.  Imagine.      
The rush of 2019 resolutions may be swirling around.    Quitting smoking and dealing with Nicotine Addiction is a popular one and ultimately do-able.   You can quit smoking.  We quit smoking and we are not special, just committed.      You will gain the gifts of self-confidence and trust in yourself.   It is a supreme gift to give your family and loved ones,  as well as yourself.  Nobody wants to witness or experience a life of nicotine addiction, a smoking related illness or a horrifying death.    Nobody. So, consider quitting smoking.  If you are a new quitter or an elder, protect your quit.  You have won.
I still get that sense of pride ...I quit .....I won....even after five years...    I beat the nico monster after 52 years .... If I can ...you can too.....what have you got to lose ...nothing ....but just imagine what you can gain !!!!
Or if you're like me and make your New Year's resolution each year to quit smoking but then break it, consider quitting before New Years and start 2019 as an ex smoker

Especially this part, above.      When I got my new job at a health food store, I said to myself that I'd quit when I started the job--we're strictly forbidden to smell like smoke.  Instead, I figured out how to not smell like smoke. (Elaborate, won't even go there.)       The new job came with medical insurance--tons cheaper for nonsmokers.   So every pack I smoked was definitely going to be the last pack. I was resolved, every time.  Months.       I opted in for smoking cessation coaching with the health insurance company so they'd know I was serious about quitting.  I knew the clock was ticking and I'd have to actually quit.   December 14th was the drop dead date, conclusion of the program.        December 12th I passed a trash can and tossed in what I had left of cigarettes.     What was I thinking?! Perfectly good cigarettes! I could have smoked for two more days!  Yes, seriously, what was I thinking?       You said, "you may not have a serious dose of resolve about your decision to quit."  That was true for me, I wasn't seriously resolved about quitting on the day when I quit; I was seriously ruminating on how I could keep smoking for as long as possible. For that day, I had put on a patch and was just going to not smoke during the day. I planned to smoke again that night. Just in case I felt panicked at lunch break, I had them with me in my purse. I'd remove the patch and smoke.      Now I've been through three days of refusing to smoke (nights don't count; I'm asleep). I've thought about starting up and quitting later. If I hadn't returned to this forum and posted, I know I'd have gone back to smoking. I'm reading through posts and being reminded of the great things I learned at the QSMB and Joel Spitzer's library, etc. It's great to find that wisdom through people posting at Quittrain. I think you're right, Sazerac. I think that as long as I stay here, keep learning and being reminded about being free of smoking/nicotine, resolve will grow, power will grow.  I'm not going to get complacent about having quit, I don't trust myself any further than the next few hours, but I do take heart with your post about a person reaching a point where knowledge and power make it possible to stay quit.    At this moment, I really, really (etc) want a cigarette. The only reason I don't have one in my hand right now is that I am typing this. And editing it. I need a doughnut.
Have a doughnut @Kate18, you deserve it  Quitting ain't for sissies that's for sure so take this time to spoil yourself. Listen to your body as it heals from all the damage done over the years. If it's tired, sleep. If it's hungry, eat. This is the time to be selfish and focus on yourself and quitting. What a great way to start 2019 right?!

I was going to sleep early to dispel disturbing intrusive thoughts.As I was making coffee, I had fearful images of something terrible happening to my children and theirs. Made me weepy.  Felt strongly motivated to go to the gas station and buy cigarettes."This is biochemical," I said to myself. Slapped on a patch.  Just deal with the stress of changing habits first, then chemical withdrawal. One step at a time. One day at a time. Until this patch kicks in right now, and my monkey-mind quiets down and stops projecting tragic images, I'm taking one minute at a time. I really, really want a smoke. Fortunately, I have to get ready for work.
    If taking it minute by minute helps ....then good ....  Please don't believe the cigarette offers you something ....it's the opposite ...it makes you more stressed ....    Please take the time Kate to read everything you can here....once you see smoking for what it really is and does to us ...the quit becomes easier...

It's a curious feeling, to have wanted so badly to smoke, but for once, I didn't.  I credit this forum for a lot of the strength I found to stay free of cigarettes Edited December 17, 2018 by Kate18
Didn't remember to put on a nic patch, so felt the full brunt of withdrawal today. The old panic returned.  To escape it, I slept for a while.  Just took another sleep sedative and my evening vitamins and supplements. It's not yet 6:00 pm, but I'm heading off to sleep anyway.        I I can just make it through today--historically the day when I've failed before--then I think I'll find the strength and resolve to make it through day 4 and on.  Have been dangerously close to saying "screw it, I want the relief of tension."  Staying on the QT and reading, watching videos for a while was a counterbalance on the side of health and freedom.     Thanks to those of you who checked in to the pre-SOS thread where I was working through, in real time, the cravings and the H.A.L.T. exercise. I appreciate your words of encouragement.
    Have a nice nights sleep Kate and when you wake up danger day with be a thing of the past that you'll never have to face again 
    How ya doing Kate ????  A new day ....a new NOPE...we all took it one day at a time...your doing great...feel proud ...your fighting that demon..   Make sure your kind  to yourself...nice Candle soaks...treats....it's so important ....plenty of  juice ....stay close ..

    Thank you Doreen 

There is such a vast difference between the board members. I put on my pants one leg at a time, reciprocity doesn't appear to wear pants.       You folks have been great. I'm not one for change really. It took me something like 273,000 smokes to figure out that I could stop. I really need/needed a place to vent/rant so that I wouldn't go outside and have number 273,001.        There is a common bond already between us, once we get to know one another you'll get to understand that keeping the coocoo inside the clock is tough with all of us :-)        I really do miss going back and reading some of the things that I used on the old board. My own posts from as far back as 2014 were some of my motivation for no wanting to ever quit again.        The people on the board are sometimes what helps me not smoke. Knowing that if I just come hear and write, and read, and read, and write, that enough time will have passed that I won't need a smoke. It is a very fragile thing for me, there were folks on Q that I used as mentors and there are folks that I want to help in their quit. It's therapeutic for me.  Something I finally came to terms with because of a few special folks is that I am a NICOTINE ADDICT. I can not help myself if I smoke. Not a single puff.      A little time, and a little trust, and we will be one big neurotic family who doesn't lite things on fire and put them in our mouths.       I wish you all peace in your quit   R

It is a shame in that it had such a rich history and was a thriving community at different points in time.

I personally think the new owners bought the name quitsmoking.com to sell their quit smoking products only and that there was nothing to gain by keeping the message board going. The store was updated and their products are sold through several different sites including Amazon. There is no need to maintain a forum in their view.   Like Johnny5 said we are very fortunate to have this site, provided to us by a former smoker, welcome us all no strings attached. I thank you again  Marylandquitter and everyone else who have welcomed us unconditionally.
    You know though, the tobacco companies hate forums like this. A place where even a few people encourage others not to smoke and KTQ. They hate it. Big tobacco loses money because of forums like this or any quit site.    So whether you are from QT, QSMB, or any other, we all have this in common -    We are, by NOT opening our wallets to big tobacco, telling them to cram it in their asses.
^^^^ This  ^^^^^        We are group of good people who refuse to be ruled by the big tobacco companies... Who don't care how many good people they kill...just to make money...    We are fighting the same fight...   This is us saying ...NOPE ..... 2 boards ..or 1.board....the fight is the same....  Quitting with a group is much more fun...

Another one who is made up to have found this place after the demise of QSMB. Glad to see many of the regulars from QSMB on here aswell. I joined QSMB around my quit day of 1/1/18 and was really helped by the site. Been struggling a bit this past week or two but still a non smoker, and still fully determined.      I'm sure my quit will get an added boost  now I'm back amongst my fellow quitters.
    Welcome tocevoD! Glad to hear your young quit is still in place  There are many old friends here and some new ones to make as well. The great part is, we're all quitters and here to help others. Buckle up your seat belt and enjoy your ride on Quit Train!

Hello, all! I'm so happy to have "found" you! I had a moment a couple of days ago where some smoking thoughts started creeping in and I got online to come to QSMB and found it wasn't there. I must say I was in a bit of shock. I then remembered Quit Train. So happy to find you all here! Did everyone know that QSMB was going away or did it just happen out of the blue? I'm just wondering if everyone over on the other site knew/knows about Quit Train? Does anyone have the 2017 Smokebusters logo? I'd like to put it back on my profile. Thanks and good to see you all!
Welcome Gigi...all the 'answers' to you questions ate on previous pages of this thread... Wuitbustets logo is on page 2.

    Did anyone use a program like HTTrack to make a copy of the qsmb at some point before it went down? I know that when it went down previously there was some talk of doing that for private use. Please pm if you have heard anything about this.

I am so grateful so many of you found your way here....I know in the first year of my quit (even 2) I would have panicked if the place I called home just vanished..along with my family on there.  I would have been so lost.  With the amount of people here from the qsmb, I can imagine it feels as close to home as can be and that must be such a comfort.  Plus....we have so many new people to get to know and join together in the war against nicotine addiction!  Love the energy here!  I am excited for the quittrain and for all of you!     a big HUGE welcome!!

I hadn't been coming as much and even though I don't think about smoking as much, I think I need to remind myself to come more often and to never really let my guard down. I lost another quit a few years ago because I became too complacent and fell into the "I can have just one trap". I won't let that happen again. Plus, it's good to keep up with everyone and touch base to see how everyone is. I always appreciate your kind words and your advice. Hope you stick around too!
    There is room for everybody here..all you need...is the desire to quit smoking...hold tight.....

    Welcome Kazza and Devo.  It is great to see you again!
    Hello, everyone! I was away when it was decided to combine QSMB with this board. So....I thought that the old board had been lost. I guess it is. I just found some familiar members names and realized that this was the place.        I have to start all over again. I was unable to locate my user name and password. Or did everyone had to get new passwords?         Well anyway, I’m here!      Im still smoke free! Hope everyone is well.  
    Thanks for the welcoming quit train!
I’m so confused. I was an original member of QSMB since 2013 and joined here when MQ created the quit train. I see some wonderful original members and a lot of new ones.       Cant believe QSMB was   lost so easily but so glad the beat goes on. Love to all of you quitters!       Betsy.
    I found it! I could NOT remember the name of the board that I was on before. I don't even remember my username there. I remember a lot of faces, uh names, here though. I wasn't there very long and obviously my quit failed.      Well, I'm back! 
    ^^^ I bump into some on here and also on social media, marcus angelina and nerdirl i havnt run into unfortunately, i hope they pop in here one day and hopefully all KTQ and doing well 
    There are plenty more carriages ....and seats...
    I am so happy y'all found us and grateful we all landed on a safe site,.    Thanks to MQuitter for the sanctuary, you are a hero.
    The saddest part (to me) is all of the posts from   jwg are gone. The only reason that I went back there every now and again was to read him. His posts inspired my quit.       I am so happy that you all found your way here.

Hi all! I too just discovered the site was gone. I'm coming up on 4 years smoke free and wanted to check in...but there was no site to check in on!!!!! Glad to see familiar names
    Hi MrsMelanie, glad you found the train. Congratulations on almost four years quit! 
    QSMB was awesome, I missed the people there
The train is fricking amazing... you will love it, hang around, give us a chance and enjoy the ride. When is your 4 year anni?
Welcome to QuitTrain, MrsMelanie.  Congratulations on almost 4 years smoke free!
    Welcome aboard MM....   Take a seat and enjoy the ride...there are quite a few familiar friends here...and you can make some new ones ...   I'm sure you will have plenty to offer our newbies ...  Congrats on your fabulous quit ...
Sitting with my coffee at my computer desk, but mentally I am wandering aimlessly, detouring around the furry little weasel in my mind that promises feeling better if I go out to buy cigarettes.  Two hours ago I was on the phone with my smoking cessation coach (with my health insurance company), talking about my strategy to stay quit. Oh, how quickly the challenge appears.     An observation I've made is that when I was hungry, I would reach for a cigarette.  (Apparently a common occurrence)    At the moment I feel an urge to smoke, so I ask, "am I just hungry?" Maybe. Not really, but eating would be better than smoking.        With this new eating plan -- plant-based diet, low sodium, and low gluten -- I have nothing left to eat in the house that appeals to me. Gone are the quick nachos and grilled tuna sandwiches. It's cold outside, so the thought of a cold salad isn't appealing. Cooking rice, beans, etc, takes too long.  (K'vetch, k'vetch)        That sneaky little weasel is popping its head around posts and pillars in my mind like a cartoon character and he's suggesting that all of this restlessness and aimlessness would go away with a cigarette. Then I could just quit again after I finished the pack.        Yaaaahhhh, nooooo, I've been here before. Saying, "yes, I'll quit, but not today," proved to not be a good strategy. On those other occasions, I went out and got the cigarettes, settled on my patio with a cup of coffee, smoked a cigarette, felt the relief from tension, and so reinforced the dependency on a cigarette/nicotine.         The furry, sneaky little weasel is cute, but I already have a dog and can't afford to keep another pet. On my way to work, instead of stopping for cigarettes, I'll stop at the Humane Society and surrender the weasel.  I'm sure someone else will give him a good home.   Edited December 14, 2018 by Kate18
Yes Kate, surrender that nasty weasel! May I also suggest that for the first few months you allow yourself to eat what ever you're craving. This addiction is hard enough to fight without throwing in a complete diet change. We especially crave sweets when we quit, and they help with the dizziness and spacey feeling you may notice. So I really recommend getting yourself at the very leat some fruit and/orfruit juice to help with those. Sucking on candies is also a great distraction from smoking as I never ate anything and smoked at the same time. I lived on those soft peppermint puffs. You're doing great and you should be really proud of yourself  Edited December 14, 2018 by jillar
    The iNco monster is playing with you...tell it to go and do one ...your not playing his game ...    You are stronger than him...    Be kind to you yourself....what you are achieving is wonderful...   Your body has alot of healing to do....
    I like your humor Kate.  The ladies on the forum kept me smiling through my first weeks.  You are doing great.  Just keep redirecting that crave.  
https://www.quittrain.com/topic/7166-riffing-on-halt/?tab=comments#comment-239005
    You know that that little bugger will tempt you ever chance it's gets so just fight it every time it whispers sweet lies in your head. Every battle you win, it gets weaker and you get stronger. Little by little YOU win!     Remember that ALL it promises you are lies. You said so much in your post here today. You know your addiction only cares about itself and not you so why even consider assisting it?        What does it really want? It needs you to feed it - yes, your addiction is powerless if you refuse to participate so tell it to piss-off!  These early days are uncomfortable - no question but only temporary so dig in and keep battling this A-hole because you know it's the right thing to do and we all know you can do it!
    Keep fighting through this, Kate.  It can be a tough battle but as long as you don't light up, you got this, and things will get better.

Thanks, Paul. It's exactly right and I'll put it on my refrig to remind me.
I have noticed a lot of people who hopped off the Quit Train jumping back on in the past few weeks.This is awesome.     So for those of you out there who in the past few weeks have tossed the smokes and taken up the challenge to quit again I just wanted you to know we have your back and are so happy that you have decided to quit again.Welcome Back.  May this be your sticky quit.   My you learn from your last quit (however short or long it was) and take those lessons with you to help you KTQ.    My you have a long future ahead of you as a non-smoker.      Edited July 11, 2018 by notsmokinjo
    Always this. Whether it is a slip or a relapse, if you are ready to go again we're here. Learn, share your experience and let's help one another fight the tough times and celebrate the good. 
    Dear fellow addicts,    There is no shame in failure, only an opportunity to learn.     Personal responsibility is one thing and you must, of course, own your success or your relapse  but, please remember we are dealing with ADDICTION which is outside most of our consciousnesses.    The first part of any successful quit is admitting an addiction to nicotine and we must learn and understand all we can in order to put it down.        According to The National Institute on Drug Abuse,  "Addiction is defined as a chronic, relapsing brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences. It is considered a brain disease because drugs change the brain—they change its structure and how it works. These brain changes can be long-lasting, and can lead to the harmful behaviors seen in people who abuse drugs.      Quitting smoking may not be a walk in the park but, it will bring you physical and emotional benefits that are astounding.  It is not impossible.  You will live through any discomfort.    We all quit and we may think of ourselves as Super men and women but, we are just like you. Nicotine addicts.       I encourage you to put this dangerous and deadly addiction to rest and start enjoying your freedom, your newfound confidence, your beautiful life.      love,   S
I often wonder why I chose January 29th 2017 to quit smoking. The answer is, I have no idea. What I do know is that was the right time for me! Why was the time right? I have no clue about that either. My point is that on Jan, 29th 2017 ..... MY time was right! For whatever reason I was able to cement my quit and have so far extended it to this point.        What is the right time for YOU to quit? I have no idea and you may not either but that shouldn't ever stop you from trying. This could very well be the right time for your life long quit. Don't miss that opportunity. Many remain here in this community because it gave so much to us as we crafted our quits and we want nothing more than to do the same for all of you. Whether it be your first attempt or your 4th or 5th attempt, we are here to do whatever we can to support you so gather your resolve and jump in! Nothing to lose and everything to gain
    Never give up...trying to give up.. What have you got to lose ....nothing ....but everything to gain... This is a killer addiction....  Smoking has killed more people ...than all the wars have....    These are  good folks ..loved ones ..taken far to early...  Don't just become a number ...  A little discomfort... For a while ...is better than a smoking related illness ..or worse...     
Great thread jo, I agree with all the above and also want to welcome back all you quitters. I truly believe that being a member of a forum and having the support of fellow quitters all over the world is the reason for my success. The daily NOPES, the investing in others quits and having others invested in mine helped hold me accountable. I highly recommend joining a support forum if for nothing more than to NOPE each day. And you never know, you just may end up with some lasting friendships, a couple of laughs and a lifelong quit Edited July 13, 2018 by jillar

    I love this thread.     Never stop trying!! 
    Think this needs a bump.... also... this time of year is hard in the early days of a quit, there are functions and parties all the time for the festive season... often someone who has quit will slip up during this time while out celebrating with friends and have a smoke and throw away their quit.... Its right to feel bad about it, all that hard work lost, all that effort up in smoke... it is right to be disappointing in yourself BUT don't beat yourself up too much... it is a very rare bread of smoker who is able to quit successfully on their very first go.... most of us have failed quits under our belts, some only a few hours old, some days, weeks, months or even years... but you know what you do... you get back on the quit train as soon as you.... you learn from your failed quit... what triggered you to smoke, how or what you could have done to avoid it and you don't make that mistake again... doesn't mean you wont make more mistakes, just learn from the ones you do... take those lessons, remember how wonderful your success felt and remember how low failing felt... pick yourself up, dust yourself off and get back on the Quit Train.... we have a seat here with your name on it.... we want you to come back... we want you to try again... so please do, please come back... take if from someone who wait well more than a decade to quit again after throwing away a really long quit.... the sooner you quit again the easier and better for you.     NEVER GIVE UP GIVING UP!

Made it 12 hours.   7:30 am, smoked a cigarette. I want to sort out what's the trigger, nicotine withdrawal, or the psychological habit. Put on a nicotine patch.   7:45 am, car needed gas. As I walked toward the mini mart to prepay for gasoline, I tossed the remaining cigarettes I had into the trash receptacle that was just outside the entry door.   1:00 pm, lunch time. Fought the urge to go and buy cigarettes. That's habit speaking, I reminded myself, not nicotine withdrawal, because I wasn't in withdrawal.   5::30 pm. Off work. Normally would have headed to my car, lighting up on the way. Urge to light up; thought about stopping and getting cigarettes. Identified it as habit, not withdrawal.  6:00 pm. Passed the drug store I used to buy cigarettes at. Debated at the left turn lane red light: do I stop and buy cigarettes, or keep going? It was habit grating on my nerves, not withdrawal.    6:10 pm. Safely at home. Walked the dog, then fed her. Feeling at loose ends. While she eats her dinner, I used to go out on the patio and smoke a cigarette. Instead, I sat at my computer desk, doing nothing, missing smoking.   6:30 pm. Made a humongous salad. Filling, but not satisfying. Made pancakes. Craving something sweet. Poured maple syrup on them.   6:55 pm. Wanted the smoke I used to have after dinner.  7:00 pm. Watched three episodes of Criminal Minds, cravings creeping into my mind about every 30 minutes. Told myself that this is habit, the mind creating tension because of the change.  9:57 pm. I made it through 12 hours. Actually 14 1/2 hours. Tomorrow is another day. I'm taking this a few hours at a time. When I have the psychological urge to smoke replaced with stronger thoughts and healthier habits, then I'll address the nicotine  addiction.    I actually think that the psychological habit/urge may be more of a problem than the nicotine desire for me.  Not sure, yet.    Got up the courage to put up a ticker. And may I never have to replace it with a differently dated one. But trusting myself to keep the commitment....not 100%. I've been here too many times before. I'm better armed with everyone's advice, participation in a preparation to quit program with my health insurance company, and this forum. Thanks to everyone who posted the thread where I reported my father's death. I really appreciate your advice and thoughts for strength. One hour at a time. The next eight won't be difficult. I'll be asleep. Only time I don't have to talk myself out of acting on a craving.
    Congratulations!  Looks like we have the same quit date.
Congratulations! You have made the best decision ever.   I'll share a few things I learned during my quit as I also used the patch. That was 11 years ago. I'm not sure if this is your first quit but it doesn't really matter. What matters is where you are now. You understand that you are going through a behavior change as well as a physiological change in your body. You will need something to help you with the "oral" fix. There are many good suggestions. One that seems very successful if cutting up straws to the same size as cigarettes and putting one in your mouth. You can go through the whole reach for the smokes, put it in your mouth and suck routine that you are used to .     Some quick tips-     That drug store that you used to buy your smokes at. Don't avoid it, confront it. I used to go to Walmart once a week and look the large wall of cigarette cartons. I'd stare them right down and say aloud "You CAN'T have me! I win, you lose!". It worked.   The patch- you will come to a point where you need to get rid of the patch or you will just be getting the nicotine from there. When that time comes buy some small square band aids. I used to put the band aid on the same part of my body where the patch had been. I basically "fooled" myself into thinking I was still getting nicotine. This worked amazingly well and the final withdrawal was almost painless.    Just remember- Smoking is not the answer, it never was.  Once you quit smoking, you need to deal with whatever it was that was really bothering you. You must develop different copying mechanisms but you will and you will succeed.  Just tell your self that you have no choice. I wish you the best!
You have got some great help tip from Andi above. There really are two parts to the quitting thing, at least in my mind. The physical addiction to Nicotine and the psychological part of smoking (that's the habit part you refer to Kate). If you are using NRT products then you are cutting down o the nicotine intake gradually, which is of benefit to many quitters but, you still have to deal with the psychological part which to me was the most difficult and longest adjustment but .... it's very doable if you put some thought into distracting yourself in order to use up all the spare time you will suddenly have. In the early days, do anything to use that time up. Change up your daily routine in small ways just so you have a NEW routine.Replace morning coffee with juice. Have a morning shower or if you did that before, take it at a slightly different time. Just small changes will help. If you went out for a smoke at a certain time, go for a short walk now even if it;s just around the house once or twice - be creative.     Just always remember; quitting smoking won't harm you in any way. Sure, it can be challenging and uncomfortable for a bit but that is just temporary. It does get better for everyone who continues to say NOPE each day! Every person here who has been quit for awhile will tell you the same thing. They just love the new lifestyle they have now as a non-smoker. No longer the slave to their nicotine addiction. Having to service it whenever it demands. And that doesn't mean just smoking but all the preparation work. Making sure you have smokes and lighters and somewhere to go to smoke and on,. and, on and on it goes. Embrace your new freedom! It may such right now but it won;t for long      By the way, congrats to both of you new quitters for getting through the early hours of your quits! Not easy in those early days but so worthwhile in the long run!Edited December 13, 2018 by reciprocity
    Hi Kate, congrats on a day quit already, that's great  Love the clues @Andi has given. I'm a huge supporter of the air cigarette as it helped me immensely my first few months quit. The bandaid trick is a great idea too and one I hadn't heard before but if it works as good as the air cig does I will definitely be passing that clue along to others      
    Kate,   Please commit to yourself and your quit.    It is the only way.  Fake it until you make it, kiddo.   
    G’day   you really are proforming a death defying feat......    C 
    Kate, you can do this.  Don't over think it. Everyday you go without a cigarette,  you will begin to feel so much better about yourself.  Hang tough and stay close. 
    Well done Kate ...freeing yourself from this killer addiction is the. Most rewarding thiing you can ever do.....    The rewards are endless...  One day at a a time ......  You can do it ...you just need to believe in yourself ...
    Great stuff, Kate.  Just take it one moment at a time and you will get there.  Focus on the positives to quitting - the perceived negatives are only temporary and go away with time.

Turn out lights, check oven/stove, windows locked, water for dog, cell phone in purse, etc, about 14 items.   Have to revise my list. No longer need to put lighter and cigarettes in my purse, and be sure I have an orange in my lunch. The orange was for the peel. After I smoked a cigarette on my lunch break, I broke up pieces of orange peel, crushed them in my palms to release the scented oils, and lightly smoothed that over my face, hands, and hair. After that, I chewed on another piece so that my breath would be citrus-y, not blech.

I basically "fooled" myself into thinking I was still getting nicotine. This worked amazingly well and the final withdrawal was almost painless.         Funny you mention this now, Andi, because I just heard something about medical researchers doing more research into the placebo effect and how it can be ethically used with patients.  I seem to recall that the effect occured even when the patient was told that the pill s/he was taking was just a sugar pill.    I like the band aid idea. The body would be conditioned to experiencing the relief of nicotine when a patch was in place. Instead of doing a step down--i.e., from 21 mg to a 14 mg patch--I may go directly to band aid patches. I'll have a talk with myself first to discuss how it could work and I'll be so happy.
Yesterday at 4:20 pm my father died of smoking-related emphysema. He had smoked for more than 50 years. How many years more would he have had with a wife and family he loved?  I have not given up on myself. I have a new job as of several months ago, and it comes with excellent health insurance. I have joined the medical insurance company's preparation for smoking cessation coaching program to help with better plans for quitting and making it stick. The first session was an eye opener. I though I knew all of the strategies for quitting, but I was wrong. It's a Web-based conference call, supposed to be a small group of four of us, but the other three didn't show up. It was nice to have one-on-one conversation about my past efforts and how I can make this time the last time. Three more sessions to go. After that, they offer a staying-quit coaching group, which I also will join.     When I am truly quit and have a month or two successfully lived as a nonsmoker, I'll be back to make daily pledges.  Until then,  may you all be happily living free of addiction and breathing only clean air.
    I'm really sorry about your dad's passing away yesterday Kate  Glad you're working on quitting again.....
    Im sorry Kate, Stay strong! A kiss and hug your way.
    Condolences on the passing of your beloved father Kate! I'm glad to hear you are pursuing every method of creating a successful quit for yourself that you can. This smoking addiction is nasty and I just hate it! It only takes and gives us nothing good in return.      Hope to see you when ever you feel you'd like some support from us here on the Train.
    So sorry to hear Kate. I lost my dad to virtually the same thing almost three years ago and have wanted to quit every since.  I do not want to only be able to live by the length of a hose. What misery that has to be and could it have been prevented? Probably . I also saw what throat cancer did and hope I have the strength to stay strong enough to beat these demons. I have come to want this more than anything and wish for you the same thing! Prayers to you and your family.
    Welcome back to the forum and sorry to hear about your dad 
    I'm sorry to hear about your dad, Kate.     Smoking truly is horrible.  Feel free to reach out to us as you embark on your quit journey. 
    Sorry about your dad.  Condolences.     As you continue with the process of quitting, feel free to take a seat on the Train anytime you like.       Best wishes to you and your family.
    I am so sorry to hear about your father's death.     
    Prayers for strength and peace.
    Kate,   So terribly sorry about the loss of you dad.  I bet this is especially tough during the holidays.       I am glad you have come to realize the health costs of smoking.  You do not have to wait to become a part of the forum.  We would love to follow you on your journey of ridding yourself of this addiction.  There is so much information here and lots of friendship.  We are a great support system.  We have all been through the withdrawal and come out on the other side. Linda

    Kate, I am so very, very sorry for your loss. 
    Sorry to hear about your father.         
    I am really sorry, Kate.

Sending heartfelt condolences to you and your family Kate.      Please quit ASAP.       Each year, over 6 million* other people are experiencing this grief as a result of death from direct tobacco use.       * World Health Organization
My condolences on the passing of your father.       Please do not confuse thinking of and planning for quitting for actually quitting and trying to save your life.  I have seen hundreds (thousands?) of people over the years use lengthy preparation as an unconscious method of avoiding the actual quit.  The time to quit is now, and every cigarette is damaging and potentially killing you.  You have everything you need to be successful right now.          Christian99 Nearing 17 Years Quit

    It is always tough to lose a loved one.  Now it's your turn to prevent that for yourself.  Just quit.  Stop it.  Now.  Making plans to quit means you are not serious about it.  It's like talking about taking a trip or going on a cruise.  It's just talk.  You are not going on the trip or taking a cruise until you go.  Cutting down, using alternative methods or fooling yourself is not quitting.  Like jumping into a cold swimming pool, no matter how long you wait, the water is still cold.   YOu have to confront the demon called nicotine and go to war against him, vowing never to bow to his influences ever again.  We're here to help.  Put them down today and never buy another pack, never borrow another butt.  It's tough for a week, then it gets better.

Be sure and make your NOPE pledge everyday.  It may seem silly but it works.    Sweetie, you can do this!

I have watched most of Joel's videos and Allen Carr's, watched videos about diseases, documentaries about people dying from smoking, have poured through websites and read about harm smoking causes, and engaged socially at the quit smoking forum that dissolved.  I've clocked hundreds of hours trying to force myself to desire to quit.     There is a region of the brain that is supposed to be developed in humans by the time we're in our early twenties.  I'm sure we've all heard about the prefrontal cortex.  I've had problems with other impulses (maybe partly a problem of being bipolar) throughout my life. By working on the skill of impulse control in general, I am hopeful that I can quit smoking.     I don't know what else to do.

When I feel more confident I'll put it back.
@Kate18, you can quit even if you still desire to smoke. I did. I had to! I equated it to the desires I've had throughout my life, like I still want to ride dirt bikes, but know I can't anymore. I still want to jump over people on a pogo stick but know I can't anymore. I looked at it like things that I outgrew and smoking was one of them. I still have days i would like to smoke but know I can't anymore.....  As long as you're ready to quit, you can quit.... I did      Edited December 9, 2018 by jillar
    Hi Kate and welcome to your forever quit!       I hope you can put some of the things you have learned from looking into the impulse control issue to use with this quit. You will have a lot of people here to support you as you move forward so please use this forum as much as you need to. Of course we also have an SOS page that has been very effective for many should you ever need it. There is even a thread on that page called Pre-respond To Your Own SOS. There you can write a meaningful message to yourself about why you should never give in again and you can always go there in an instant to read it should you be having a weak moment. It's a great resource.        It sounds like you really want this quit and you are prepared for it as much as any of us can be so jump right in, pledge NOPE every day and lean on us here for support because that's what we are here for     
    Congratulations on quitting smoking Kate.   The voice of the addict is a complete LIE.  There is NOTHING, physiological or psychological, that forces us to continue an addiction.  There is NOTHING preventing an addict from cleaning up. You always have choice.  Always.    Please choose LIFE. Commit to yourself, your quit and NOPE. That is IT. NOPE-ly yours,  S       You might have some things to add on this threadRed Flags

Think how smoking really does nothing for you.    You can do this!
    Great to see you have quit Kate ....    You can do it ....one day at a time ...take time to read all you can ,and watch the video,s.....    Don't forget our NOPE thread...it's a powerful tool...and will set you up and running every day....
Today was a day off from working, so I have been reading the book by Baumeister and Tierney, "Willpower." They report the many studies of the effects of blood glucose on decision-making ability. I am about 95 % through transitioning to a plant-based diet, influenced by a book entitled "The Engine 2 Diet." My blood labs and blood pressure have me in early heart attack and stroke territory, so I'm make what seems to be the best change in diet.       When I was hungry, I reached for a cigarette. From now on, when I'm wanting to smoke, I'll ask myself if I am just hungry. If I have a piece of fruit for quick glucose, followed by beans and rice or soup pre-made.  If these guys are right, then my ability to resist a craving will be stronger.       I've been afraid of weight gain and used smoking to curb my appetite. I just went on Amazon and ordered three size 12 jeans (I'm usually a 10). I'm preparing for the likely weight gain that can result with quitting smoking when food becomes a substitution.  I hate doing this. I worked so hard to get from 220 down to 145. I've stayed in a normal weight range for 10 years. Quitting smoking is more important, and if it means temporary weight gain, then I'll accept that.         According to this book, keeping a steady blood glucose level greatly enhances decision-making ability and makes a person more successful at beating addiction. Since all the gross pictures, sad stories, daily pledges to stay quit, and info on Joel's site (and other sites) didn't cause a strong enough desire to stay quit, then I'll try something else. I'll approach addiction from a biological/neurological standpoint. I don't feel like such a loser when I read the studies of what the authors call willpower depletion in their subjects.

    Quitting smoking is a journey .....some gain weight some don't .....    Once you have a good solid quit going ...you will find its then you worry about the few pounds you have gained ,and then start to watch your diet....   Its hard to do the two together....quitting the cancer sticks is your first priority.... They are killing you ...a few extra pounds are not the killer....  Be kind to yourself......don't over think...         
    How are you today ? Remember    HALT    check this thread outRiffing On H.A.L.T.         
@Kate18 so sorry for your loss. my dad also had emphysema. you can do this, and this is a great support system. hugs!
After many failed attempts, I quit successfully over 3 years ago by pledging NOPE (just for today) every day until I could just say "not one puff ever". The difference was being educated about all the lies of addiction that could possibly draw me back into smoking and having a response to each one, understanding that my mind was being hijacked by some kind of drug lords. I personally think will power is over rated. For me, it was about education and taking it one day at a time, one hour at a time, sometimes one minute at a time. Do anything except smoke.
    Will power or determination IS required but I agree that education about the addiction is probably the most important thing in terms of not only quitting but also protecting your quit because until you truly believe that smoking offers you nothing positive, you are at risk so .... educate yourselves on this addiction. It really matters!
    So sorry for your loss, Kate.   Something i read or heard somewhere that i found reassuring at the start of my quit was "nothing bad will happen if you don't smoke",  i suppose it's linked to the anxiety of stopping smoking, similar to what you said about your ticker making you panicky. And i think it's true that smoking causes anxiety too.  I really hope you stick with your quit and stay here for support as it is a great place
    Sorry to hear about your father, Kate.  I know what it’s like to lose a parent to smoking related diseases. I lost my mom a couple of years ago. She smoked most of her life.       Others are right. The time is now. Just do it and move on with your life.It’s not that difficult once you get past the first week or so. Then it’s all in your mind. You do indeed have control of your thoughts.       Cigarettes do nothing for you. They take away your time, your money and your health.
Hello - I read through some of the posts about relapsing, but figured to post a new message.        In October, I relapsed with cigarettes. I quit cigarettes in March 2015 after smoking regularly (1 1/2 packs a day) for 19 years. During a very stressful week then (including the synagogue shooting massacre here in Pittsburgh), I bought a pack, and have been smoking since.       It's weird. And idiotic. I can't figure out the triggers. I smoke only at home. I don't think about smoking during work, in the car, working out, socializing. Just at home. And I'm back to the same terrible habit of sneaking outside for a smoke (a few a day), including the wake-up cig, post-work cig, etc.      I'm furious with myself. I worked so hard to get nicotine-free, and find myself smoking really for no reason. I' need help to stop it.      If anyone has any advice or experienced something similar, let me know. (When I prepped for my qui in 2015, I was on quitsmokingmessageboard.com, and found invaluable support there. That website seems to be gone now.)        Edited December 3, 2018 by Sparky
    Hi Sparky - yes, QSMB is gone! I was a member there and managed to educate myself about my addiction and keep my quit solid while there....once that site was no more, I came here along with several others and it is has been so helpful in maintaining my quit (also a lot of laughs along the way!).        There are always going to be life events that are stressful, depressing, etc. but why feel you have to go back to smoking to get past them? I am sure that first cigarette you smoked after a couple of years smoke free was awful, wasn't it? What did it do for you? Watch some of Joel's videos, read through members blogs and posts and start NOPING every day! You have done it before, you can do it again!       
    Sparky, welcome aboard for this journey.  Others will come by soon that will have good advice on relapsing.  I would suggest that you look thru all the educational material here on the sight and I am sure there is a video on this in the video library.  Education is all powerful.  You must understand that smoking does not solve anything and can only make things work.  Please go through all this is on this site.  We will be here to support you and hopefully answer questions you might have.  Also QSMB is no longer any several of the members of that site are now here on this site -- you may recognize the names as they come up.  Anyway when you are ready to quit again we are here to support!!!
    Hi sparky, welcome to quittrain. You will find the same support here as you did at qsmb. Stay glued here as much as possible for that first year or longer and read anything and everything as it pertains to your quit. Let's get this done  
    Welcome to the board, Sparky.  I'm really sorry to hear about your relapse.  I hope you see that life is better without cigarettes and that you are going to quit again.  It is true what is said here (and at QSMB), take NOPE seriously.  You can never take another puff.  It will awaken the addiction again and you never want to do that.     Stick around here.  Read and participate often.  It can help you stay quit for good.  I came from QSMB too and I can tell you that there are a lot of good folks here who want to see you succeed at quitting as well.
The reason that you are smoking is that you are addicted. All of my failed quit attempts were ultimately down to a lack of education about what it means to be addicted, all the lies that the nicotine addiction feeds you and strategies for getting through the first year. After that it is just a matter on doing the same thing over and over again. I am back posting after more than 3 years because I am having these weird occasional thoughts of 'having just one'... This is the biggest lie of nicotine addiction. But I am sure it will pass, it always does. These urges to smoke always go away and can remain thankfully dormant for a long long time but one has always to be prepared for them to rise again.
Thanks everyone (and I do recognize some of you from QSMB, like johnny5 - at least your pic!). I'll be on here, and I'm so, so glad I found this forum.         I'm going to plan on a new quit day. I need to re-educate myself on the dormancy of addiction. I know the couple of times since summer when I had that "one" after 3 1/2 years, thinking it's just the "one." And I tricked myself into thinking that it wouldn't do anything in the near future.       I think of all the great things I accomplished post-quitting (bought my first house, found and started a great new job), and how do I get back to that power without cigarettes?
    Smoking gives you nothing Sparky - only takes away from the best things in your life including life itself in the end.  Jump on the train and ride your way to freedom again! We will be here for support but it's up to you ultimately to make it happen.  You can do this!
    You did it before and you can do it again Sparky. You have not failed as long as you keep honestly trying in your heart. Pick a date and get back here. Good people and lots of support. Best wishes.
After about 20 failed attempts to quit smoking I finally succeeded on the qsmb in 2015 by educating myself about all the lies that i believed about nicotine and my smoking. It worked and i am not a smoker to this day.       Unfortunately a few months after I quit I was diagnosed with lung cancer. I am still here though but would have been glad to have missed that experience in my early 50s after 35 years of smoking.     There are also lots of people on this forum who are suffering from smoking related diseases. I quit too late to avoid one of the worst. Be someone who quits early enough to miss the bad outcomes.
    Sparky,     As you can see I am very early into my quit, a month and a day. All I can say is that the people on this site care. I had quit once before but this time is totally different. I want it...like I have never wanted anything. I realize I could fail but I'm not worried about it right now. Is it easy nope but it is easier. I hate cigarettes...the smell , the stigma everything about them. My wife still smokes, and that is something that weighs heavy on my mind. Most people asks if that makes it harder. I can honestly say no now.         I'm not the one that smells like smoke and trying to find a warm place to blow one when we go somewhere. There is no smoking when we are traveling unless we stop and she can get out of the truck. I am not one of those holy rollers...yet... but cannot ...do not... want to be around it. I wish she would at least try again , but she must not be ready. But that aside , listen to these folks because they are the best, and genuinely care. I will stay quit, I feel it this time and hope that you get that same feeling back.        Good luck and like they say..NOPE!
    Welcome aboard Sparky.  I don't have much to add as you have already received great advice in this thread.      However, I will say just a couple of quick things.  Smokers relapse because we are addicts who conditioned ourselves with cigarettes for years.  Any other "reason" to smoke is merely an excuse.  As has already been mentioned, education is vital to building a solid quit.  Understand your addiction and shed light on the lies we all told ourselves as smokers.      A relapse is not something that just happens.  It is a choice.  There is only one choice to make in building a quit: do I smoke or not?  Choose wisely and you will be free from cigarettes for good.       Buckle up, knuckle down, and drive on.

    Welcome aboard Sparky...    Sorry to hear you you smoked ....once a addict always a addict...   There is alot of information here to help you quit again.....Watch all joels Video,s....    Smoking doesn't change ,solve,fix ,anything ....    Take smoking Off the Table ...you can do it ....you Will receive all the support you need here....  Looking forward to getting to know you better ...
    Right... first, don't be an idiot like me and wait well over a decade to quit again. Strike now... because the longer you leave it the harder it is.        One day at time. You only have to quit for a day. That's not too hard, just one day.         
    Hi Sparky.  Welcome aboard again.  I am in the early stages of quitting but find it helps when I can help and encourage others.  That was a terrible incident in Pittsburgh that took lives.  Why let that sick person take any more lives, including yours.  You did this before and can do it again.      Get your new quit going and we will be right there with you.  
    Hello Sparky,   You will have a successful quit when you understand your nicotine addiction and commit to Not One Puff EVER.    Relapse is a choice, a dangerous and regrettable choice.    Better to choose Life and Freedom.  I am glad you are here. S    
    Quit now!  Jump!  
OK... so I remembered what I wanted to say... so that 3 1/2 year quit you had... that's gone now... don't dwell on it... you need to move forward... this is your new quit... its a new day, a new beginning, you move forward always, don't even bother looking back on what you had... remember the lessons you learnt but don't dwell in the past...
G’day Sparkey   I have a 3 year quit. I front up every morning and make that simple acknowledgement. Not One Puff Ever. NOPE.   I started on the QSMB just before going to wedding and worrying about relasping with old friends and all. That was feb 2016, missed an occasional day since then.   Well every days diferent. Births and weddings, deaths, parties, Xmas, cancer, birthdays, which job will I take? New truck, and they are just some of the more exciting.     I personally like the normal ones, fully of perfectly uneventful stuff.... still    they start with a NOPE. I invite you to start fronting up and taking the NOPE pledge. It’s corny it’s public.   Confessing to being an Addict that will never be able to take another puff, might be daughting. But it’s truely painless and quick and you get to spend the rest of your day enjoying heaps of other shit that doesnt involve smoking!  Chris
    Thanks everyone for the support and for sharing your experiences!       The last time I bought a pack, the other day, another customer in line at the convenience store looked me up and down when I ordered a pack and asked me "Why are YOU a smoker??" A complete stranger. I told him, "Because I'm an idiot." I do believe it's one of many, many signs recently that I need to regain control, make a choice, and stop.       This is ending.

    Looking forward to seeing your new quit date. May I suggest getting yourself a ticker for your signature so you can watch all the time, money and cigarettes not smoked add up? I loved watching mine

    G’day Sparky    Good! ..... catch you tomorrow  C
    Nobody can help you but you.    When you want to quit, you will quit.   When you don't want to quit, you will continue to fart around.  Only you can choose one way or the other.   Don't look to us.   We can't do it for you.     ezpz

(I know some disagree with picking a specific date/time)              You're doing this the right way; picking a date the following day.  Some pick a date after the holidays, after this or that and it's just not necessary.  It's like telling a {pick your drug} addict to keep on using until they're more comfortable to stop using.  Either way, today is the day.  BTW, I had my last cigarette at 7pm the day I quit.     You should start a blog today to chronicle your quit.  Use it as a journal of sorts because it's another way of keeping yourself accountable to stay nicotine free.  The other way of course is one that you've already done; telling the world that you're quitting this evening at 8pm.  Trust me, we'll be watching.
    You can do it !!!!  Once you have made the decision never to ..Never put any thing in your mouth and set fire to it ....youv,e quit.......

    I'm done. Lighter drowned, butts outside in the trash on the curb.   
    Well done Sparky.  You should go to the Daily NOPE section and vow not to smoke today with the simple word "NOPE".

    That's great news, Sparky.  This is your first step to a much better life.      Try to focus on the positive.  You are doing a great thing.
    You got this sparky!

    Great News, Sparky! We are here for you. I am terribly sorry for the stress you endured, please remember, you are not alone.

Still do a bit. This feeling that I'm denying myself some sense of pleasure.
    That feeling is pretty standard Sparky yet I know it's hard to shake. Try to focus on the big picture though .... improved health - improved wealth and freedom from enslavement to nicotine addiction! Those are all huge benefits. It's even harder during the holiday season because we all want to "feel good" and smoking was part of our feel good process when we smoked. Truth is, not smoking can make us feel a lot better about things. No more running outside for a smoke in the cold and missing time with family & friends or worrying about if we have enough smokes to tide us over while the stores are closed at Christmas           Giving the finger to smoking during the holidays can feel REAL GOOD!
    Sparky, great that you stopped smoking.  You mentioned you felt like you were denying yourself some sense of pleasure -- look at that thought as rubbish.  You are giving yourself more pleasure as the benefits of not smoking will begin to add up -- you are giving yourself a new sense of freedom, enjoy it!!!!
    Hello. Just an update. I am doing really well enjoying the approaching holidays as a non-smoker there are so many benefits that I lose count of all the good things about not smoking. I come here every day and read sometimes a little sometimes a lot. And there are so many that I say that's me! Or sometimes I say hey that used to be me!    Like everyone else I have good days and bad days but I continually have more better days than bad days. Sometimes I forget to reward myself and when I do it feels really great! I wish I was better at commenting, because the comments of so many of you have gotten me through some tough spots. I know sometimes people disappear and we wonder what happened to them and you all have been so good to me I just wanted to stop in and let you know I'm doing well actually I'm doing great! Thank you for all you do
    I am so happy to hear from you, Parsley.    All your comments are very appreciated.     It is great that you are having more better days than rugged ones.  The good days will get longer and better.   To be honest, the first year can be full of surprise triggers.  Some are seasonal, some are just the remnants of your brain receptors that didn't get the memo yet, YOU QUIT SMOKING !      Please continue building your beautiful quit and do reward yourself.    Thanks for checking in, we do worry and wonder. Hope you have wonderful holidays, Parsley.  S
    Parsley, so glad you are doing so well.  We understand you are enjoying life as a non smoker!  Keep checking in and keeping us up on you journey.  It helps us to know that lives can be changed.   Linda
Thanks for sticking around Parsley and letting us know you're doing well. That IS important to us here because I think we tend to take on other people's quits like they are our own and you're right, it is a little concerning when people just disappear and we don't know if they are OK or not. I know most just move on with life but still, we wonder.       And please don't feel your comments are inadequate or not important for others to hear. I think we all feel that way and we don't realize that the simple words any of us may have to offer on any given day might just register with someone we don't even know who is thinking about quitting or trying to quit. Every single contribution here could be a live-savor to someone  Edited December 7, 2018 by reciprocity
    Thanks so much for your words Parsley.  Your quit seems to going good now.  Never be afraid to add your comments.  Your simple but effective way of documenting your quit can and will help so many people, they will see that though there are difficult times you can quit this habit and reap many rewards !!!!
    Great to hear from you Parsley....and great to hear you are doing well with your fabulous quit ...x
    Great to see your traveling so well. Never think sharing your story or offering your opinion is not important because often it is the simple little things you say that are the spark that lights someone else's fire to quit... or it is the comment that changes someones life...
    Thanks for the update parsley, glad you're doing so well 
When I tried quitting before, I was always just abstaining, trying to find something to make me not want to smoke. that's what I was trying to buy each time, something to change my mind for me and squash my desire. but nothing did, because we all know, nothing does, that comes from within yourself. anyway, I digress, in my failed quits, I was always bargaining with myself, for example, I'll quit, but allow myself one or two cigarettes a day as a reward, I calculated that I was only then smoking between 2.5 and 5% of my pre quit amount, and therefore I was very good, and should not feel bad, but feel triumphant instead. another deal, was the I'll smoke other peoples cigarettes, therefore I was no longer wasting money. I switched to roll your own cigarettes, therefore my habit was costing less, again, no guilt, but pride at how clever and economic I was. then I started putting filter tips in the roll your own cigarettes, so that they were healthier, again wasn't I good! I was always making stupid deals with myself about my smoking to try to justify my continued useage. This mindset often creeps into the freshly quit newbie.  and it can be devastating and undermining to your best laid plans. try to recognise this bargaining, and address it, either personally, or by discussing it.  but do it before the chatter becomes overwhelming.
I wish, like you, I had of understood this last year. When I tried to quit in July and then October, every time ending up with a different smoking criteria. The pats on the back for going a day, or having 10 a day, or  whatever were crazy - I was smoking! I shake my head now, if I just had of held on and trusted that the world would not have this many reformed smokers if this were impossible.  Great message Jonny, thanks and re-inforces my thought process which is handy as that's where I am in this quit now.

Great post Jonny, you actually had me laughing at my own actions as a smoker!  I used to feel that I was being so much healthier and saving money by rolling my own and using a filter!  It's just insane! I remember when they started including another chemical in cigarettes to help with the fire hazard when dropped etc...and how outraged I was at the idea that they were doing that!  It's like they didn't care about my health at all.  :wacko2: that additional chemical was a  game changer for sure!
Oh the bargaining.....I think smokers make great lawyers. Haha.  I remember,  whatever the bargain was....the cigarette was always my reward.  Crazy
Oh I remember searching the garage floor for dockers....well it wasn't a real full cig was it?, didn't count....oh the things I would do and tell myself ;)

Oh I remember searching the garage floor for dockers....well it wasn't a real full cig was it?, didn't count....oh the things I would do and tell myself ;) It's funny looking back, as a teen, I would look for cigarette butts, and roll out the remaining tobacco into a little tin to make "butt rollies" as we would call them.  it's pretty disgusting really lol, and nothing like the James Dean persona that my midseye was creating for me!!  how I couldn't see that I was a hopeless nicotine junkie... I was going to say I don't know!... but I do, we all do. I'm so glad to have moved on from that episode of my life.
I carried on with the bargains....when facing a big trigger I used to promise my junky that we could smoke AFTER the event. Of course, by then I didn't want to...but the deal helped me through a few craves!

Exactly that. I'm not the sharpest tool, but my junkie is always so desperate for a deal, that he falls for the same trick every time.... You sell yourself short my friend. each of us has a different smoking conundrum to solve, it's all pretty much the same physiologically, and the recovery clock ticks the same etc, but it's the crazy justifications that we created that we have to unravel for ourselves.  sometimes I find that examples, and analogies can flick a switch for someone, but the personal riddle is yours to solve alone.... and you have found your riddle key :-) you are playing your junkie at his own game :-) very sharp if you ask me :-)
    bump        and here is a list of Red Flags,    more voices of our addict.  Stay vigilant, y'all.
    Hey all     Just wanted to get thoughts and opinions on why we relapse after years sometimes. 
It's an addiction Kdad, plain & simple and we are all nicotine addicts.     Weak moment years down the road - too much to drink at a social gathering & someone offers a smoke and you momentarily think; "I beat this smoking thing for years. I can have one .... it won't hurt". You have one or even a few drags and it awakens your junkie brain. A day or two later you buy a pack thinking you can just have another one. Surely you could smoke just one a day and not 20 or 30 like you used to. Within a week you're back up to a pack a day and the regret over what you did is crushing.        It's really easy to maintain your quit once you have a full year or more under your belt but you must always guard against doing something foolish on a whim. People don't smoke years after they quit because they have some overwhelming urge to smoke again. It's always something that starts out very innocently but ends up badly. The circumstances vary but the story is always the same ..... I thought I could have just one!
    Good question, and not really someone qualified to answer, still way too young in my quit.      However I think (and this is based on a recent super intense crave episode) the starting point of the relapse is what is crucial to identify. We long for familiarity in unfamiliar or stressful situations, and in such cases, whether months or years after your quit, the brain automatically rewinds to the "familiar" which was lighting up. Regardless of whether that helped or not, it was just the next "natural" thing to do. So maybe that pattern is sometimes hidden for years and suddenly comes to the fore. It's like the brain trying to comfort itself by saying, the last time you did this action, and were able to get through, so let's rinse and repeat, in a manner of speaking.        The fact is the last time and each time, the only way out is through, so one has to deal with situations. Having a cigarette in my hand won't change the dynamics of the problem, but yes that's the fight we gotta win each time.
    I have never had a long quit...this is the longest.... I only did odd days,odd week here and there...   As its been said ..It's a Addiction...and we must always be on our guard...not to let junkie thinking in ....   We get complacent.... We think one wont hurt.....we think it's only one,I won't get hooked...   It only takes that one ..to wake the monster....
Its a great question... especially for newbies if they see people further along quit. So I threw away a long quit, I didn't loose it, I chose to toss it away but having a smoke, buying a pack and being a junky. I can tell you this quit, the one I have now, will be the last quit I have... and it feels completely different to the first one. This quit is basically a done deal now, I know I can never have another puff because I know 1 puff and I'm a pack a day within a week. But this time I don't even want one.        So the first time I quit was for over 6 years. That said I felt the same at 6 years as I did at 3 weeks... I never got beyond that... I only kept the quit as long as I did because I couldn't find a "good enough" (in my twisted brain) reason (excuse) to justify to myself and others why I smoked.... eventually I found one.... it was pathetic but it was the first 'decent' thing I found. You see I only quit because someone else said I couldn't... I didn't want to quit, I just wanted to prove them wrong... the whole time I didn't smoke I romanced the cigarette... I sought out people who smoked and hung with them so I could second hand smoke.... every day I wanted one... I just had to find a reason where (in my mind) I wouldn't look too bad if I smoked. So I had one after a car accident... then bought a pack... then bought another pack... and continued to do that for more than a decade... and then I have this quit... I hardly ever think about smoking anymore and when I do I get a feeling of revulsion.... this is my sticky quit... completely different mind set.
    Being comfortable enough to believe that they can outsmart the Law of Addiction...you can't. One=all.       NOPE. 
    Prior to this quit, I only refrained from smoking when pregnant, fully intending to smoke again asap.       This quit feels rock solid but, I know that I can throw it away with one puff.  I think the realization that I am an addict and the education about nicotine addiction that is refreshed consistently   helps to solidify my quit.  Also, the horrifying thought of re-living another quit quells any junkie thought that might creep in.   I never ever want to go through that again.     Being an addict is a curious thing. It never goes away and is instantly awakened with ONE puff. This is why vigilance is fundamental.        
    G'day   And did you know that first cig tastes like crap. Doesn't give you that lift or anything that you remember. Still you go back to smoking though.    Well, I'm awake to that now. I'm not forgetting and get myself robbed again.    NOT ONE PUFF EVER   C
    We are all addicts.  The longer you go without smoking, the more dormant the addiction becomes.         I rarely think about smoking now but the occasional thought does still hit me.  It is weak but it is still there.       Recognizing that you will always be an addict and that you can never take another puff is the key.  You will get to the point where you rarely think about smoking anymore and aren't tempted by it.        Some people at this stage, I think, believe they have the addiction beat and think "just one won't hurt."  They let their guard down completely and decide to light up.  Horrible mistake.  That re-ignites the addiction.      The key is to stick to NOPE - not one puff ever.  That is the only way you beat the addiction.
    Don't include all of us in your "we". The Sarge will NEVER relapse.     Those who relapse, do so for one and only one reason : they smoked tobacco.         EZPZ
    We are all addicts and as such we are all one puff away from a pack a day.
    Once you internalize that smoking has no benefit - and learn that one puff will start the active addiction again - then you will have your stickey quit.        As human beings, we do not want to do things that will not have a benefit for us.       So once you internalize that smoking has no benefit, you simply will not want to do it.         It is exactly for these same reasons, that most people who have never smoked, never start.          Cristóbal            
    SMOKING IS A ADDICTION..... It's not a habit..!!!!!......once my brain totally understood this ....I settled down in this quit...   I thought I was a lady...yes some of you... Lady lol......who just had a ciggy habit ....no i was a junkie......    So ...like any other addiction...there is no such thing as ..Just One !!!!
those that relapse were still convinced somewhere in their brain that smoking actually did something for them.  Even if they stayed abstinent for 10 years.         those of us who KNOW it does absolutely nothing for us....we will never relapse.  Ever.
ahhh we think "oh one will not kill me" but yes as addicts, it is not going to be just one! And even that one makes you a smoker. Point blank.. We can do this when stressed, drunk haha, etc. When my stepson passed I lit up the same night. I said it will just be to make it through the next few days..yeah OK! I smoked almost another 3 years. Never again. NOPE!
    Great thoughts everyone! The habit vs addiction distinction has to be made to make a quit last. I think a part of the addiction is a need and satisfaction cycle.  It's a cycle independent of nicotine per say, which is why substituting hard candy for instance works. You want something - you satisfy that want. This dynamic is at the forefront and you could say that indeed smoking "does" provide something, the completion of the cycle of want. The trick seems to be A - finding other things to want or B - realizing that you don't need anything. Not at all saying I have this figured out, just some thoughts.        Ken

My dad smoked over 40 years. Had 5 by-pass surgery, half his voice box removed, COPD, and had quit for 26 years. We had just got done eating a great breakfast...pancakes , eggs, bacon , and a great cup of coffee. I watched him push himself away from the table and reach for his pocket. I couldn't believe it. I said really? He said you don't understand I could smoke one so easy right now it would make your head spin , but it  will pass very quick. That is how strong this is. He died because of smoking and I still crave it on a daily basis. I feel guilty for how I feel and think how can you quit and crave it after 26 years? I know it will take time but pray every day I can withstand the temptation. This sucks! How can something like this control your life? I have quit what I thought were a lot worse habits as a youngster and realize now just what kind of grip these nasty things have on me. I hate it!
@Wantsit, this addiction is a monster no doubt about it. The good thing about the craves farther down the road is that they are just brief thoughts that are easily dismissed. I still have them from time to time and figure I probably always will. But they are gone as quickly as they come.    You are doing great and I promise you these bad days will become fewer and farther apart the longer you are quit 
Thank you jillar. I hope so because up until now I've done really well. We buried a friend of mine today...62 years old because of lung cancer. Have to stay strong!
    I'm sorry about the loss of your friend @Wantsit, and yes stay strong because it will be so worth it. 
    Yes, sorry about your friend Wantsit. That and other horrible health issues is what smoking has in store for us almost surely if we continue to light up. Quitting is our best option! And Jillar is absolutely correct in what she said. Yes, there are still thoughts of smoking that come to us from time to time but they are no longer what I would call cravings. They are very easy to dismiss. The key is you have to truly believe that smoking did nothing positive for you; only harm. If that is your true mindset, dismissing these thoughts about smoking is very easy - virtually no effort. Not like the early days of your quit that's for sure.       Stay with it. You too will be fine  
    You guys are the bomb!! Thank you for all your positive thoughts!
I have been quit for 14'ish months. I smoked for 15 years. It is still several times a week I get a brief crave for a smoke.    For your own situation -  It looks like you are on your third week. Just use that as encouragement when needed and think, "I survived three weeks without a smoke, no need to ruin it now". You have made it through the wort days which is the first week. Battles will come and go but you already proved you can do it.      Some people here need this forum to maintain their quit in the beginning. Yeah there is a lot of fun stuff, joking around, whatever. The sad parts though is hearing about omeone's death from smoking. I doubt anyone picked up their first cigarette and thought, "This could eventually kill me, this will cost me, it will make me stink, make me a slave, etc".    Cigarettes are evil little bastards.        What made me finally want to quit more than i wanted to smoke - I finally realized what assholes cigarettes are. I came to hate them.   What helps me keep my quit NOW is this - I do not want to go back to the slavery of being a smoker. I prefer to live on MY terms. Even if parts of my lifestyle pisses off the Trump supporters. Wait, wrong forum...   But to be honest, yes there are times I really want one. Cannot do it though.       So then,  what is YOUR reason to never go back to smoking?

I hate it!               Hello Wansit,      Congratulations on completed Week # 3 !!!       Your Dad still wanted to smoke because even after 26 years of not smoking, he did not have enough education to eliminate the lies the addiction had created in his head, telling him there were benefits of smoking. As long as you believe there are benefits of smoking, you will not have a happy quit and you will feel like you are depriving yourself.        So how do you go from the Point A of being a smoker, to the Point B of being a happy non-smoker who has internalized that there are no benefits of smoking ???      It is done through education about nicotine addiction, and how it affected you physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.          Quitting smoking involves stopping smoking, but that is not all of it if you want to have a stable and happy quit.      Invest time in yourself and your quit, and educate yourself as much as you can:     Check out  http://www.whyquit.com       Watch Joel Spitzer´s videos here on QuitTrain https://www.quittrain.com/forum/15-joel-spitzers-quit-smoking-video-library/      And spend some time every day on this forum, asking questions as you did right now.     All of this will help you put your mind and body where it needs to be - with a strong educated quit, ready to live life again as it should be lived: in complete freedom of all that you are as a human being, from addiction.          CristóbalEdited November 24, 2018 by Cristóbal

And it is different in many ways from my first quit, I agree. I need to be inspired as you are and make this quit IT.             Welcome Sparky. So the single biggest piece of advice I got early on was only take it one day at a time. I kid you not for the first four month I just quit for the day. I didn't worry about tomorrow, or next week, or next month I just worried about one day, 24 hours... that's it. After the first day I knew I could do 24 hours... and this time, I armed myself with knowledge. I watched the videos and read the articles and watched the documentaries. Many here have had success with Alan Carr... there are those who have cold turkied and those who have used NRT. I just hit my 1 year. I feel so different to the first, big quit. I am more solid at a hair past 1 year than I was at 6 years last time. Seriously though I still tell myself every morning... I'm not going to smoke today.
Hi all, I just like to post randomly here because you all are a huge part of my success and I do not want that to be forgotten!   I was out this weekend for my birthday and so many smokers were around, I did not realize so many people still smoked, or maybe it was just social smoking as we were at a bar! I was drinking and the thought of smoking did pass my mind, I cannot lie...but it lasted for about 3 minutes and I did not give in!! I am proud. I knew I would hate myself.How is everyone doing and coping with the Holiday season?????
    Good stuff Christa! That exact situation has brought down many and unprotected quit and as you said, it gives nothing but regret in the end. Good for you that you recognized the situation and continued to just NOPE! That's the only way we can stay free forever - NOPE every day and never get complacent  It's so much easier to say no when you're this far along in your quit. Keep up the great work  
    Hi Christa, good to see you  And good job keeping that awesome quit of yours! Have a happy holiday season 
    Hello Christa ! I am so happy to hear you are protecting your precious quit !   Stay vigilant and Stay Free !
    Hi Christa, I can't believe there is smoking inside bars in N.Y.    You can not smoke inside restaurants, stores or public buildings in Ohio.   It is great you are breezing along through your quit.   Have a wonderful holiday season.    Linda

    Okay- it seems to have been a long time but here it is. Damn I feel good today !! First day without an overwhelming crave even for a minuet. I know it's not over but it felt GREAT for one day! I still have a few hours before sleep but have enjoyed it SO much so far. I just want it to continue. A person shouldn't have to want to feel this way. I just want to be able to say NOPE the rest of my days.        Have a great night everyone!
    Great, I love this Wantsit you are starting to see the benefits.  You are right it is not over yet but it is going to get better and it is going to get somewhat easier.  Good for you -- sleep good tonight!!!
Great stuff Wantsit! Like M5 says, you're just starting to see the real benefits of quitting and although you still have work to do, this gives you a taste of what everyday will be like pretty soon. The further you separate yourself from this addiction, the better and easier it will get. Enjoy the feeling
    Love this wantsit, I'm so happy for you. That very first day when you feel great is so awesome and shows you all your hard work is paying off  Have a great night and I hope your tomorrows are just as good 
    You are doing great, Wantsit.  You will still have ups and downs at this stage but it will slowly become a whole lot better.  I am glad you are starting to see the benefits to quitting.       Keep up the great work!
    Such a good thing to read Wantsit, you're doing great, and your enthusiasm is infectious.   KTQ!!!

    A big thank you to everyone!! I realize I have a much longer road ahead of me but I just want everyone to know that you all make it much easier. I look forward to just popping in here if only for a minuet each day. You have helped me make my life better by you knowing the feel of this! I have a high stress job so it would be easy to blame a relapse on that, but just the encouragement here along with the challenges to stay quit makes it different this time. Thank you!
    Just be sure to keep that positive attitude and that lovely quit Wantsit! We're here when you need us

Where does the temptation come from? Crap I haven't  had an issue for a week and all the sudden today I would have sold my soul for 5 minutes of pure smoking pleasure. I haven't an urge this strong since the first 3-4 days. I made it through but I can't explain how or where it came from  and it lasted almost all day. Ready for this business to stop!
You're in WTF week wantsit and now you know why we call it that. There's something about the 3's, 3 days, weeks, months, that get most of us. Just power through like you did today because it will get better
Going thru the nearly 3 month mark myself...one of the infamous 3's. Dig your heels in! Come here, take a shower, have a snack etc etc...just dont smoke! It will pass!
    Yes, wantsit, you are in the WTF week.  The craves come on strong and out of nowhere.  I kind of think it comes from the triggers that you were not fully aware of coming on, also your mind trying to become accustomed to no nicotine.  You can make it thru the week and things will start to look much better as you learn to deal with a nicotine free mind and body!!!!
It get's tiring at times early on but when it does, just go back to the basics. Breathing exercises to calm yourself. Hard candies or whatever your go-to pacifier is and remember .... why you wanted to quit! That's key! Would you really want to go back to nicotine slavery? I think not  Just do one day at a time for now. Still early days. You will get there if you do that.Edited November 20, 2018 by reciprocity
    Thanks all...I thought I was doing good but look at me...being a weakling and wasn't ready for this. Deep breaths. 
Hello Wantsit,  You are not a weakling, you are a hero to yourself, you quit smoking !      Each crave you beat is another receptor in your brain that you own again, another receptor wrenched away from nicotine addiction.       Here is something from The Mayo Clinic you may find interesting     "When you smoke, your brain changes in response to the very high levels of nicotine delivered by cigarettes.    Those brain changes cause you to become addicted to nicotine, and that addiction can make stopping smoking very difficult.  Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that keeps you smoking. Nicotine that gets into your body through cigarettes activates structures normally present in your brain called receptors.  When these receptors are activated, they release a brain chemical called dopamine, which makes you feel good.       This pleasure response to dopamine is a big part of the nicotine addiction process. Over time, as you continue to smoke, the number of nicotine receptors in your brain increases.Addicted smokers have billions more of these receptors than nonsmokers do.    When you try to stop smoking, the receptors in your brain do not receive nicotine, so the pleasure response is cut off. In addition, low levels of nicotine lead to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal,    such as strong cravings for a cigarette, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger and difficulty sleeping.   The fastest way to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms is to smoke a cigarette, which releases dopamine and activates the pleasure response.      To make stopping smoking even more difficult, the brain receptors can be conditioned to expect nicotine in certain situations long after you have stopped smoking.  For example, if you regularly smoke when you drink alcohol, or when you are in a stressful situation, or after a meal,  the nicotine receptors in your brain anticipate the dopamine rush from nicotine at that time.   These "trigger" situations can cause intense cravings for a cigarette, even if you have stopped smoking for several months.The good news is that once you stop smoking entirely, the number of nicotine receptors in your brain will eventually return to normal. As that happens, the craving response will occur less often, won't last as long or be as intense and, in time, will fade away completely. — Richard D. Hurt, M.D., Nicotine Dependence Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.          To be fair, our brains have to completely re-fit each receptor and this takes time. Even at five years quit, sometimes a rogue receptor will rear it's ugly head    but, it is easily dismissed.    Replace each smokey thought with something you choose.  Claim back each receptor.   Soon, they will behave and distribute your rewards suitably.    You can help them by rewarding yourself with a little something every time you beat a crave.        Stay focused, you are building a beautiful quit and amassing strength every day.    Nope-ly yours,  SEdited November 20, 2018 by Sazeracrogue for rouge. lol.

    Hoping today is a lot better for you 
@Wantsit Please continue to educate yourself on nicotine addiction...it has changed the chemisty of your brain. Sazerac gave good info above...there are scientific/medical reasons you are feeling like you are. Knowledge of the addiction takes away its power.  YOU are in control of you mind, not nicotine and you need to let junkie brain know that. Don't give smoky thoughts one ounce of romance because it can easily be manipulated and trigger the rest of your receptors to activate in desperation (think of a nursery and one baby starts crying...they ALL start crying)  Give a firm "NOPE! I'm a non-smoker!" Eat a small snack and move on to redirect brain activity.

    Thank you all. I wasn't prepared for the want yesterday, if you can call it that. I appreciate all the feed back. Today will be better.
    Tough times never last, but tough people do.
    Every battle you win...takes you nearer to winning your war ....well done ...
    I think the lesson here is to stay on point and prepared for possible triggers,  especially during the first year.      They really are sometimes shocking in their ferocity    but, they are just receptors in your brain that haven't read the New Rules,  yet.   NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE     
    You did good coming here to voice your concerns Wantsit. Keep doing that when something takes you by surprise because, almost for sure someone here will have experienced the same thing and can tell you what worked for them  
Endure it. When i was 3 months in i bought a pack and on my way home i passed by my brother´s house who is a bad mofo as he made a chest movement and said "endure it like a man". I will never forget the look in his eyes. The thing is, if you believe you will quit smoking without some disconfort and pain, well....i guess it could happen but it is unlikely. Grind your teeth and say nope. Nope through that motherfucker nicodemon. Im with you lad. Lets make it to one month, then ill make you a big celebration page in the cheers section. cmon!
    LOL!! Stewie. Thank you and you have a deal on the celebration! 
    When it comes to breaking an addiction like smoking, the shortest path is through the mud.      You're gonna be a mess before you're through, but when you're through you'll be pristine.
If at only 18 days into your quit you hadn't had an issue for the past week until these recent craves hit, you are waaaayyyy ahead of where I was at that time (hell, you're ahead of where I was 6 months later).   Start the celebration now and give yourself a toast for being the toughest quitter on the block.   Enjoy any good days (or hours or minutes) that you have very early on and grind your way through the bad ones, keeping the end game in sight when things are rough.  You really are doing beautifully, Wantsit, and now you've gotsit!

Hi Everyone,        I'm new to the site, but not new to quitting!       My quit date was 25/11/18 so my last fag was Sunday, well until 30 minutes ago. I have attempted to quit so many times before I have actually lost count. Each of my quits vary from 1 week to 12  months. Each break in quitting always comes back to handling stress or anxiety.      This quit is based on the east way and Jason Vales app. I have found this week really quite easy, one of the easiest yet. But today I have been faced with a stressful task a t work where I can't see a solution to a problem, so I have really craved. I used the SOS videos, went for a walk, did some deep breathing had something to eat and drink but still gave up and went to the shop. Now I have 20 fags (well 19 now) which I don't want but I know I will end up smoking!       I keep coming back to both of the above methods and their comments that we don't start smoking because we think it will help us with stress...BUT I did. When I was 12 years old (now 26), both my parents were very heavy smokers when I was growing up (one still is) and they always use to say 'I'm stressed I need a fag' so when I was 12 and in a state (of what I thought then to be) of stress I thought that the only was that I could get through it was to smoke and I genuinely thought (and still do, to some degree) that it stopped my stress.      So now  each time I am in a stressful situation I just don't seem to be able to get a handle on my emotions and smoke! Does anyone have any advice, please!?        Thank you and sorry for the long post!
Welcome to the board.  You have to accept and acknowledge that smoking does not relieve or cure stress.  What it does is relieve the withdrawal symptoms which makes you feel calmer for 30 minutes or so until the withdrawal symptoms come back.  You have to decide for yourself that there is no circumstance that it is okay to smoke.  NONE!  You are romancing the cigarettes and giving them power they do not have.   Quitting can be uncomfortable, even miserable some times,  but it will not kill you.  Smoking does not do one positive thing for anyone.
My dear Mrs Fowkes,     Initially, what you are getting are more cravings, your body sending signs saying "Oh no, all the nicotine is out of the system, how will we survive?" these red flags make you believe that you cannot operate without smoking.    Trust me, this time, your body is lying to you. You were not born with a smoke in your mouth, you've lived a decently large part of your life not smoking and the same holds true for the rest of it as well.       You have to work towards moving from one crave to the next initially, so the next time you do get a crave, just give yourself 4 minutes. If at the end of 4 minutes, you still feel like smoking, well, give yourself another 4.        in this interim, watch a funny video, read a small article, watch a favourite scene from a movie you love, listen to a great song, maybe twice, dance like no one's watching (that is if no one really is, unless you can dance, I have to lock myself in a room with 6 metres of aluminium before I can do my version of what's called a dance).   But just get through that crave, and very soon, the craves will lessen.     Everyone you meet on the train will vouch for that. The craves will lessen.     Soon you will see how it's better not to be bound by this habit, and not be a slave to it's whims and fancies.      Just take it and deal with it one crave at a time.      There's some really good advice Nancy gave, and many more seasoned quitters will certainly provide you with a lot of gems. Stay close to the forums, drink up on the knowledge, and pretty soon, we'll be celebrating your first month being quit.  Stay strong Mrs Fowkes, you're better than your habit, you're stronger than your habit.
Welcome to the site, Mrs Fowkes.@Nancy is absolutely correct,       19 minutes ago, Nancy said:             Welcome to the board.  You have to accept and acknowledge that smoking does not relieve or cure stress.  What it does is relieve the withdrawal symptoms which makes you feel calmer for 30 minutes or so until the withdrawal symptoms come back.  You have to decide for yourself that there is no circumstance that it is okay to smoke.                 When you want to quit, you Can quit.    When you commit to Not One Puff Ever you can have a successful quit.    You may find this post helpful   Ten Ways To Effectively Use This Forum
@Nancy@Sazerac  Thank you both very much! Advice well and truly accepted, especially the dance!     As I have broken the quit today there is no point in saying that I'm not going to have another today, that's not going to happen with the packet outside. I will give the packet to my husband and start again tomorrow. Definitely committing to the not one more puff ever.    
Hi MrsFowkes! You seem to have a pretty good understanding of what you are doing that is causing you to fail each time in your effort to stay quit. As others have said, the stress you are relieving by smoking is the stress cause by your nicotine addiction and the repeated association with smoking when you have life stress. Only you can break that cycle - no one else can do that for you. It's not easy for sure but everyone of us here has had to do the hard work to get to where we are and the good news is .... so can YOU!       Part of what you are doing when you light up a smoke in a stressful situation is you are just taking a small break to think about the situation and what you should do to get through it. You can still do that but without the smoke. Take a small break from what you;re doing and go for a walk or just to a different room and take some deep breaths, suck on a hard candy - whatever allows to to calm yourself so you can think about things. You might just find that works as well as having a smoke. Did having a smoke ever solve even 1 of your problems - I think not. Just gave you a distraction so you could think about things.        Stick around here. You will find the support top notch and that counts for a lot when you are struggling.  Go to our Daily NOPE page and pledge your nope every day. I think it will help.Edited November 30, 2018 by reciprocity
    Hello and welcome  aboard,  You have been given great advice...spend some time time here reading and Learning ....  Learn  all about the Lies ...Smoking offers you nothing ...life has problems whether you smoke or not ...smoking won't change anything ...it doesn't calm you ..its all Lies... It just relieved the withdrawal till you put nicotine back in your body.... It's so doable ...make the decision never to Stick anything in your mouth and set fire to it ...no matter what....  Looking  forward to getting to know you better ...
    Well now that you smoked, did the stress magically go away? Were you able to find a solution?       My guess is no...       Commit to not smoking. It really is as simple as that. Is it easy? No. But one you commit -and I mean really commit- to never smoke again, you can't fail.      You can make excuses until you're blue in the face (we all have), but really, it boils down to how committed you are. It's all or nothing, my friend.       Now stop smoking. Now.
One of the tips I received when my quit was new was to 'welcome the crave'.  Wish I could find those words to share with you.       The idea is - every time we hit a crave, it's an opportunity to beat it and for the quit to get stronger.  Once I understood that, I went out looking for the things that triggered an urge to smoke.  This allowed me to tackle the crave on my terms i.e. I was prepared rather than it creeping up on me unawares.  Then I would mentally play a game of beating it with a hammer and shouting 'die, crave, die'.        I stood with co-workers as they smoked, sat on the bench outside the library where I normally smoked, went outside the house after dinner, etc.  Doing this over and over again also helped prepare me for those occasional triggers that hit me unawares - I had a response I had practiced many times.        Everyone has their own way.  Lighting a cigarette will not cause the flat tire (or any situation) to improve.  We just need to learn to do these things without smoking.Edited November 30, 2018 by d2e8b8
This is mine: Beginning - through withdrawal: My plan - 6 weeks prior to quit date, I did a complete sugar detox (worse than nicotine!)  2 weeks prior I changed my brand to the weakest sort  The quit date: WalksShouting at myself NOPEGreen teaWaterBreathing exercises, 4 second in hold for 4, 4 seconds outReading and postingShowersSleepA straw with cotton wool in itHypnosis videos from YouTubeEating fruitListening to others, believingOne step at a time minutes, hours, daysStayed away from smokersNo wine until I was stronger Next 6 months: Reading and postingQuit buddiesPledging NOPEGoing for walks when crave hitLearning I had  quit not given up somethingFaced triggers early on, challenged my fearsRead my own pre SOS when junkie  thinking was aroundWatched my mum thinking I do not want to be like thatBrought nice things or did things with money savedAte like a horsePosted SOS 7 months until now: Quit buddiesReading and postingGetting fit now and healthy eatingTrigger or crave (stress)- time out, 5 minute walk or talk to myselfFinally accepting smoking willl do absolutely nothing for me or change the situationSmile I am a non smokerMoving forward into the positive changes the quit has brought my life   Would I change a thing at this point? Yes remove the WANT  the I can't, I must not Would have been so much easier from the beginning with just I DO NOT WANT!!!!! Still learning, still evolving.. Did anyone have a pre plan and what is in your quit tool box?
I didn't have a pre plan. I quit cold turkey without setting a date. I was sick, couldn't stop coughing, and asked myself why I continue torturing my lungs with nicotine? The first few months, I ate a lot of hard candies and chewed gum constantly. I'd go through a pack of gum in no time. I guess it kept my mouth busy and myself distracted, so I didn't crave as much.  I tried to drink a lot of water. This is extremely important. We (or at least I) have a habit of dehydrating myself and it was worse when I first quit.  I'd find something to do for hours and concentrate on that. I'd go to a movie or draw or read. Anything to keep my mind away from smoking.  I stayed away from smokers as well. I didn't visit my parents for a while until I felt more secure with my quit. I've been through hell with my quit, I'm not going to lie. It's not easy, but it's certainly doable and is the best decision you can make. The cravings you experience from quitting are only temporary, unlike the cravings you get as a smoker; the desperation you feel when you run out and don't have the money to buy more. 
Great advice Tracey... I had no prep, because my quit date wasn't planned... But 2 weeks after, I had -online support (reading and posting)-quit buddies-chewing a load of gum-playing with a 'tangle'-walks-doing stuff around the house (DIY, cleaning)
Oh good one! I planned mine like a military manouvre! Champix 2 weeks before one day before -joined smoking quit site, knew I would need support.Bought sweets, lots of sweets!!And peanuts, you can't be too prepared, 4 types :)And a bottle for water, cause ok, healthy living lolREAD Quit dateStunned self actually not smoking.Ate entire stash of sweets, peanuts and sloshed with water consumptionDecided more reading was needed.Read whyquit, cried a lot Days after that all blended.Shouted nope and danced from foot to foot a lotClicked my fingers when I cravedPurchased 2 boxes of peanuts (nobby's chilli nuts) from cash and carryAte a shedload of foodTreated myself to a value of treats higher then I would spend smoking lolCleaned my floor - a lot. Actually cleaned when I craved a lot, it helped to keep busy I'm not helping really but I'm happy and relaxed now.  What I will say, I wish I had of exercised sooner!!  Or walked!! Both eliminate craves and produce a really healthy feel good vibe that I really enjoy now and I didn't believe those who said it did.
Picked a date Read Allen Carr. Date was going to be the day I returned from vacation. 11 hour flight I thought would be useful. Quit a couple of days early, on vacation and decided I would accompany La B on her smokes. Thoughts/tools 1. Nobody can make me smoke. Or Quit. It is entirely up to me.2. Forever? Too much. I won't smoke today. Tomorrow? We will see about that tomorrow. 3. Smoke break? Let's walk.4. Crave? Talk to it.
I didn't have a pre plan. I quit cold turkey without setting a date. I was sick, couldn't stop coughing  Mine was the same as yours Lennna. I had always wanted to but never did. I remember thinking how pathetic I was after that coughing fit.  I wondered why I was still smoking and realized I had given up control of my health and my life to cigarettes. I wanted to quit then. At that time I remember thinking that to quit I would have to lose myself as I existed up to that point in time. The realization that I could never, ever smoke again filled me with such a sadness. I was seeing a stranger, someone who was going to lose his best friend, and I was scared. I could not see myself doing that. But I went on with that mind trip, and just did CT with a couple of weeks of Chantix. I realized later that in that moment of truth I was breaking the chains of my addiction. I had found my quit. (this will give you an insight into my tolerance for risk, I had to see it to make it real. But I couldn't see that what I had done for 35 years was risky). It is hard to break this addiction down and get real with it. Markus
Its nice seeing the term "quit toolbox" being used.  So many start a quit w/o a clue & thats sad cause those are the poor souls almost doomed to failure. Glad to see you had a solid plan-hopefully some "newbie" will think wow what a great idea. :D  :wub: 
I did a lot of reading before hand especially about being prepared for the mental aspects.  I had to have a "no loophole" argument in my mind for every crave.   I put a worry stone in my left hand front pocket where I used to carry cigarettes. I avoided people, places and things that I thought would be bad triggers until I was sure I could handle them.  I knew the phrase, "there are no extra points for making quitting harder."   I kept my focus on quitting, number one priority.  
A toolbox is a excellent idea! It will give you the tools you need to fight the cravings and fix your addiction! I did not have one, All i had was some nicorette gum, a bad chest cold, and the desire to quit! I got through it but was very hard and had i prepared myself with a tool box maybe i could of quit years ago! First item in my tool box would be the: QUIT TRAIN!
I didn't prepare either me and my wife decided not to buy any more on a whim   and 4 days latter I found a quit smoke sight for support and I lurked for a while reading post before I joined but it helped me to stay quit im so  glad I joined and stayed quit    learn all you can about this addiction and the nicotine withdrawal that you can read post and learn have a plan   so your quit will be better and youll know what to expect    if I can quit anybody can    :D :D

I was at a point where I absolutely hated smoking and couldn't justify it to myself. So even though I hadn't prepared myself, I felt ready to commit. 
This is a great collection of posts.What's in your tool box ?  What else would you add ? In my tool box was desire, education, determination, distraction, a mantra of 'Free Your Head',water, satsumas, screaming hot showers, beautiful deep breaths of oxygen, cleaning... I would add Rewards , now that I know more about nicotine's theft of natural pleasure centers. ,

    Didn’t have plan. Had extreme luck, though, that first two weeks were relatively easy. In that time I did a lot of reading, discovered qsmb and realized why I hadn’t succeeded before. All the tools and habits appeared after quitting, water, meditation apps, support group, exercise. More luck than common sense

I wasn't here yet so i know it wasn't mine.        Ok so I do not think I had much of a "quit tool box". For the first time in my life i was pumped about quitting. I mean I REALLY wanted it. I guess if I had a tool box of sorts - I was planning on smashing my cigarette machine with a hammer one month into my quit. Yeah one month just in case I decided to relapse.  To be God-honest, I did not think I would last as a non smoker. Somehow I did though. But yeah i ended up giving the machine to my sister who was gonna give it to our nephew.  I didn't really explain how to use it but figured he would probably learn. After all, he was 8 years old, he could read the instructions well enough. Ok kidding aside, he was over 30.     So I ditched everything smoking related. That was a physical tool.  My motivation to stay quit was the biggest thing.   ONE tool though, and I hope no one else suffers this - close to Thanksgiving in 2017, I ended up with cellulitis (it is NOT smoking related). It was the WORST ailment I have ever had. All I wanted to do was lay around and suffer. during those couple weeks, i wasn't gonna do jack crap to make myself feel worse. Long story short, life SUCKED during that time. Short of cash, thanksgiving ruined, it was cold, work sucked, etc.      The point is, you know Mr Titwank would probably enjoy it.
Oh my...I didn't have a tool box. I did have a journal I wrote 25 years before I actually quit...all about how I didn't want to be forced to quit...and the reasons why smoking sucked and why I needed to stop smoking but that didn't happen at that time...I just went on my merry way smoking like a chimney!       2017- It was do or die for me now....I quit while on way to hospital while having a stroke!     While in hospital I let staff know I was gonna need the patch to get through this...and they provided it! I gritted my teeth and played Solitaire on my phone for hours at a time and then I would try to sleep (not easy when in hospital!)        Once I got back home, I was filled with anxiety....knowing that I had to keep this quit or else! I had really damaged my body and more horrible stuff was to come in the next few months (CABGx3)!      I managed to keep my quit by finding an online support group (QSMB) and deep breathing, admitting I was an addict and educating myself. Every time a crave hit....I was off walking which was a miracle in itself!! I had survived a stroke with no lasting damage!     When I had hit my one year quit milestone, I was so thankful! One month later QSMB was no more!!! Ack....I knew I still needed support...luckily found the Quit Train!      What is in my toolbox now:      Smoking is not an option - it is damaging my arteries and my lungs. The fact that I now have seen that my skin looks better, my eyes look better, I no longer stink, I no longer have that awful cough.     I have the power to say NO to a crave.  I am educated about the addiction.  I am strong.    I am powerful.
Just read that Washington DC increased the cigarette tax by $2 per pack, bringing the taxes up to $5 per pack, and the average cost of a pack to $10, which according to the article is now the highest in the US.  Read the article here       As the article points out though, all smokers have to do is take a quick trip to either MD or VA where the taxes are much lower.
    Va I can understand because that's tobacco country isn't it?    Taxing the smokes is a double edge sword though because the Gov't then gets used to the revenue so punishing the industry down the road becomes more and more difficult.

I guess it depends on whether you live closer to VA or MD as to where they have to get their fix.
    When California implemented the fire safe cigarettes a year or two before the federal government did I would have my mom or sis send me cartons from Florida. A smoker will always find a way around for their addiction. But we can hope by raising the cigarette taxes so high it will discourage people from starting to smoke

Where I live, every time the government raises the cig taxes, the black market in cigarettes goes into high gear and involves the indigenous communities and their own cigarette manufacturing and distribution business.  As has been said, people find a way when they have to. As Doreen said though, perhaps it's enough to discourage younger peeps from starting.     That's where I think there's a bigger threat in the vaping area though - young people just staring out. They are trying to make it look like the thing to do. I have heard countless radio adds in the past week or so for some Vape company where they are offering a free vape "starter kit" to people between the ages of 19 & 21 (conditions apply) yeah like you have to commit to buying so many vials of vape juice or something I'm sure.       Openly luring young people into vaping though - that's just wrong!!
In 2016, when I still smoked, I voted for the $2 cigarette tax here in CA. I'd been wanting to quit for some time anyway and figured the extra $2 a pack would be the push I need (which it was).
I don't believe Eric would mind if I share his post, here.  It is imported from QSMB.       FILLING THE PAGES by Eric   A common topic a quitter might talk about since they quit smoking, is the fact that there seems to be void in their life now. Now that they're not smoking it feels as if the days have grown longer and they are unsure of how to fill this time. Sometimes this can actually put stress the new quitter, because this is so unfamiliar to them.   Cigarettes have been so deeply intertwined in their life for so long, that the new quitter is constantly being reminded that they no longer smoke just from everyday activities.    They may ask how do they unwind after work now that they don't smoke? How do they deal with stress, now that they don't smoke? How do they punctuate finishing a task now that they don't smoke?    For the smoker, that cigarette after finishing a task was like putting the period at the end of sentence. Now that they don't smoke, daily tasks can just feel like a long running sentence with no punctuation.    The cigarette was also like the smoker's pause button. If they needed to concentrate on doing something or were under a stressful situation. They would step back, smoke a cigarette and think about how to resolve the problem. Now that they don't smoke, there doesn't seem to be a pause button for the quitter. That magic button that says" Whoa give me a minute" is now gone. Now they are just left with the situation and a very unfamiliar way that they now have to deal with it without the cigarette.     One thing that should be pointed out though, is that we have lived our lives and dealt with stress DESPITE smoking, NOT because of it.  There was a fellow quitter that was talking about this and it was really stressing her out. She was having a hard time dealing with stress and everyday scenarios without smoking. She was getting discouraged about this and felt that her life just felt kind of empty since she quit. She felt that there was now a void in her life.    One thing she said though, that I thought was an interesting way to look at it, was that she said that since she quit smoking, was that she felt she now had to rewrite her life.   When I read this, for some reason it reminded me of someone writing a screenplay about the day in the life of a smoker. This is what it might say.  -----------------------------------------------------------------   THE DAY IN THE LIFE OF A SMOKER.    Dear (anonymous)    I'm just making this up, but let's just say this is how your typical day when you smoked would look like.   You wake up. Smoke a cigarette. You get ready for work. Smoke a cigarette. You have breakfast. Smoke a cigarette. You get in your car and drive to work. Smoke a cigarette. You get to work. Smoke a cigarette before going inside. You go to coffee break at work. Smoke a cigarette. You go to lunch. Smoke a cigarette. You go to second break. Smoke a cigarette. Maybe something stressful happens at work. Sneak out and smoke a cigarette. After work, as you drive home, you smoke a cigarette. You get home and unwind. Smoke a cigarette. You cook dinner. Smoke a cigarette. After eating dinner. Smoke a cigarette. Have a glass of wine or beer and of course smoke a cigarette. Watch TV. Smoke a cigarette. Get ready for bed. Smoke a cigarette. Before going to bed. Smoke a cigarette.    Let's say that it took 5 pages to write the screenplay "In the daily life of (anonymous)."  Now that you don't smoke, you're not so much rewriting your daily life, but more of editing out a lot of useless dialog in your screenplay that isn't needed to tell the story.     The problem is that now after all that editing, what use to take 5 pages to tell the story, now only takes 3 pages. Now you still have 2 blank pages that you're carrying around with you and you don't know what to do with them. This can cause anxiety. You have been so used to writing your daily life with 5 pages that writing it with only having to use 3 pages feels like there is a void in the story.   Really take a look at the dialog that you edited though and put that down on the 2 remaining pages.     Here's what it would say: Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. etc, etc.   You can see how useless this dialog is. It doesn't even help tell your story and on it's own it makes no sense. It's just repeated blabber.     You have two choices now. You can either take these pages and just throw them away, because you no longer need them anymore. Or you can take these two remaining pages and add something to your story. Something that maybe you've wanted to add for sometime now, but just have never done it, because this addiction was taking up those two pages. These two pages are no longer being wasted on telling the story of your addiction. They are now yours to tell any story that you wish to tell.   It isn't so much that since you quit smoking, that there is a void in your life. It is more that smoking created that void, because it took away from you. That was YOUR time being wasted, it was NOT being filled. Now that you have freed yourself from cigarettes, don't think of it as leaving a hole in your life. Think of it as giving back the endless possibilities of living life as YOU again.  Also don't think that you need a cigarette to deal with life's stress.  It isn't that you were able to deal with stress better when you smoked. It's just that you've done it for so long that way, that you are having to relearn how to do it without cigarettes. It's new and unfamiliar. Smoking under stress was a combination of relieving withdrawal, but it also gave you a minute or two to reflect on what was causing the initial stress.    If you're under stress and where the times you would smoke a cigarette, what I would do is stop. Step back and give yourself a moment just like you would do when you smoked, but now breathe deeply, calm yourself and focus on what you need to do to alleviate what is causing the stress.   Don't feel that if you're under stress that you have to attack it head on because cigarettes are no longer there to buffer what it happening. You can very easily do this without smoking. You can step back and give yourself a moment to collect yourself and you can do it without cigarettes. They are a useless middleman and you know that cigarettes don't relieve stress. They only relieve withdrawal. They don't deserve that kind of credit.     You should be proud of yourself, because you have taken your pages back.    The pages are yours now. Fill them any way you choose   Eric
    Thanks for posting this,        Eric made some wonderful posts !!!          Cristóbal
I know there is a split on this forum about regulating cigarettes.  With that in mind, I'll leave it up to each individual to decide if this is overdue or over-reach.      The Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday that it will seek a ban on the sale of menthol-flavored cigarettes.     The announcement came as the agency officially released a detailed plan to also restrict the sale of flavored electronic cigarettes. It also wants to ban flavored cigars.      In a statement, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb says the moves are aimed at fighting smoking among young people. Flavored e-cigarettes, menthol-flavored tobacco cigarettes and flavored cigars are all popular among teenagers.        "Today, I'm pursuing actions aimed at addressing the disturbing trend of youth nicotine use and continuing to advance the historic declines we've achieved in recent years in the rates of combustible cigarette use among kids," Gottlieb says.        While cigarette smoking has hit a record low in the United States, vaping has been skyrocketing. That trend has raised concerns that a new generation of young people will become addicted to nicotine.         Gottlieb says the moves were prompted by new data showing a 78 percent increase in e-cigarette use among high school students and a 48 percent increase among middle school students, from 2017 to 2018.        "These data shock my conscience," Gottlieb says.        The ban on menthol, in particular, has been long sought by public health authorities and antismoking advocates. The concern is that the flavoring masks the harshness of tobacco smoke, making it easier for people to start smoking.       "I believe these menthol-flavored products represent one of the most common and pernicious routes by which kids initiate on combustible cigarettes," Gottlieb says.     Menthol cigarettes are especially popular among African-Americans, leading some to charge that tobacco companies have been using the flavoring to target minorities.     To read this story in its entirety, please go to this linkhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/11/15/668192356/fda-seeks-ban-on-menthol-cigarettes-to-fight-teen-smoking
    Personally I'l be happy if they ban Menthol cigarettes, as that was all I ever smoked, non menthol gave me migraines.... sooo if they ban them I know I will never ever be given a chance to relapse.   That makes me happy  
    It doesn't bother me at all if the ban menthol ciggies  Any step in the right direction to stop young people from starting is a good thing.      It bothers me more that they are not doing enough to regulate the whole Vape industry. I know up here in the Great White North, they advertise on radio, TV and anywhere they please. Having flavored vape liquid makes me crazy. Clearly that is done to induce younger people to "give it a try"? I guess before there's clear evidence of danger in vaping, there won't be much action on that front!
    I'm not sure how I feel about this, but as a lifelong Kool smoker (w/a brief flirtation with Marlboros in my teens), I have always thought that Kools were more addictive than any other cigarettes.  This is partly based on the fact that I was the only smoker I know of who would not smoke any other brand (not even one cigarette), including other menthols, if I ran out of Kools.  I would walk/drive any distance to get more Kools, even if another brand was right at hand and offered to me.  I did switch from Kools to Kool Milds, but that was about it.  For me, banning Kools would have been about the same as banning cigarettes altogether.

I'm up and down like a flippin yoyo weather I'm for or against banning smokes completely....but I do think that once smokes are banned then all nicotine products should be banned. So either I live under a rock or vaping down here just isn't the thing it is up north.... Its around, I'm see it more and more... and seriously I I can taste the strawberry flavour in the 'not smoke' cloud 10 meters away what the fruck is it doing to the deluded jukies 'smoking' it?????.... so I have never seen or heard advertising for vapes over here and I spose I have just assumed it fulls under the total ban that applies to tobacco..... will look into it... and let you know. I spose if my goverrnment decided to outlaw ciggies and vapes I'd back and support them but I'm just as likely to get splinter in me arse sittin on the fence on this one.
I'm all for it! I wish they would take all nicotine products from stores and only be allowed to sell from age regulated "smoke shops". (I know this will never happen because the money)        They just passed some regulations on Juul tho, it's a step in the right direction.https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/13/juul-stops-selling-e-cigarette-flavors-social-media-promotions/   Vape is a big thing in my small town...we have 3 churches, 2 convience type stores, McDonald's and 2 independent vape shops. Very sad "downtown" drive.
    If I had read this a couple of weeks ago I would have been marching into this thread like Rambo, firing my machine guns in the air      Now that I completely "get" nicotine addiction I feel differently.      I am all for any change that is going to save future generations from smoking.      It's a killer addiction      
I hate cigarettes.  I hate big tobacco.     That being said, I don't think outlawing tobacco is the answer.  Here in America at least, the prohibition of alcohol was an abysmal failure.  Our "war on drugs" has been an exercise in futility that has stumbled in place for over a half-century.  The law of unintended consequences always rears its head in these situations.  Not only will we not alleviate the current smoking problem by banning tobacco, we will have to deal with a host of new issues arising from yet another black market.     Ironically enough, programs intended to curb and eventually eliminate underage smoking are easier to implement so long as tobacco is legal.  Ban tobacco and the black market will be a free-for-all.Edited November 21, 2018 by Boo
Legislation has already been passed in the European Union to ban menthol cigarettes and will be implemented May 2020. This has come as part of the European Tobacco Products Directive passed into law in May 2016. There is a rumour that as part of BrexIt this piece of legislation may be torn up.      Personally I am for people to have their own freedom of choice, rather than state believing that they should make choices on behalf of everyone. Menthol allowed or not is kind of borderline though.
    I'm on the fence doing the yo yo thing like jo, but either ban nicotine or don't.  Picking and choosing the flavors allowed, as well as mostly taking a let's wait and see if it causes people to grow horns and extra toes while their lungs deflate attitude towards e-cigs and vaping, isn't likely to accomplish much.  
    I'm for getting rid of menthol. That was all I smoked and I would choose to go without than smoke a regular puff..      Now with the vape thing I thing they should ban all the silly flavours, you wanna sook in nicotine then don't candy coat it.. and I am well sick of walking through clouds of canyfloss and tootyfruity that goes on for miles.... why..  just .. why....!!
Today I read my Day 4 material from Joel Spitzer as usual, but I also learnt something by myself.       The last three days were tough in places and if there was a day to throw in the towel it would have been yesterday. I woke up this morning and I realised I felt great.         If I had given up on this quit yesterday I wouldn't have experienced the great day I had today.         I am now in Day 5.       Edited November 17, 2018 by Lilly
    Good for you, Lilly.   Yeah, if you had given up yesterday, you would have felt horrible.  I'm glad you didn't.     You are doing a great thing by quitting smoking.  Embrace that fact and protect your quit.   Keep up the awesome work!
    Good for you, Lilly! One day at a time....and they really start to add up!
    I'm so happy for you Lilly with each and every day you tackle! You're doing it girlfriend!!

    Happy Day Five for Lilly.    
    Keep up the good work!      There are going to be good days and bad days, but really, every day you're smoke free is a good day and one day closer to freedom.      Stay strong! You don't want to have to go through this ever again!
    Keep going Lilly.  It gets easier every day!

    Hey all     I was thinking of why this Forum works. As you participate you are building something over time. You can form relationships with individuals, hear advice from the group, help others maintain their quit, and make a daily NOPE pledge. All this adds up to a meaningful "thing". The "thing" begins to act as a counterbalance to the urge to smoke. When I have cravings I think of this forum first. It is not guilt, (they will judge me), but more of a feeling that I would be sacrificing all that I have done.  It is making this quit different. During other quits the urge to smoke was meet with abstract ideas of negative consequences. These were often flimsy and wouldn't hold up. This is a strong, positive, structure we are building. And it works.
    Very well said kdad, very well said !!!!
    Great post kdad, and that's what worked for me too  
    That's lovely Kdad 
    I agree. I am not one for social media. Don't even have a Face-Plant account but this place is different.   There's a purpose to it and I was very pleasantly surprised at how effective it was once I joined up. Not sure I would have made it on my own?
    When I hopped on the Train, I had serious doubts about all online forums.       That was two years and eight months ago.  And...I'm still here.     The Train rolls on.

    Very good post!! I feel connected to everyone's quit and want to help carry their load when it gets heavy and share in their joys with each milestone!  This place works. There is so much POWER here! 
    Kdad,  I feel the same about this forum.  I know that if I had not stumbled across it, I would still be smoking.  These wonderful friends, from around the world guided me through the difficulties of quitting smoking and made me feel the true strength inside me.  Pledging and helping others continues to solidify your own quit.

    One week -- so important -- well done and enjoy the day
A week not smoking (based on a pack-a-day habit):       A day of your life saved.           Saving 35 USD or 27 GBD or 2 troy ounces of triple 9 fine silver (that's 10 pounds of pure silver yearly!).         Approximately 16 hours doing something else besides smoking.   Oh, the possibilities....
    Yay for you and Congrats! Rewards are soooo important!! Most important...your health!
    Well done!!!
Should you come across moments when quitting seems too arduous,when you feel like you just can't take it anymoreyou must forge ahead, faking it if needed,  to get through another day.  You must shake yourself and understand againthat this is just an addictionand you are the conqueror.    Smoking will not make your frustration or your withdrawal go away.Smoking is all about the management of withdrawal.        These moments of despair or frustration that your mind is not yet freeare not long lived and not commands for you to smoke.They are opportunities for you to introduce new ideas, new rewards to your brain.    Change your thoughts, use a physical or a visual prompt. Be your own dominant/dominatrix.Insist your body obey you and release it from the captivity of nicotine addiction.The rewards will be awesome.  No kidding.

    I have been in a constant cycle of quit/relapse/quit/relapse for such a long time and it's exhausting.      If you are in that relapse cycle too and really want to quit, educate yourself properly by watching the Joel Spitzer videos on this forum, head over to the WhyQuit website to watch even more and spend lots of time here for support, encouragement and distraction.      A good starting point if you are planning to quit is on the link below.      https://whyquit.com/joel/dayzero.htm    
    Hi Lilly,       I am glad you have been using these resources, they certainly have helped so many people quit smoking over the years.       The education you are getting is critical to helping you put your mind in the right place, and finally ending this awful cycle.     The support from this forum is also very important. There is almost always somebody here to help if you have a bad day.     Both education and support are key in their own ways, and both will help you finally end this awful cycle.          Cristóbal        
    Thankyou Cristobal 
    Yeah I have been thinking about quitting myself.
Day 3 was difficult as I have been extremely emotional. I am not sure if I can explain my feelings in words but will try.       I was watching my Day 3 videos by Joel Spitzer and there was one that I had watched before. When I watched it the first time I felt sad but continued to smoke. When I watched it earlier it brought out feelings in me that I didn't even realise were there.      After watching it today I sobbed for hours for my own mum. I watched my mum die due to smoking and then I smoked my way through her death, her funeral and then during a very long period of grief.         Today I feel as though I am going through a second cycle of grief. My beautiful mum was taken from us because she was addicted to smoking. This thought has tortured me most of the day and my heart is breaking for her.       I'm seeing this addiction for what it really is and I'm angry. I'm keeping that anger for another day though as today I need to cry only for my mum.        I'm now in Day 4.Edited November 14, 2018 by Lilly
It's good to see you Lilly, your feelings are all normal at this stage of your quit. I too lost both my dad and my uncle (his little brother) to smoking related cancer. And I too smoked through it all and continued for the next 14 years after my dad passed.   We can't change the past, we can only learn from it...….    Well done on getting through day 3 and now being on day 4. You're doing great!  xoxo
    Oh dear, Lilly, Smoking leaves a sad and tragic legacy to any survivors of a smoke related illness.     I am so sorry you lost your Mother. Grieving takes a long time and comes up unexpectedly years and years after you thought your grief was complete. Give yourself time and space whenever grief comes up for you.   It is all part of the healing journey.      Smoking hid so many of our deep feelings.   I used to think I was in touch with my feelings but, after I quit and so many feelings came tumbling down,  I realized the veil of smoke hid so much.  So much.     Be kind to yourself and give yourself a reward for this day.    Tomorrow, will dawn a new day.
Oh Lilly, I am so sorry.  We all looked past the ones we lost to smoking.  Ignoring reality was the only way that legitimized our continued smoking.  We were all going to be the lucky ones.   Fortunately we had the opportunity to see it for what it was.   I am so glad you have made it through day 3.  It sounds as if you have turned a corner by being able to relate so differently to the films. Your still in the tough period.  Your emotions will probably be all over the place. Take care and hang tough.  You are doing great!
Lilly thanks for posting this.  I too went through the same thing, except that I smoked for many years after even though I was angry about what smoking had done to my mother.  It is strange how this addiction works.  The emotions you are going thru are par for course -- keep strong and keep coming back-- you are doing fantastic.  Congrats on getting thru day 3!!!!!!
    Keep marching
Thankyou everyone Edited November 15, 2018 by Lilly
I am sorry Lilly and I’m proud of you and your strength. Usually day 3 is critical and cravings peak then, most probably it’s related to nicotine leaving the body. With each day it’s goingto be easier. Take care!
I am so sorry to read this, Lilly.  Smoking truly is horrible.      Congratulations on making it through day 3.  Keep fighting.  Your quit will get easier with time.
The first day is done and I am giving myself a massive pat on the back and having my own little celebration.        I'm really proud that I got through today. Mentally wasn't too bad and physically it was bearable. Only negative is I have a really big ulcer in my mouth which is so painful and no amount of Bonjela will help.       Joel Spitzer has put together videos to watch during the first week which are on the link below. I watched all the Day 1 section today and learnt so much, plus it was a great way to keep busy.        I'm now in Day 2.    https://whyquit.com/joel/index-guide.html
Great job   Say NOPE a bunch.   Drink some fruit juice- blood sugar will be low. Nicotine releases it somehow and your going to be out of whack for a week.     On to "bakon only advise". Nobody else will tell you this. ...ready.  Notebook out....      outside of this group, not many will know the struggle of the first couple days. Not many pat on the backs. Good jobs are few and rare.   So even your closest humans might not notice....as a result You must REWARD YOURSelf  .  Think of some little object you want but never pick up. An ice cream, a magazine, a hair brush, a book.  Anything small and self satisfying.     Buy it. you earned it.      every day for first week you must REWARD YOURSelf.  It reinforces the quit. It might be the only praise you receive on some days.   Now when you leave house don't forget....NOPE and a reward.  Edited November 13, 2018 by bakon
    Congratulations, Lilly on your first few days of Freedom.   NOPE your way through the coming days.  I am glad you find Joel helpful,  I (and many others) did as well.  It was through him that I finally understood my addiction   and this knowledge became the premier tool in building my quit.      
Congratulations on getting past day 1 Lilly  Now it's just a matter of repeating day 1 over and over again to get your forever quit. I read your blog yesterday and loved your quit song. So much so that I started a quit song thread in the social section if you'd like to put it there. Maybe it'll help someone else also
    Well done Lilly.. You should be proud of yourself!  Yes keep as busy as you can no matter how much out of your comfort zone it is & just ride the emotions because they will be up and down.    Were all with you 
    Thanks for your posts guys. It makes such a big difference to have the congratulations 
    Well done Lilly, you are on your way -- and take to heart what Bakon said above, it is so true.
    Aye well done Lilly, just keep going!! 
    Congratulations Lilly! Another day almost done!
    Thanks so much. I'm going to post the first three days just to keep the excitement 
    Post everyday. I did for a while. Add to it occasionally.   Then post on other people threads. Spend time in here. It’s free and works.             Find my thread Starting Now.  
    Thankyou everyone 
Day 2 is done but today I felt a little less upbeat than yesterday.         The ulcer in my mouth seems to have moved it's friends in. I can now feel a few ulcers which is making eating virtually impossible due to the pain. I'm drinking plenty but I think I really could do with a proper meal. I thought I would have some soup tonight but for some reason I didn't even enjoy it. I don't know if that's because of the ulcers, if my taste buds are changing or if it's the two tubes of Bonjela I have tucked in my cheeks.      In a perverse way I'm actually enjoying what withdrawal is bringing. This is the worst quit physically I have ever had but I stuck it out and another day is done.      I watched all the Joel Spitzer Day 2 videos today and gained more knowledge to keep me focused on the end goal.         I'm now in Day 3.Edited November 13, 2018 by Lilly
    Yay Lilly, you're doing it  AND you'll never have to go through those first two days again as long as you stay quit  Have you tried gargling with warm salt water for your ulcers? 
    I'm sorry to hear about your ulcers, Lilly, but keep up the great work with your quit.  As Jill said, make this your forever quit and you will not have to go through this again.
Yes those ulcers can be a pain but you are handling it well.  I agree with Jillar, try some warm salt water gargles to see if that will help.  Great job on getting thru day 2.
    Way to go Lilly.  Just keep hanging tough.  In the beginning it just seems to go so slow.  That nicotine will soon be out of your system and then it is just a matter of retraining your brain.  I do hope your ulcers heal soon.  I am sure your physician has given you the best treatment for them.  I do know how painful they are.

Those first cigarettes were not something we liked at the beginning.     We had to pay the price of coughing and feeling dizzy, to become a proud smoker.        That was what happened when we opened the smoking door to the addiction, years ago.         Now, you must go through the same door to get out of where you were.        The price of your exit, is withdrawl symptoms, however the process of leaving involves much more time and discomfort.           Smoking sucked when we started.     Smoking sucked when we smoked.      Smoking sucked when we stopped.         What does this tell you ???     Your perverse feelings of enjoying withdrawl, show that you have had enough of this garbage.            Keep going and never look back, there was never anything good about smoking, it all sucked -  you are doing excellent !!!           Cristóbal                                                                Edited November 14, 2018 by Cristóbal

How are you doing on your day 3, @Lilly?
    Thank you everyone 
https://www.yahoo.com/news/fda-gives-e-cigarette-makers-183914968.html      It's a start...I watched 2 young boys walk down my block passing a vape thing between them...huge clouds of white following them. Very sad...prob stole it from their parents and filled it with nicotine that taste like candy.
    Yes, it is a start. I have friends who are letting their teenage son vape in front of them even though neither of them have ever smoked! Supposedly the vape is nicotine free but some studies say that there are other chemicals in them besides nicotine that are hooking these kids 
Will these kids go from vape to a crack pipe? Oxygen is all we should put in our lungs....          WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People who smoke high-voltage e-cigarettes have greater exposure to formaldehyde, a suspected carcinogen, than those who keep the voltage low, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.   The study, which critics say is misleading and lacks context, is the latest contribution to a debate on the safety of e-cigarettes that has so far has yielded little long-term data, though most experts believe they are less toxic than combustible cigarettes.  Researchers from Portland State University took flavored nicotine liquid made by Halo Cigs, a private company, and tested it in a personal vaporizer from Innokin. The vaporizer allows consumers to adjust the voltage from 3.3V to 5.0V. The higher the voltage the greater the nicotine kick, but also the greater the amount of formaldehyde.   E-cigarette liquids typically contain propylene glycol, which when heated is known to release formaldehyde gas. "Vaping" at high voltage also produced formaldehyde-containing compounds known as hemiacetals, the researchers found.Edited September 13, 2018 by Whispers
    Thank you Whispers...this is scarey stuff ,to read for our yougens...   It's hard to imagine what damage this will do in time.....  After all ..we were told it was OK go smoke....well my generation ....  Havn,t enough folks died ..to make a profit.....     
    I've said it before and I'll repeat myself once more: big tobacco is well aware of the current trends in nicotine delivery systems.  The same merchants of death who peddled the deadliest consumer product in the history of the world have diversified and are now heavily invested in the e-cig market.  Only the gadget is new.  The bullshit is the same as it ever was.
    I've met adults who think they've quit smoking because they switched to vape or E-Cig.   No point in arguing with them, you won't win.
    ^^My sister is one of them! 
    OK... so the big argument is "its less toxic than combustible cigarette" .... IT'S STILL TOXIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      So, lets say I took a shit on your lounge room floor... and it was a huge one, would make a cow feel inadequate about its pats huge... and say I took a shit in your rumpus room but it was tiny, I mean there was hardly any shit there at all.. that second shit, that was less shit than the first one, would be ok because its less shit, right? Yeah-Nah... shit is shit and toxins are toxins.... no level should be acceptable and I can guarantee there would be an issue if I shit in any room of your houses regardless of how big or small it was... so how then can it be acceptable that less toxins are ok. Seriously??       Arguing that LESS toxins makes it better is complete bullshit! How do they get away with this????       OK... so maybe a bit controversial here but if I had a loved one who didn't want to quit and they switched to NRT gum... I'd be happy with that as a smoking alternative... but vaping.. nope just as bad as far as I am concerned.  
Nope, I agree, big shit/little shit... all stinks.

    The worst part of vaping is that it is the douchebag method of ingesting nicotine. Kind of like driving a Toyota Prius. They walk around doing that vaping crap like it is SOOOO cool.      Also, they claim vaping is less toxic than cigarettes. Somehow I find that hard to believe. Think of this also - a smoker puts off a little bit of smoke with each exhale. A vape slave though puts off more smoke/steam/whatever than a ninja ever did.

I have a friend from high school who NEVER would have smoked cigarettes back in the day.  20 years later, he now vapes and sees nothing wrong with it.      Yeah, big tobacco knows exactly what they are doing in hooking this next generation of nicotine users, mostly kids but also adults who never would have smoked nasty-smelling tobacco cigarettes.

    Vaping is like,  like something you would have seen in the Twilight Zone when they were in the future.      Electric cigarettes.        Pretty crazy.
The first patent for an electronic cigarette was filed in 1927.... the first commercially viable one had a patent filed in 1963... but none of the tobacco companies would take it up, it is believed they were just waiting for the patent to expire so they could get the tech for free.... its nothing new but its like they sat on it until cigarettes became so unviable that it was time to have a plan B ready to go... which just makes me even angrier at big tobacco.

November 14 is World Diabetes Day and if you're looking for yet another of the 50 million already available excuses to quit and stay quit why not quit to help prevent yourself developing type 2 diabetes or for those of you who already have diabetes... quit now to improve your diabetes management.       We now know that smoking causes type 2 diabetes. In fact, smokers are 30–40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than nonsmokers. And people with diabetes who smoke are more likely than nonsmokers to have trouble with insulin dosing and with controlling their disease.The more cigarettes you smoke, the higher your risk for type 2 diabetes. No matter what type of diabetes you have, smoking makes your diabetes harder to control. If you have diabetes and you smoke, you are more likely to have serious health problems from diabetes. Smokers with diabetes have higher risks for serious complications, including:       Heart and kidney disease            Poor blood flow in the legs and feet that can lead to infections, ulcers, and possible amputation (removal of a body part by surgery, such as toes or feet)         Retinopathy (an eye disease that can cause blindness)           Peripheral neuropathy (damaged nerves to the arms and legs that causes numbness, pain, weakness, and poor coordination)         If you are a smoker with diabetes, quitting smoking will benefit your health right away. People with diabetes who quit have better control of their blood sugar levels.
What the Fluffies say--"awwww..Sorry about your relapse..get back on track and start again"  "Never quit the quit"   "Life is tough yes..but you can do this"  "Get back on the horse and do it again"  "You've got this, YAY!!!"    What the Toughies say--"Be truthful with  yourself"  "Everything you are saying is BS"  "where was your SOS????"  "you need to take your quit seriously as if your life depends on it!!!"  "stop with the excuses!!"  "you think I'm being too hard on you?  Well try getting cancer!", "easy peasy!!!"        The truth is...on a successful quit board....we need BOTH types of support.  That's why it works here.  They compliment each other.  They are both vital.       Sometimes you need a gentle hand,  sometimes you need a swift kick in the butt and to be called out on your s**t...and sometimes you need both at the same time.        But...I believe..despite our different styles of support...we agree on more than we disagree, that is for sure.     One word we all use frequently...no matter what type of support we dish out....is  NOPE!!       I think we also agree...that everyone can quit smoking.         What else do you think we all agree on when it comes to quitting smoking?

    I think we all agree that bakon was dropped on his head as a baby...…   I also think we agree on how nice it is not to stink of stale smoke...…..
    We all think we miss some of the oldies around here...  We also agree this addiction kills more people than all the wars together....you need to fight for your quit ....
    I think we all agree that smoking sucks.    -and    I think we all agree the chicks can't count.
    I think we can all agree that anybody can quit smoking because we are proof !   Quitting smoking is ultimately DO-ABLE no matter who you are.   All it takes is a commitment to never taking another puff again...ever.     I hope we all agree that honesty, truth and integrity concerning our quits is essential.    We no longer believe the addict's lies and must be rigorous in revealing them to protect our quits.         We likely agree that the sticks Cheat.  Always have.     
I have to admit I am a fluffy.  You probably figured that out right away.  I can't accept anyone being a lost cause (except maybe bakon. He is either a bad boy or a dirty old man lol).I think you need all the personalities combined together for the forum to work.  Sometimes it just takes the right person clicking with another person for things to work.   I have great love and respect for you all because you have helped me save my life.

@Linda Thomas you are most definitely a toughie! (A tough lady that is) I love watching you quit! A true inspiration          You can't quit and smoke at the same time. It's one or the other. (And one=all)     The only true way to quit smoking is to stop putting the dang things in your mouth and then Never! Take! Another! Puff!     Education on nicotine addiction builds a firm quit foundation.     
    I think I am a Fluffy... dunno figure you catch more flies with honey than vinegar... doesn't mean I don't care when someone looses their quit... just .. oh I dunno... maybe its the big sister in my, I just want to do the gently, gently... I always try to find something positive... ironically if I was to SOS personally the foot up the arse, tough love approach would achieve more in keeping me quit than the hand holding approach. 
    Thankfully ...I didn't have a relape here....I knew I had far too much to lose....but if I had ...I would have expected  tough tough love ...   I knew the Quit Train Peeps were watching my back ...No matter what was said ...
I will take fluffy, toughie and everything in-between.      I have learnt in the last 24 hours it's hard to quit alone.         Sometimes you don't appreciate your quit family until they're not there.
    I wish booger Linda thomass and jiller (which I think is slang for what women do when they "double click the mouse") weren't here.      Then again glad they are. Like hanging out with people so dumb I look smart.
    I don't really subscribe to fluff or tough.  Just the facts will suffice.       Quitting is simple.  Smoking offers nothing positive.  Every "reason" to smoke is just an excuse to get a nicotine fix.     Keep it simple folks.  There's no point in making straight lines crooked.    
    Its all a matter of nope!

I am 26 days in and I'm feeling weird..... off..... like something's not right. My craves are few and mild, yet I have a sense of something is just not quiet right. I don't feel like a non smoker, but more like a smoker who is trying to quit smoking. I repeat it to myself that I don't smoke and I am a non smoker, and I can honestly say that I am not too worried about slipping, at least not right now. I do think about cigarettes a lot, not really about smoking them or reminiscing about them..... not really thinking anything in particular about them, just thinking about them. Like my brain is constantly on alert, even when I'm not craving or stressed or agitated. I feel I have this big red flashing no smoking sign deep in my brain.... and its constantly there, constantly flashing... no matter what I'm thinking about.... kids, work, vacation, sex, food, scented or unscented hair spray ... doesn't matter..... there is always the big red flashy no smoking sign in the background somewhere. Did anyone else experience the feeling of something being off??? I didn't post an S.O.S. or anything because I really don't feel my quit is in jeopardy.... I have no desire to smoke at the moment, I just feel blah.
    Yes, those feelings are all normal and so frustrating! I had them as did many of us. Just power through and one day very soon you will wake up and smoking will not be constantly on your mind, I promise you 
    Yes verrrrry normal. For me it was a weird something is missing feeling! I should be doing something! Something I always did and still do on the rare occasion...is say to myself don't let a thought turn into a crave. And just bat away any thoughts of smoking. You are doing a grand job btw, keep up the good work

I repeat it to myself that I don't smoke and I am a non smoker, and I can honestly say that I am not too worried about slipping, at least not right now.             That was the last hurdle I cleared in my quit.  It was about eight or nine months in before I really started feeling like a nonsmoker who was permanently done with the cigarettes.  It wasn't a huge issue.  I wasn't struggling with my quit.  There was just a mental block there.  Eventually I was able to flip that switch, but it took some time.        Years of addiction and conditioning can take some time to undo.
    Like the others have said, I think we all go through that "something's not right" feeling for some period of time. Smoking was tied to everything in our lives and suddenly, it's not! That's a huge change in almost everything we do and feel throughout each day. As for that Red NO SMOKING Warning Sign flashing in the background, I think that's pretty normal too. I know I had to really focus on being a non-smoker for probably the best part of my first year. It didn't seem natural to me and I wasn't yet comfortable with the fact that I was a non-smoker. Now, it's second nature to me and I even have trouble seeing myself as a used-to-be smoker

This might be your time to fake it til you make it! Keep up the positive self talk and just find something else to do!  Congratulations on your almost month free!
    Yeah, it feels weird, smoking used to be always there and suddenly it’s gone. And then all the weird bodily adjustments. But one day not-smoking will become the new normal and your body better than ever. Keep on going, you’re doing great!

I am 13 months into the quit and sometimes, like once a week, I just get this weird impulse like "time to smoke". Believe me I have thought about "Well I am doing good, just one won't hurt."  But yeah, things can feel "off".        The only advice I can offer is keep temptation at bay best you can.     The good part of quitting is our health improves, some things immediately and some things over several weeks or months. The shit part though is we end up having to pay some mental dues, in the form of cravings.

My craves are few and mild, yet I have a sense of something is just not quiet right. I don't feel like a non smoker, but more like a smoker who is trying to quit smoking. I repeat it to myself that I don't smoke and I am a non smoker, and I can honestly say that I am not too worried about slipping, at least not right now. I do think about cigarettes a lot, not really about smoking them or reminiscing about them..... not really thinking anything in particular about them, just thinking about them. Like my brain is constantly on alert, even when I'm not craving or stressed or agitated. I feel I have this big red flashing no smoking sign deep in my brain.... and its constantly there, constantly flashing... no matter what I'm thinking about.... kids, work, vacation, sex, food, scented or unscented hair spray ... doesn't matter..... there is always the big red flashy no smoking sign in the background somewhere. Did anyone else experience the feeling of something being off??? I didn't post an S.O.S. or anything because I really don't feel my quit is in jeopardy.... I have no desire to smoke at the moment, I just feel blah.               One month into your quit is not a long time.    Please be kind to yourself, nurture yourself and reward yourself !  The receptors in your brain are being re-fitted one by one with each thought you have that isn't accompanied with a blast of nicotine.  This takes time and I was really fed up with thinking smokey thoughts.  I wasn't going to smoke, I was just weary of fighting the thoughts about not smoking...the issue of addiction etc... etc...etc...       You can start replacing smokey thoughts with other thoughts.    I had to make it simple.    I started to replace smokey thoughts with a visual prompt of beauty,    like 'that light on that leaf or, that shadow from my hand, that beautiful cloud'....   I also used aural prompts by putting on a favorite song.        Be sure to reward yourself in some way when you replace a thought.  This helps getting your receptors back, working for your rewards.   I guess, my reward was finding something pretty to look at or listen to but, slowly opening a Satsuma was a sensory reward too.      Edited November 8, 2018 by Sazerac

    What you are doing with all that money ,you have saved since you quit....   Does anyone want to take me to dinner ????  You must be loaded ...
    I just turned in my reward chips with my husband.  I am getting new family room carpeting and this new waterproof laminate plank (that looks like wood) for my kitchen. We have needed it replaced for quite a while.  How quickly the money adds up when you quit.  In a few more months, I'll be able to redo the bathroom.

    Yup. It happened. I told myself I wouldn't let it happen, and now here I sit. Traded one addiction for another. I mean full blown, raging mad winter green Lifesaver addiction. I've eaten sooooooooo many. And I want to eat soooooooo many more. And I really don't care if too much is not good for me... Imma eat them until my bathroom smells like a candy cane factory when I'm done using it. Hi my name is Mary and I am a mintaholic.
    Hey Mary,       Having your bathroom smell like a candy cane is actually not that bad an idea...but yes too much of anything is not good enough I suppose.   
    I was a soft peppermint puffs addict for a good solid year lol
    Spearmint Lifesavers were mine with water, driving had to have blowpop or a tootsie pop
    Don't nudge into my Altoids supply, or my Lemon Head supply, or my stash of Satsumas !  I am still possessive about them, lol.
    So of course no cigarettes for a month now, that is awesome.        But the bathroom, will it be like this -    Someone walks in and says, "WOW, this restroom smells so minty fresh!"  Someone else goes - "Oh yeah, it always does after Mary drops her morning deuce".   And then people walk in going "ooohhhhh" and "aaaahhhh".        I know when i use the restroom people think it is a Sunday Service because the fragrance makes people blurt out, "Jesus Christ!"    Well umm anyways...     I am not a fan of wintergreen lifesavers. people either love them or hate them. Or somewhere in between.    You can have my supply.  
I was sitting thinking today, that over the last year I have had two relapses, and this is my 3rd attempt in a year to quit, now I am seriously beginning to realise that way back last year I would not have even attempted to quit if it had not been for finding, joining and taking part in this Forum, being able to see that I am not alone, that there are different ways to quit, that not everyone's quit is the same, that it doesnt matter if you relapse the support is here to help you re- quit, seeing so many quitters who have been committed to keeping the quit, helping others that are struggling, offering support and advice its amazing, being part of this forum has certainly prompted me to keep on and get to my sticky quit.  Outside of the forum we have our Doctors, leaflets, internet advice, not quite the 24/7 help and support we all need, and the beauty of it is, all it takes is the touch of a button and we can interact with someone, talk out our quit, socialise, laugh, share things and connect.  Pretty amazing isn't it.  I can honestly say that if I hadn't stumbled across my little family in the corner of the internet my relapse last year would still be my relapse now, it was the thought of everyone here, that pushed me that little bit harder to come back and to try again.  So glad I did.  Quitting smoking is one of the most amazing things that you can do, one of the others is joining this forum.  Quitting is no longer a scary and lonely trip but more of an adventure with people who care and support, leading you to live a better, healthier stronger and more fulfilling life.
that's awesome Jackie! I couldn't agree more....I am a firm believer in support and what that does to and for a person. Once you are on the Quit Train...even if one relapses it's difficult to go back to "mindless smoking" -- You are educated about nicotine addiction and once you know the truth......it's hard to stick your head back in the sand. Bravo you! and congratulations on 6 days smober! :)
Nicely said Jackie. I really appreciate everything this forum has done for me. This time around, I know my quit is my sticky/forever quit. Thanks to the QT, I've had a great support system throughout my quit, which has helped me stay focused and committed to NOPE.  I'm extremely proud of you Jackie and know you have struggled; I applaud you for not giving up, regardless of what happens. That shows me how serious you are about quitting. 
A brilliant and honest post jackie....Being apart of this forum gives you all the support ,to get you to reach your destination....After countless of trying to quit and failing....It took this journey with this group of folks to keep me focused....This will be your sticky..... Well done sweetheart....
that it doesnt matter if you relapse the support is here to help you re- quitWhile it is essential to help those who relapse, this is a very dangerous thought. I would also like to add that even with how little time I usually spend here, I see many folks relapsing without saying a word (let alone posting an SOS). Obviously the board can only help you, if you use it.
I remember posting a SOS, on another board when I was really thinking of saying fck it again, and smoke. But, I thought I would try the the SOS first, to see if it would help. The "helpful" responses poured in, immediately. The only one that sticks in my mind now, was the one that replied (if I remember it correctly),  "No, you don't", (feel like smoking). I was a little hurt at that one. I also remember posting a short time later, that my strong urge to smoke had dissipated, before I had finished writing the SOS. Then, I knew he was right. My membership of that board and willingness, to do what was suggested in it, had "saved the day".
I think it's a superbly powerful quit tool to have people who would will you on. Also the information is invaluable. As Babs said, an educated relapse is always going to be a problem...well done you for not re submerging your head in the sand and coming back.  To (kinda) quote Markus he said to guard the quit. That it was the vigilant quit that survived, nothing to do with who was stronger. To (kinda) quote Bakon, NOPE! Can't argue nope, nothing there to argue with, it's a strong statement and one that brooks no disagreement. It's sayings like this and the video's MQ posts and Joels words that we wouldn't get from another place. Smoking cessation clinics are one persons voice, alone it is not entirely believable for some. For me Jac I'm so pleased you're back! No more doubts chicky, hold fast and know "this too will pass" cause it's true, everything, every feeling good or bad passes.  x
When I quit I just decided one evening and smoked my last.  The next morning I was smoke free and started searching the internet for help.  I'm a firm believer that a group of people going through the same thing is better than any other help so I was searching for a forum of people stopping smoking.  I found the QT and was busy reading, reading and reading some more.  It was such a help to realize that each step of the way was "normal".  Some people reach stages faster than others and it was nice to see that it was OK if you were earlier or later than other people.  Jackie, I feel this is your sticky quit! 
I find it helpful that there are friendly people reaching for the same goal, all ex-smokers so can see from your perspective. I find the scare tatics of heath service all quite ineffective and patronising. 
I found it encouraging when people reached back to me - and assured me that what I was feeling was normal, and would resolve itself. I find it serves to remind me when I reach back to people. Accountability - I did not want to let my friends down. I did not want to feel that I had weakened another's quit by quitting my quit. and...I'm scared of my Quit Buddy

This is why I think it's important too....I agree with stu and marti...You know your going to feel like you have let down the folks who are supporting you 100 per cent...This helped me so much in my early days.....telling my quit friends I have smoked and hear thier disappointment...No....I carnt do that.....so I carry on.....it worked......for me.....
    Bumping this ...    Please add ...why this fabulous place works .for you ....
I lurked for ten or so months here and on QSMB, educating myself on nicotine addiction  and learning how different people handle their quit.        I realized that I wasn't 'more addicted' than anyone else   and saw how some struggled more, some less. I recognized that it was up to me how difficult I was going to make my quit.    All the Elders kept saying, It Will Get Better and Better.  They didn't lie.        Not being a 'joiner' or one for 'groups',   I initially joined to thank the people that had blazed a trail for me   and then understood that I could pay back the gift that was given to me.        But, it is not pure altruism that keeps me here.    It is the camaraderie, the power of community and being held accountable that helps me stay honest with myself/my quit. When I see responses to an SOS or when someone is in trouble or hurting in some way,    the outpouring of concern and care and useful information makes my heart so glad    and I have been comforted and supported many times through the years.   We are family.      Thank y'all,    new quitters and those with years of a successful quit, ALL of you make my world a better place.        SEdited November 12, 2018 by Sazerac
I'm in a better place now to answer this question.. It's simple...This place saved me from a very uncertain future...   After smoking 52 years...I had run out of chances...to quit...this HAD to be my last chance...  Myself and my two feet were about to part company...    I had that many failed attempts ...it's impossible to count...  Searching through the internet I stumbling onto the most wonderful people.. Who never gave up encouraging me...day by day...I was actually quitting..   I was making friends..some that will be with me forever..whether they are still here or not...  I've learnt computer stuff...just enough to get me by...and post a picture or two ( sorry Babs )... At the beginning it might have all been in vain...  But !!! ..Thankfully ..up till today..My feet and I are still together...   So what does this place mean to me ....EVERYTHING.....

That is it.  Why I could not quit before.  I remember the doctor, at the smoking cessation clinic not even looking me in eyes and just handing me the information on smoking.  I felt as if she looked down on me.  I walked out of there feeling the same as I walked in.  I came across this forum, while looking for ways to quit on the internet.  I lurked for about a week.   I finally joined and was able to quit, cold turkey.     There is so much care and support here.  They may be scattered throughout the globe but it is as if they reach through your computer,  take your hand and lead you through this difficult journey.   They understand the battle,  the emotions, the self loathing and the grip this awful addiction has on you.     It is true that you begin to care about these people and you don't want to let them down.   I also found that helping to support others made me want to keep my quit.
My doctor told me I had ten to twelve years left to live if I didn't quit. The junkie in me was thinking ' ok, that's 62, around the same age my dad died' But then his comment made me mad and I set out to prove to him he was wrong and I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.    So I kept googling my quit symptoms and the searches always led me to my old forum. I too had never been a part of a forum so I lurked for about three weeks. Then one day while there I saw first-hand an SOS and how everyone came running to get that member past it. It worked, they got past it and I signed up right then and there.  I truly believe I would not have quit without the forum and the people who I have come to care about like family.   Plus too was the fact that I had my quit buddies who I couldn't let down
Oh, Jillar, I found that same forum about 2 months after I quit due to having what is known as a CVA while at work..(cardio vascular incident)......a stroke!!! Due to family history of cardiovascular problems, my smoking was leading me to an early death, for sure! I smoked for 40+ years!  It was now or never in terms of quitting....which I did with the help of the hospital staff providing the patch that first week! Finding that QSMB forum two months later was the best thing ever.....I was able to finally educate myself about my addiction by reading and watching Joel's videos. It was very upsetting when that forum shut down....I wish I had some way to find some of those who befriended me there....although some are here such as you...and a few others like Beazel and Lin-Quitting are here but not as active anymore. Glad to have made some new friends here.....
    Whether or not there exists a thing like No Man's Land.. I am definitely in it.     This thread got me thinking. And.... well, a bit embarassed to ask but... ... i thought... maybe I need a quit buddy who I can reach outside this forum, like via whatsapp. Just to silently scream once in a while, or to reach out when I need to. Ofcourse I'd be there to return the favour. Please PM me if you are interested in exchanging quit sitter services.      
    You shouldn't be embarrassed to ask that at all MLMR. A lot of us have or had quit buddies our first year quit. I had several and since I don't have a smartphone I was at least able to text my quit buddy if I was away from home and internet. Quit buddies work and I highly recommend them 
    I do not whatsapp but I sent my email to you

When it comes around next year ..you will be much stronger..and have had your Lido Party...and us old Phartes love a party...   So we need you all to make sure you get there...
    During the first year there are a plethora of 'seasonal' triggers.  Autumn/Winter may include family 'togetherness' which is sometimes not very 'together'  and triggers an urge to smoke.  These emotional responses are normal. Some of our families are a piece of work, for sure.   Keep in mind H A  L T.  Are you Hungry- Angry (emotional)-Lonesome (bored, fed-up lol)-Tired-Stressed out ? Do you just need a break ?  Step outside and take a few clear clean breaths.    Center yourself.    Congratulate yourself on quitting smoking.  Give yourself a reward for keeping it together.     You quit smoking !  Celebrate your freedom every day.

https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/smoking-cessation-news-628/the-sooner-you-quit-smoking-the-better-739252.html       "These findings underscore the benefits of quitting smoking within five years, which is a 38 percent lower risk of a heart attack, stroke or other forms of cardiovascular disease," said study author Meredith Duncan, from Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. "The bottom line is if you smoke, now is a very good time to quit," Duncan said in an American Heart Association news release.  Her team also found that it takes more than 15 years from the time you quit until your cardiovascular disease risk returns to the level of those who never smoked -- so the sooner you quit, the better.    Cigarette smoking in America is declining and leaving a growing population of former smokers. Earlier studies have hinted that the risk for heart disease lessens within a few years after quitting, but these studies haven't looked closely at smoking history, including changes in smoking habits.  In this study, Duncan and her colleagues analyzed data on the lifetime smoking histories of nearly 8,700 people who took part in the Framingham Heart Study.    At the beginning of the study, none of the participants suffered from cardiovascular disease. Over 27 years, researchers compared the risk for heart disease among people who never smoked with those who quit. They found that more than 70 percent of heart disease occurred in current or former smokers who smoked at least 20 pack-years -- smoking one pack a day for 20 years.   But smokers who quit within the last five years cut their risk for cardiovascular disease by 38 percent, compared with people who continued to smoke. Moreover, it took 16 years after quitting for the risk of cardiovascular disease to return to the level of never smokers, the researchers found.  The findings are to be presented Sunday at the American Heart Association's annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6360637/It-takes-smokers-hearts-15-years-recover-quitting.html
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/health/fda-menthol-cigarettes-ban.html               F.D.A. Plans to Seek a Ban on Menthol Cigarettes    Image   As part of its campaign against flavored e-cigarettes and nicotine addiction, the Food and Drug Administration plans to seek a ban on sales of menthol cigarettes. It’s a measure long sought by health advocates, who said the products were marketed heavily to African-Americans.CreditCreditJeff Chiu/Associated Press  By Sheila Kaplan    Nov. 9, 2018    In a landmark move bound to further shake the tobacco industry, the Food and Drug Administration plans to propose a ban on menthol cigarettes next week as part of its aggressive campaign against flavored e-cigarettes and some tobacco products, agency officials said.  The proposal would have to go through the F.D.A. regulatory maze, and it could be several years before such a restriction took effect, especially if the major tobacco companies contest the agency’s authority to do so. None of the major tobacco companies would comment on the possibility of barring menthol cigarettes at this early stage.   But such a move has been long-awaited by public health advocates, who have been especially concerned about the high percentage of African-Americans who become addicted to menthol cigarettes.  Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the agency’s commissioner, would not comment publicly on the proposal on Friday. But in a recent interview, he said the F.D.A. was revisiting the issue, one that had been weighed in previous administrations. “It was a mistake for the agency to back away on menthol,” he said earlier this fall.   Canada has already imposed a ban on menthol cigarettes, and the European Union’s ban is set to go into effect in 2020. Earlier this year, San Francisco passed a prohibition against the sales of menthol cigarettes and flavored e-cigarettes. The menthol proposal is just one of several initiatives the F.D.A. plans to announce sometime next week, including a ban on sales of most flavored e-cigarettes, except menthol and mint, at retail stores and gas stations across the country. The products, which include such flavors as chicken-and-waffles and mango, would be mainly relegated to sales online, at sites where the agency hopes to impose strict age verification to ensure that minors could not buy them.   As e-cigarettes became a booming business and extremely popular among teenagers and young people, health officials, parents and others became alarmed at the soaring use of nicotine-addicting products that were considered alternatives to traditional smoking for adults.    The F.D.A. began targeting the major manufacturers of e-cigarettes, focusing in particular on Juul Labs, the maker of a popular, flashy product that has become nearly ubiquitous in schools and on the streets.    Just a day after agency officials began issuing details of next week’s plan to ban some sales, Juul Labs indicated on Friday that it had decided to pull several of its wildly popular flavored e-cigarette pods off store shelves, according to several people briefed by the company. Editors’ Picks  What I Learned from Watching My iPad’s Slow Death   The Bright Future and Grim Death of a Privileged Hollywood Daughter China’s Women-Only Subway Cars, Where Men Rush In   The vaping giant will continue to sell its liquid nicotine pods in mint, menthol and tobacco flavors in brick-and-mortar stores, but will restrict other flavors that could be appealing to younger people to online sales. Juul Labs launched the device, which resembles a flash drive, in 2015, and now has about 77 percent of the United States e-cigarette market.    Last month, a competitor, Altria, said it would discontinue most of its flavored e-cigarettes and support federal legislation to raise the age of purchase to 21 for any tobacco and vaping product.    Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, had been an advocate of such restrictions. “While more must be achieved to fully regulate e-cigs like actual cigarettes, Juul’s effort is a good step in snuffing out kid-friendly flavors that have fueled the spiking nicotine addiction amongst America’s youth and can make a difference,” Mr. Schumer said in an email.   Lisa David, president and chief executive of Public Health Solutions, a New York-based nonprofit group specializing in health issues for low-income and immigrant families, said she opposed keeping mint and menthol flavors easily available in stores, especially given the gateway effect for young people who start vaping and then move to traditional cigarettes.    “Menthol makes it seem less harsh, and also makes the body absorb more nicotine,” she said. “That means it’s easier to start smoking and harder to quit.”   Ms. David also wondered if Juul's restriction might be too late, because of the many similar devices, called “Juul-alikes,” already on the market.  Sign up for Science Times   We’ll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.  “Juul clearly was a contributor to the really significant uptake of young people using e-cigarettes,” Ms. David said. “At this point there are a bunch of other versions of the ‘Juul-alikes.’ They have similar shapes and flavors and are appealing to the same audience.”    The battle against menthol cigarettes has continued for decades.    According to the N.A.A.C.P.’s Youth Against Menthol campaign, about 85 percent of African-American smokers aged 12 and up smoke menthol cigarettes, compared with 29 percent of white smokers, which the organization calls a result of decades of culturally tailored tobacco company promotion.   The most popular menthol brand in the United States is Newport, which is the second-largest-selling cigarette brand in the industry, according to the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Imperial Brands has two strong sellers, Kool and Salem. Altria’s best-selling cigarette, Marlboro, is also available in menthol, as is R.J.R.’s Camel.    A spokesman for R. J. Reynolds declined to comment. Altria and Imperial Brands could not be immediately reached.    In a joint statement on Friday, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Lung Association and several other public health groups said that action on menthol cigarettes was long overdue.   “There is overwhelming scientific evidence that menthol cigarettes have had a profound adverse effect on public health in the United States, resulting in more death and disease,” the organizations said.  Although federal health officials released new reports this week that indicated traditional smoking had reached a record low since 1965, smoking-related deaths still number about 480,000 in the United States every year.
Probably just a NOPE NOPE and a lot of you don't want that! ha! I am going to be around a lot of smokers on Saturday for a friend's 25th wedding anniversary party. I have drank and been around smokers but this is much more of a smoking crowd.  I WILL stay strong. I can breathe easy and can RUN! Guess i am just looking for more motivation. Outings like this still scare me :/

Here's my advice...don't be afraid! 1.  Look at it like a learning experience.  Watch them...watch how they get fidgety when they aren't smoking.  You will be fine during those moments because you aren't a smoker. Now that          is freedom!!    2.  Notice how they stink--YUK!!!   3.  Don't try to avoid them...if they all go out to smoke, don't be afraid to go with them.  It's not the smoking that socializes them....it's the socializing.  Believe me, they will be envious of you        for being so strong.    4.  Unless someone seriously wants to talk about how you quit smoking..(send them here) I would avoid talking too much about it.  Just because I feel smokers like to protect themselves            and they aren't ready to hear it.   5.  Dance your butt off!  Because you can   and you won't be huffing and puffing like your friends6.  Smoking isn't even an option for you...so, have a wonderful time and enjoy your first party with the smoking crowd...after that it will be easy peasy whenever you are in their company          again.

This is great news!                  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/08/cdc-says-smoking-rates-fall-to-record-low-in-us.html                           CDC says smoking rates fall to record low in US     An estimated 14 percent of adults, or 34.3 million people, smoked cigarettes in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In 1965, 42.4 percent of adults smoked cigarettes, according to the CDC.    E-cigarette use declined slightly between 2016 and 2017.    Angelica LaVito | @angelicalavito   Published 2 Hours Ago CNBC.com  Pascal Le Segretain | Getty Images  Cigarette smoking has fallen to its lowest point in recorded history, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    An estimated 14 percent of adults in the U.S., or 34.3 million people, smoked cigarettes in 2017, down from 15.5 percent in 2016, according to the CDC. This historic low represents a 67 percent decline from 1965, when the National Health Interview Survey started tracking the figure and 42.4 percent of adults smoked cigarettes.    The new data highlight how successful public health efforts have been over the past few decades. But it also shows that while concentrating on cigarettes has largely paid off, about 47 million people are still using some type of tobacco product.   "The declines we saw in 2017 for adult smoking are certainly unprecedented," said Brian King, a deputy director in the CDC's office on smoking and health, while cautioning against considering the data an overall public health win.  Initiatives like raising the price of tobacco, educating consumers on the dangers of smoking and efforts to help people quit are the primary drivers behind the decline, said King. Fewer young people are starting to smoke, older smokers are dying and others are quitting, he said. When adding other categories, including e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, 16.2 percent of adults, or 47 million people, used tobacco products of some kind in 2017, according to the CDC. Cigars, cigarillos or filtered little cigars were the second-most used product behind cigarettes, with 3.8 percent of adults, or 9.3 million people, saying they used them. Nearly 4 percent of adults use two or more tobacco products, with cigarettes and e-cigarettes representing the most common combination. It's unclear whether people are initially using both as part of the process to switch from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, but officials warn that people must fully switch in order to cut smoking risks.  Juul, the most popular e-cigarette on the market, was created to help smokers switch from cigarettes. While some adults are using the Juul devices to do just that, anecdotal evidence suggests many teens are also using the devices. Preliminary federal data show a 77 percent surge in high school students using e-cigarettes, figures that have prompted the Food and Drug Administration to label this an "epidemic."    The agency ordered five manufacturers — Juul, British American Tobacco's Vuse, Altria's MarkTen, Imperial Brands' Blu E-cigs and Japan Tobacco's Logic — to submit plans within 60 days on reducing teen use. The five companies represent about 97 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to the FDA.    Among adults, 2.8 percent used e-cigarettes last year, according to the CDC, down slightly from 3.2 percent in 2016. King cautions that this survey may not have captured how many adults are using Juul because the trend picked up in the later half of 2017 and the survey was conducted on a monthly basis. He also worries that young adults are using these products more than older demographics even though they're less likely to smoke conventional cigarettes. For adults ages 18 to 24, 5.2 percent used e-cigarettes and 10.4 percent smoked cigarettes last year, according to the CDC.   "If e-cigarette use was responsible [for declines in cigarette use], you would expect to see a perfect correlation, but that's not what we're seeing," he said. "If anything, e-cigarettes have complicated the tobacco product landscape."
Well I have been away for a  little bit, so time for a bit of a story.      Starting with the title and no Memories doesn't refer to the Elaine Paige song. Sorry Cats fans! And it is not even about the way we were.      Although first of all, maybe time to think back. Just how many of the tens or hundreds of thousands of cigarettes over the years were memorable for you? It may be that there are a few, but I bet it was more about the event you associate it with rather than the cigarette itself. I can't think of any myself.     Three months into my quit, when it wasn't really completely solid, I made the decision to commit my money to a charity trek in The Grand Canyon and Zion National Park. Having just got back from it, I can tell you now it was the best decision I ever made. I've been a lot more open to jumping in and attending events with others since I quit and it led on to this trek. What a time!       After the memorable journey for all the wrong reasons, 27 hours travelling is less than fun, I met up with 25 great people from a broad spectrum of the company I work at. It was truly the trip of a lifetime. From the moment we started hiking the South Rim of the Canyon, through to the two more challenging hikes the following days, the scenary, the company and the achievement of completing together was like nothing I had ever experienced. If anything Zion National Park was even more incredible. All of this because I chose to invest my £10 a day elsewhere. Saz speaks passionately about the value of rewards and having completed this it is something I really get. There's a natural high that no substance can replicate that you get from being out in the sun, with friends, achieving great things in the moment, as well as delivering the sort of sponsorship that will make life defining memories for others less fortunate.       I could bang on about this for hours, but just to keep this simple for now, I know now I gave up nothing and gained everything. You can to, it doesn't all have to be spent on one big event, that's just what worked for me. Make sure you connect with the world and your true friends. That's the real reward.       A few pictures from the trip for those interested, but just to add the pictures don't do the true beauty of it justice.  https://flic.kr/s/aHsmuSgcq5Edited November 4, 2018 by Sslip
    Glad you had the time of your life  That part of the USA is awe inspiring to be sure. Very unique and the scenery is breathtaking. I recognize a few of the landmarks in your photos from having seen them myself. So, even more proof that quitting smoking and channeling your $$ elsewhere was the best decision you ever made! Congratulations.
    Great stuff, Shane.  I just started looking at the pics but so far, they look awesome.      Quitting smoking really improves your life in ways you never expected.       
    How freaking AWESOME!! Wonderful, beautiful and well deserved, friend! 
Great post Shane, glad you had a good time here  Edited November 5, 2018 by jillar
    I am so proud of you.... you not only rewarded yourself with an amazing experience but you rewarded yourself by giving back to others. All the training and preparation paid of, being smoke free definitely paid off.... and despite giving yourself the trip of a lifetime you did it all for a brilliant bloody charity. So sure you had fun, and you rewarded your quit efforts and savings by having an awesome life experience but you also gave to a charity. I am wrapped the trip was everything you hoped and more. The photos are frickin smashing thank you so much for sharing.
    So proud of you. The trip looks amazing and your commitment and determination are admirable. Great job! 
    So glad you had a great trip Shane. That is such an amazing area to visit. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, and the pictures are great. Good to see you back.
    What a achievement @Sslip.....and a trip of a life time......and for a great cause....I love stories like this...high five !!!  I was angry,this tablet wouldn't let me look at the fabulous pictures...grrrr.....
    So so proud of you my friend, being able to give without expecting anything in return, and enjoying that is a lost art.     You are an amazing person and that resonates in the work you do...the pics are amazing. One can almost feel the happiness and joy through them. Here's to more beautiful memories...
    Absolutely beautiful pics Shane, looks just awesome there, what a fantastic experience. So glad you had a great time.   Thanks for sharing with us.

    Thank you so much for sharing your trip, Shane. The canyons you visited are magnificent.    You and the whole crew look blissed out.    I remember that feeling visiting there, it was an experience unlike any other   and I was too awestruck to communicate  the feelings I had.
Yesterday was month 13 of quit. I have had NO tobacco nor nicotine, weed, or whatever. Yeah i am afraid if I smoked a doob, it would trigger something even though I have smoked it maybe 10 times or less in my life. The closest I have been to smoking since I quit is when someone is standing outside a store puffing away their lives.        Anyways, so a couple weekends ago my room mate and i were pulling into this restaurant and I got this weird impulse that said, "light up". Well I can't do that without a cig now can I? So just a brief crave that came and went. But then Sunday I was heading to my sister's apartment and then again, that impulse of "light up".       A few nights ago I had this dream that I was able to start again but didn't want more than two or three cigarettes a week. Like I was in control of it. Side note about that - I work with this guy that used to chew and says he has dreams about chewing. F*****g nicotine won't leave ANY addict alone in dreams will it? He quit using it a while back but anyways.     So I am now thinking, just how much longer will I be dealing with this? The craves are not powerful but I want them gone. How the hell can the brain be so addicted to something so bad?
    Sorry that some triggers are still there and I have no advice to offer being a little way behind you. It is stunning that you have a quit that is strong despite these memories and addict prompts, you have already done an amazing job. I hope this is simply the last of the fading memories giving it one last try to get you to celebrate inappropriately.     Keep rocking the quit and showing us how it is done!
^^ What he said....     But your brain still has more smoking memories than quit memories. I know, like me, you have often wondered at those who get through that first year and relapse in month 13, 14, 15.... it probably just like you have experienced... maybe subconsciously we associate the 12 months as the job being done and it gives the addiction a chance to weedle back in... its about being ever vigilant.        I am sorry you have had a rough few days... but compare these passing thoughts that you know for what they are to what you went through in the third month. I am sure they are more frustrating than actually real chances of tossing your quit. You have a few coming behind you who need you to hang on... cos no pressure at all  .... I know your quit is strong, this is a little bump... use it as the reminder that the addiction will always be there weaker and weaker each day, month and year... but every now and then, when we feel all comfy that its a done deal its going to try and hook us back in... that just what being an addict is all about. Knowing that that is what it is gives you the power to laugh in its face and move on....       and because I never get to do one.... WooHoo Happy 13th month smoke free....
    Everyone is different JB...time...and everyone time is different ....   You will still  think of cigarettes ..even I do...but not as a crave ..it's just a thought ..like a million others i have in a day...   Your going great ......as long as you dont turn it into something else ..and smoke ...it's normal..
Good job Jet Black      I am only 19 hours smoke free
    Hey JB! I'm just a little ahead of you in time at a year and a half or so and I still have thoughts, bordering on weak cravings for a smoke here and there. They are fleeting thoughts but they are strong enough still that when they do come, it's surprising and if I was in a weak moment and like you noted, if I actually had a cigarette handy, I might light up just on a whim. That's why we always have to be on our guard and aware that it CAN happen if we were to get careless. We see people coming back here after a year or more quit for this very reason. They dropped their guard just one time and fell for that sinister thought .... Surely I can have just one!     Now just to put this in perspective for those behind us in their quits, these craves or thoughts of smoking are not in the same category as those we experience during our first months or even year of our quit. These thoughts of smoking or suggestions from deep in our mind that we should be lighting up are pretty weak and last only seconds and, they are not coming frequently which is what makes them dangerous. We aren't expecting them and most days we have no thoughts or urges to smoke. They come out of nowhere. I can't even identify a trigger when they come upon me. I will be just going about a normal everyday routine and one just comes into my head from nowhere. It's weird. But I do figure that these too will continue to get more and more infrequent as time goes by. Just like the rest of our quit though, progress is so gradual we don't notice it happening - it just does. That's it folks; time! It all just takes time so our job, once our quits are well established, is just to remain on guard and to be sure we aren't one of those coming back here after a year or so with our tails between our legs and starting this whole process over again.
I'd be 9 years quit on feb 10 if i didn't blow a long quit, its addiction. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction          I still pop around, from here to other groups. Its a demon we all have. Understand that's what it is.. I don't know if you know who Mike piano is but he'd call himself an alcoholic that was sober X years (a long time)...

    Well JB you are right it is getting old and we have to be on guard, and remember focus on what is NEW again!!!!

How the hell can the brain be so addicted to something so bad?                Craves are thoughts.  Nothing more.  They come and go.      We don't act on every thought that we have.  Most of us would be dead or in prison if we did.       Smoking thoughts are no different than the thousands of other thoughts that pass through our mind everyday.  They are only an issue if you act on them.     Don't fear random thoughts.
Hey Jet,    We don’t smoke. That’s the end of that.      13 months is amazing.      Personally I don’t think thoughts of smoking ever go away. We just get used to them and how to deal with them in our own way.  Addiction is addiction.  Not sure if I’ve ever mentioned this but I went through a stent in my early to mid 20s with hard drugs and I still think about it around this time of year. I’m 53. Cigarettes do nothing for us. They take away our time, our money and our health.
    Sometimes I think we have to quit each association separately.      You probably got it worked out that you don't smoke while driving or eating or working and everything is just fine until you, say, enroll in a college class and are walking on campus and that craving hits because you always smoked while in college and...your now in college.          Spend enough time on the campus NOT smoking and the cravings will go away right up until you are studying late at night and you always smoked when you study late at night so....       Anyhow, we have to work through these associations by dissociating smoking with what we previously did smoking.  That or do completely different things as non smokers.  Its a pain but we get well practiced ignoring cravings.  The occasional momentary discomfort beats being on a ventilator.                       
Remember, remember the 5th of November  The Gunpowder treason and plot, I can see of no reason  Why the Gunpowder Treason   Should ever be forgot.          Bonfire night... is the perfect time to hold a Quit Train bonfire... so let me start it off with my 8,783 cigarettes that I have not smoked... burn little coffin nails, burn!

I don't envy you Foe as those first days are not something I think back fondly on but, as you know. you gotta go through those to get to the more manageable days. Congrats on finishing day 1!

    Good job Foe, have a good sleep 
Congrats on making it through Day 1, Foe.  Just take it one day at a time and you can do it.
    One day at time, one day at a time Foe.  Great job on the first day -- keep it going~!!!
    High five first day done!! Don't make yourself crazy if you can't sleep well...use your distractions and sleep when you can.    See you tomorrow!!
    To help you along your journey ,you need to make sure your toolbox is full of tools here are some tools.    Allen Carr the Easy book..this book has helped millions...  Deep breathing excersises   Regula's chewing gum    I had my I pod...sang my head off....   My punching pillow....  Boiled sweets.  Joel's video,s....  More idea ,s quit train...what,s in your toolbox ...
    They need a plan in that tool box, exercise... A dumbbell , deep breathing... I needed that mechanical crutch and cut a straw. Watching videos on youtube about cigg smoking also helped... Here is a pic of a starter kit   
I'll share the tools I use/d :   app to track days not smoked and money saved - still usepharmacy weekly support - used for around 3 weekspatches and lozenges - used for 3 weeksstop smoking forum - still usefriends, I get support and encouragement from both my smoking and non smoking pals - still use (pals are great huh)   exercise, sleep and food for sure got me through my quit. I had lots of early nights early in my quit.         Reading, reading and then reading some more about quitting, the benefits of quitting etc really drum it into your head.         I dinny avoid booze so was still able to enjoy myself while quitting. I know that's a bone of contention for some folk here but it worked well for me. On that note I think it's time for a whisky          I didn't read Allen Carr this time round but I still retain some of it from a previous quit so defo worth a read if you haven't already. Or a re read.

A ﻿dumbbell﻿ ﻿  and how are they supposed to fit you in the box?! (I kid, I kid)        Seriously tho, chocolate and positive self talk...change your mindset from  quitting, to "I'm WINNING!!"    Get over hype words too...it gives it too much power. Cravings, triggers, nicodemon...it's just memories from nicotine receptors.   That leads to educate yourself!! A good educated quit doesn't just fall in your lap; you have to look for it. Google everything. I started with "how nicotine changes my mind and body" and went from there.    Reward yourself daily...kiss your spouse longer, hug your kids tighter...feel good about taking your life back!!

    I was on the forum everyday, practically all day! Supporting others and reading posts really helped me keep my mind off my misery.  Playing games and socializing also helped tons  My JAC (jillars air cigarette). Used it for months and loved looking like an idiot smoking an invisible cigarette   Lots of candy and candy. And then some more candy

    There was the guy that said he would bark/growl...I took from that and would make this crazy guttural bellowing sound to "pump myself up" before I would go into a store or where ever...because as a smoker with "aniexty" (<--I learned this was a nicotine lie as well)  I would "need" to smoke before I went inside anywhere.

I'm a newbie and I loved the quit tool box idea when it was mentioned. It is full to the brim.      Sweets of every variety ie soft caramel toffees (these are amazing), mints, chocolate (I mean like 30 bars), parma violets, liquorice, foamy bananas and rice krispie squares       Puzzle books        Stress balls (I'm surprised they haven't burst yet)     A copy of Oasis song stop crying your heart out (I play this when I feel down and it makes me feel worst )      A notebook to write all my thoughts in      3000 bags of Marmite crisps (it's a big box)        Tissues and my bottle of aromatherapy oil       A ball of wool and needles (not used yet as can't knit)     A jigsaw puzzle         Relaxation CD       My empty charm bracelet                              Edited November 3, 2018 by LillySpelling

Two birds with...              I became obsessive about health and fitness after I quit.  It helped on several fronts.     Between working out and reading books and articles about exercise and nutrition, it didn't leave much time to think about wanting a cigarette.      My tendency towards becoming a hyper-focused geek when I take up something new actually played in my favor on this one.
So people.... we all know quitting can be hard... but it can be fun too... you get to meet new people, you get to laugh at sticks, you get to discover hiding internet research skills.... so regardless of if you are 1 day, 1 month, 1 year or 10 years (or more) quit there has to be at least one funny moment from your quit that even now when you think about it you laugh... it may be something someone posted.... it may be the way you responded to a crave and how silly it was in hindsight.... me I have a million to choose from, this Quit is littered with fun, funny and happy memories.... sure there is some yuck in there... but why waste energy focusing on the bad stuff lets shine a light on the good....     Its so hard to choose... there was the time I had a break down and stomped around the house ranting and raving about 1% and not statistic telling me I wont be successful.. when I typed that post I was so angry I am sure I sprained the tips of my fingers I was thumping the words out so hard. Now hysterical, wish someone had of video taped the crazy woman.... at the time nope.... but I am surprised the people in my house didn't call the folks with the straight jackets.... hahahaha... so funny now.        Then there was the time I sat at the door rocking back and forth because I really wanted a coffee and I couldn't have one because I had to have nil by mouth for a medical test and Junky me was claiming smokes were nil by mouth so they were acceptable.... all night long.... now, at 11 months quit... that's funny... at the time, NOPE... it was a really close call.        Or there are hours of answer a question with a question where I had tears running down my face... explaining my Pineapple experiment to Barry.... and seriously Who is Shane????? so many laughs....        Oh there are the hours of comedians I watched on youtube.... hours of them...best crave beater was laughter...
Hard to chose for me too. I think one of the funniest moments when I was in my first year was the Humor thread that @Hope2Nope talked about not long ago. We somehow started talking about gas and I was telling everyone my hubbys theory of what makes a stinky fart. Awww, good times lol.   Unfortunately that was one thread I was unable to bring over Another funny one by far is the ask a stupid question thread, some of those answers brought tears to my eyes!Great post jo
    Aye the night we were posting all the pineapple pictures in ask a question I was in stitches!! 
    Did Barry ever work out who Shane was?       
    I remember the fart conversation jillar let me think while I get the kids ready for school...       Thanks Jo
    I have to say watching the new stick of the day each day to see just what it would be was often pretty funny.... and then it blew up with the funniest sticks and comments ever.... I have one word for you all.... MEGADONG...... hahahahahaha

MEGADONG......﻿﻿   God, @Doreensfree never ending garden good times in stick alley...  (Don't go there much anymore tho, got weird, stickless and making fun of obese people which is not my bag at. all.)     My personal funny is when I first quit and my husband made a big deal about quitting too, but he "needed" nicorette to use at work. Well, he kept leaving his pack of cigarettes in his pants or on the headboard and it just wore me out that he thought he could keep up this charade.    One day, I had to use his truck (he keeps his stash in the door panel) and there was like 3 packs in there...like 4 in one pack, 10 in another and a full one...and quite coincidentally a FULL unopened nicorette package. I dumped all the cigarettes in the console and put sections of the gum in each empty cigarette pack and put them back in the door panel.    Well, he finally "had to run to the store"...you guys know the drill...when he came home, he was chomping gums and pissy. Oh, man I loved it.   The whole day he stomped and slammed and bit*hed...finally I asked him "Did you even look in the console?"  I'd never seen him move that fast!  Never found another pack of cigarettes in the house again tho!!
    And, you would think he would learn from putting them in the door panel, but nooooo...one night we were on the porch, having a couple of drinks, enjoying the coolness of the on-coming rain when it came a bad storm; hail, lightning, the works.  So, being hill billys, we just moved the party into the truck so we could listen to some music and still enjoy the rain.    This guy leaves his door open during the storm and we're a little buzzed so didn't think anything of it.    The next morning he brings in a mostly full pack that's disintegrating from the flooded door panel  I just laughed and told him "That's your sign!" He quit that day and from what I know hasn't had one since.

    I bought myself a First Class ticket on the Quit Train and am looking forward to the ride.      It's taken me longer than I expected to board but took Jillars advice and waited until I was really ready.      So here I am and I'm feeling really positive and happy that I no longer smoke

Nice of you both to check on me.        Love that picture Jane.     I'm fighting my way through and only 3.5 hours away from completing the first day. It helped that I have had to sort my car out today. It meant a lot of time sitting around in the garage but every time the door opened and I felt the cold I was glad I wasn't having to go out there every half an hour to get my fix.      I don't have any energy which is a bit annoying but might hide out in bed tonight.
    Congratulations on your fast approaching end of day one Lilly.
    Thanks Joe. I'm celebrating by attempting to make cheese straws. I'm soooo rock and roll

    One of the things that got me through the first couple of weeks was getting even.  The tobacco companies take from you - your money, your time, your time on Earth, your natural scent, your clean fingers and lungs, your very breath.   Take from them.  Never buy another nicotine product again and make them hurt.  Feels good to inflict a little pain to your adversaries, doesn't it!       How much money are you NOT going to give them today?        Best wishes. You can do it.  Any way you can.       Chris
    Watching the money saved grow is my new addiction Chris 
From 12 O clock tonight ...smokers will have to pay 33 pence extra for a packet of cigarettes....   Due to the budget ...   Lurkers !!!!.......jump on the train now and quit !!!.....save yourself a fortune...Give yourself a pay rise instantly.....and get healthier too....
Yes lurkers, as you peruse the various posts take a look at our members tickers. The amount of money saved and cigarettes not smoked will astonish you. It still does me!Edited October 29, 2018 by jillar

Ok... so Down Under is not the place to smoke...        1 pack (Marlboro) is $34.00AUS ... which is:        £ 19        US$ 24      € 21        Can$ 31     Indian Rupee Rs 1,746       DKK kr156       It goes up periodically and by 2020 it will be $40 per pack. More than 250% of this price is tax which is supposed to go to the health budget and to education. It is a program called prohibitive pricing designed to make people quit. So any Aussie lurkers out there or any over seas people thinking of moving down under... quit now before it sends you broke or kills you... both are likely if you live in Aus.
Wow £ 19 ...I don't know how anyone in Oz can afford to smoke ..well that's one incentive to Keep The Quit ...

When i quit it was 10-11 per pack i was a pack a day. Over 300 a month i saved, Manhattan is over priced on SI 14-15 per pack roughly USD. My car lease payment i saved + what insurance cost me per month.

I just looked on-line for my state, Virginia (US).   The average price here is $4.69 per pack.   That's not much more than what it was when I quit almost 2.5 years ago.  I think it was $4.30 or so when I quit.       According to the table I saw, Virginia is the 3rd lowest in the US in terms of cost per pack.    Edited October 30, 2018 by Wayne045
I just looked on line for the brand I used to smoke.... £9.54 a packet (20) now  I smoked 20 a day, so it would be costing me nearly £70 a week now!!!!!   what a pay rise to myself
Health Canada is looking at requiring cigarette makers to print health warnings on each cigarette. If passed, this will be a first. I bet the tobacco industry won't like that! Lots of logistic and cost issues  Probably drive the cost of smokes sky high in Canada as well. They are only about $15.00 for a pack of 25 at the moment.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-health-canada-considering-warning-labels-on-individual-cigarettes/

I actually thing this is an awesome idea.
No amount of pictures or health warnings will deter smokers. After the first time you look at them you stop even noticing them.         Nobody I know has ever quit smoking because of the packaging. It's usually pregnancy, health, cost or they just didn't want to do it any longer.        I'm proud I've quit smoking but I still believe it should be a choice. Edited October 30, 2018 by LillySpelling

Your cost is for the equivalent of two of our packs so you don't pay much more than us in reality.

After the first time you look at them you stop even noticing them.                                         Nobody I know has ever quit smoking because of the packaging. It's usually pregnancy, health, cost or they just didn't want to do it any longer.                                        I'm proud I've quit smoking but I still believe it should be a choice.          I agree that pictures and words alone won't by itself convince someone to quit but, it's all part of making the choice to smoke more uncomfortable and the repetition of those images does have some effect on the smoker, whether one wants to admit it or not. Also, friends and family see the images and ask the smoker uncomfortable questions about their "habit". Chipping away at the smokers belief that THEY are the special one that won't get cancer or die minus a couple of limbs or die of a stroke or hear attack is what these negative smoking messages are all about. It's like a leaky tap - drip, drip, drip. Pretty soon, you can't ignore it. Smokers always have a choice to smoke if the want to. No one is taking that away, just making it more and more socially uncomfortable to continue to make that choice.     And yes Jo, that's what smokers are complaining about here. Smokers interviewed on the news were all up-in-arms that the government was going to make them smoke ink printed on the cigarette tubes. Now THAT would be unhealthy!Edited October 31, 2018 by reciprocity

I'm seriously militant anti-smoking since I quit so I'm even all for taking them out of stores completely and smokers have to go to a separate place to get them. Stinky butt suckers.

It said 2001 so it took me 17 years from then to quit smoking. That is why I say the impact of warnings is ignored by most. We say this is an addiction and realistically addicts don't listen to reason, they don't care as long as they get their fix.       I'm more in favour of education because as is said here regularly education is key.         If you took two sets of 100 smokers and gave the first 100 people cigarettes with a warning message on, then took the second set of 100 people round a cancer ward I'm pretty sure the second group would have more immediate quitters. Even then they would forget what they saw quite quickly as the addict in them would take over. Most of us have watched our loved ones die from smoking and then chain smoked while grieving.        I'm not saying either one of our views is right or wrong. I just hope more people stumble across sites like this because success somewhere like here is much higher than any warning on a cigarette packet.
    ^^^ I agree with what you say Lilly  When I was a smoker I scoffed at the horrid pictures on cigarette packs. You can put anything on there you like but you will not deny me my smokes! That was my attitude also but, now that I am on the other side of the issue, I would rather have them legislate anything that will make it more clear to smokers that this is not only dangerous to themselves but it's socially unacceptable now as well in most places. Beyond that what can be done? I don't believe in making them illegal. That doesn't work.      I guess what I am hoping is that these little things might in some cases bring people to sites like this one a little sooner.
    My friend started to put black tape around each packet ,when I asked ,Why ...she said so she doesn't have to look at all the horrible pictures..    If that was enough ...she then went in to the shop and asked for packets with one certain picture...and not the others...   The shop retailer had to go through them ,till he found the right pack...it was a local shop ,so she knew him...otherwise I don't think she would have been able to do this...  The lengths smokers will go ...

    There are also fancy box covers. Yep, guilty. Had a flamingo one        i always have doubs with those warnings etc. from experience, if people don’t want to quit they won’t, regardless of all the pictures. On the other hand, one can’t just not do anything and just sit and watch.

There's a guy that kicks up a stink and demands to see all the packets until he finds one that he's comfortable with..  Then you have the smoker that demands to know how much tar and nicotine is in the pack they want..  only, it doesn't tell you anymore..!!  Lots of packs have went up by  around 70p for budget but highest increase is a whopping £1.20 .. so that's 12 or 13 pounds a pack.. !!
    Some will never quit no matter what but, at least things are going in the right direction in terms of telling people the truth about nicotine addiction and the related risks!

Well I lost my elderly friend this morning.  Tough stuff.  I so loved this lady and the time I spent with her.  There will definitely be a huge void in my life.    I will admit that death and smoking is hard.  Smoking was a huge part of the very low moments in our life.  It is almost automatic to want to reach for that comfort.   As a smoker, there are times in our lives that the smoking; not the people gave us the companionship that we needed.    This definitely was a test in my quit, but instead of giving in, it helped me realize the connection that I often isolated myself when I was hurting and I smoked to ease the pain of the   hurt.   I came through okay.  I am really experiencing the emotions of the loss and crying! Am posting a picture of my friend and I on her 103rd birthday.  She almost made it to her 104th in January!
    I'm so sorry Linda, RIP to your friend .
Ahhw Linda. My condolences on the loss of your dear, dear friend. What a great picture of you both.         Smoking is isolation, that is a key discovery..     Whishing you good things, dwell in warm memoires. Please take care these coming days. X      Edited October 31, 2018 by MLMR

    Oh, my dear, Linda,     what a sad, sad day for you.    I am so sorry.  This photograph of you and your friend is beautiful and indicative of your very special relationship.

    How beautiful y'all are!!       I'm so happy for you that in these moments you can recognize the chains smoking had on you and that you are now free! Live in these emotions, enjoy the feeling of them!    Sending my love your way, friend...take some time to just breathe
    My condolences, Linda, on the loss of your lovely friend! Glad you got to be there for her at the end....RIP, Linda's lovely friend!
    Very sorry to hear this Linda 
    I'm so sorry to hear this, Linda.
    Thanks so much for the condolences.  I am so fortunate to have found your friendships at this time of my life.      It truly helps to have you all to reach out to.  Thanks so much for being there.
    Linda, my deepest condolences to you.  You have exhibited great strength, empathy and courage -- thank you for showing the way.  I am sure your friend was thankful and proud.  You have made it through one of the toughest times for quitting and you have come thru strong.  Prayers are with you!!!!
    Condolences Linda for your loss. Memories of great companionship will live on forever in you.   You and your friend were blessed with this relationship and lived it to the fullest. That's among the best life has to offer  
    Linda, I'm so sorry for the loss of your beautiful friend.  What a wonderful and rare relationship you had, and I hope you can always cherish the reciprocal comfort, companionship, and joy, you gave to each other.   
    I’m sorry to read about the passing of your dear friend. She looks like a fun gal to pal around with; her frames are awesome!       I’m glad you turned to us for comfort rather than those stinky “friends” we  have all expelled from our lives.      As you grieve, please be sure to find some quiet moments to take care of yourself. 
    Deepest condolences for the passing of your dear friend. Remember while she may be gone she is not lost, she is with you everyday in the part of your heart and soul she made her own. I know now the memories are too new and too raw but in time you will be able to remember the laughter and joy you shared.        True friendships, that breach the generation gaps, are a rare and precious thing that give so much to both. You have been truly blessed to have this lovely lady in your life, just as she was truly blessed to have you by her side in her twilight.       Know that when you look to the sky on cold day and a tendril of warm light breaks through the clouds and shines on your face, that is your friend reminding you of her love.        So very, very proud of you for holding true to your NOPE. It is such a hard thing to endure and you are so right, for years we hid from our emotions behind a cloud of smoke.... but now we are strong, and we don't need that. To move forward and grow we need to feel it all, not just the joy and happiness but also the sadness, horror and heartbreak. You can walk through this forest of darkness, you might get a few scratches and bruises but you will come out the other side and you will be stronger as a person and as a non-smoker.... because you Linda Thomas are an awesome woman with the stregth and power to achieve anything you put your mind to.
    So sorry, Linda. Sending hugs and condolences. 
    Sorry for your loss Linda. Thoughts are with you. Very impressive you kept your quit. A real test. 
    My thoughts are with you Linda x
    So sorry to hear about your loss Linda. Sending hugs and prayers.   Shows true grit that you didn't smoke...I know what a tough time this is.   But you had a lovely relationship with her, and I'm sure you have some amazing memories.     
AMAZING!!! I don't know what it is but the past couple of days I've felt great.  The craves have not been super intense and I have not been as irritable as I was the first couple of weeks. I've been really on my toes with this quit, like on edge 24/7.... always in a state of mind trying to tell myself not to smoke, not to give in. But the past couple of days I haven't felt on edge or like I could lose my quit at any moment. I feel good about my quit. And I keep reminding myself about the honey moon phase, and to not get too comfortable... but man am I enjoying this all natural high I'm feeling at the moment.
    Great positive post @I Got This (T)...great to hear you are feeling comfortable in your quit....stay on your guard...!!!!
    That's awesome!! Love it, embrace it, take it out to dinner!! Glad you're feeling good (T)...gold stars for you!
    That is so awesome T.  Once I got through the first month, I have had no urges to look back on that part of my life. So have confidence in you quit.  You will continue to get stronger and feel so much better about yourself!
    Hope the positive feelings continue for ya IGT!  Feeling great and in a positive way is the best  
    Hey IGT, amazing post, thanks for sharing. Long may it continue      
    Attitude can change everything.
Keep going - it gets so much better !!!     Not all days will be like today, but you will have more and more great days, and less and less bad days.        This is a promise !!!       Do you see the smile on my face ??? That shows perfectly how much I love life as a non-smoker.              CristóbalEdited October 31, 2018 by Cristóbal

    A quiz, a nice way to do some more rewiring (the explanation to given answers is education in itself) and at the same time to test your susceptibility to all of the Whyquit material ;-). Some questions are obviously a bit tame, but hey, we can't brainwash ourselves enough with all this knowledge!    Why Quit Smoking Quiz               
92%, not bad...got a couple of the NRT ones wrong (precentages questions) and #28 answer G. was the right answer but it was blank so I picked every other one first.    Good stuff tho; always learning
    Some of their information is wrong.  It takes longer for Nicotine to leave the body.  
98%... but I read Jane's post ^^ there first so I knew #28 was the blank G... so I kinda cheated.... we all know I knew the 1% question on NRT gum... LOL... remember that break down.... and pledge.
I got 87% but I take issue with a few of the statistics....

    That mustache is gross
** WARNING ** - I am about to talk about the death of friends and loved ones so if this is a sensitive issue for you please don't read.     I was Quit 26 days... and struggling with the quit, that third week had been hell on earth. It felt like every other minute I was fighting the urge to light up. There were two voices in my head Notsmokin Jo (NSJ) who does not smoke and Smokin' Jo (SJ) who does and boy was that Smokin' Jo loud and persistent about being heard and fed her addiction... and then at 10.30pm on day 26 my phone rang... and I dropped everything and went to my friends place... her husband had gone for a drive with his brother 3 hours early and not come home.... the internet was full of news of a horrific accident in our area..... the footage looked like it might be the car.... so while we went to the police station and my daughter stayed with her besty and her grandparents and we went to the cop shop.... the whole time SJ is in my head... "OMG this is serious shit, you can't do this you need a smoke. Like now. If you smoke you will be able to focus on what you need to do... you are such a selfish friend, how can you help if your don't have a smoke to calm the f down... enough of this quit bullshit, you need to get your act together and have a smoke then sort this stuff... you can't help if you don't smoke" ...on and on it droned along the same theme... I heard it as I sat on the floor of the cop shop cradling my friend who had collapsed.... I heard it as I drove her home.... I heard it as we sat at the table and she chain smoked and we watched my daughter hold her daughter in her arms and rock themselves to sleep... I heard it as we realised her lovely, smiley, beautiful husband was not going to come through the door any minute and laugh at us for being so silly.... I heard it as I pried his half melted keys from her hand... and as I washed and dressed her hand where the jagged edges had dug in because she was squeezing them so tight... and as I waited for the girls to fall asleep and then put out her kids chrissy presents because she couldn't go into her bedroom.... as I drove home and got my kid's pressies from Santa and put them out at her house.... as I watched her four year old ask again and again when daddy was coming home... as I watched her throw her laptop across the room so she did have to read the filth and vitriol of internet heroes trashing her dead husbands name..... as I said goodbye and drove my daughter to her dads, then my dads, then back to her dad's..... as I missed my family christmas to drive to the airport to get her mum... and drove home with her mum chain smoking in the car re-living the night before the whole time.... holding my baby while she wailed at life being unfair and how could this happen and why her friends and then after she ignored me and looked it up on the internet why people were saying horrible things about him and then the day she really broke, the day someone told her he was still alive and banging on the window as the car burnt and she had watched the footage on the internet of the car burning....and the months of nightmares..... SJ begged and pleaded and wheedled... "go on have one, just one, you know you want it, you need it".... and every time I fought the urge because that was the only thing I could control.... then on the morning of my one month anniversary the phone rings.... my uncle overseas, the oldest, has fallen and hit his head and is a coma.... so I had to watch my dad contemplate the first of his siblings to die since he was an adult... and know he couldn't for health reasons fly over.... every phone call... he is getting better.... he is worse..... come now.... every call that awful, whiny voice was begging me to smoke... but I held out... one New Years Day when the phone rang and he was gone.... watching my dad shut down... watching his other siblings who couldn't go fall apart or turn into agro nutcases.... it was just too much... but I fought the urge... and I kept my quit. It was hard, it was a battle, and truthfully it was a close call. These were real craves, not just passing thoughts... these involved sweat and determination to beat.... because my brain had been programmed that when the shit hits the fan you have a smoke (or 3) and then deal.... but I had none... I sat surrounded by smokers and did not have one... I did not increase the number of NRT I was having... if anything I decreased it.... but it was hard and for 3 weeks it felt constant. But I was not going to cave because it was the one thing in a time of chaos I had control over. I think the whole second month of my quit was one big, long, agonising crave... constantly, all day, go on, go on, go on, go on, every waking moment and if you were around the first 5 months of my quit you knew there was a hell of a lot of waking moments... on average there were 20 of those in a day..... but I fought every single one of them and I don't even really know why.... wait yes I do... it was the only thing I could control.      Then yesterday morning I get a phone call... and I just knew it was bad.... so my little cousin (35) had died of an overdose. I don't know yet if it was deliberate or accidental. But he didn't deserve to go out that way.... no one does... well maybe the real scum of the earth... but he gave back, he cared for his mum... drove over 3 hours each way every couple of days to check up on her or have dinner with her or make sure she was doing ok... he spent his weekends with her most of the time... he had been clean for years.... it just doesn't make sense.... but what did I do... I went about doing a load of washing and going to softball and cooking tea and chatting on here and doing a painting and going to sleep and going to a party and then I left the party and headed home and I lost it... bawled like a baby all the way home from the farm, I dunno how I even saw to drive my eyes were so red and swollen when I got home.... and the whole time my baby sat next to me and didn't know what to do.... she said the silent tears were the worst... but do you want to know what I didn't do? I did not fight a crave.... not one..... not once did I even get an inclining to have a smoke... not one smoking related thought at all.... HOW COULD THIS BE???????... earlier in the year I had faced a constant barrage.... like bullets from a machine gun those craves pummeled me...  sure it was much earlier in my quit.... but nothing, not one single thought, whisper, suggestion for anything smoking or nicotine related.      You see those of us who have been on the quit train for a while tell you rewards are important its all about re-wiring your brain and the nicotine receptors.... teaching your brain that smoking isn't how we reward ourselves or celebrate... in the same regards the reason the first year is so important is because we have to experience so many firsts without nicotine... season changes, holidays, stresses..... and we have to rewire our brains, rewire the triggers.... so why was there nothing this time.... its because the silver lining of the horror I ended and started this year with rewired every single receptor in my brain and trigger to do with dealing with death... all of them... so this time when the idea and concept of smoking and a nicotine fix didn't even exists... and so the silver lining of this horror is that I know how strong my quit is... I know I can face death and loss and not have to worry about facing my addiction at the same time because those receptors have all be erased and rewired to something else... a new inner strength, maybe? .... but I don't really care what it is because this is the final proof I needed that this time, this quit, this is the forever, sticky quit and while I'm only 11 months free.... I feel way beyond... whole, major sections of my brain don't even recognize nicotine's existence.... sure I'd rather still have my friend, and my uncle, and my cousin.... would probably even trade my quit for them to be here.... but giving up my quit wasn't going to bring them back or help me cope.... silver linings people... they are in any and every situation... mine in this instance are purely selfish.... but I would rather think that its the last gift these three amazing men gave me in their lifetimes... and I will treasure it always.       So newbies, and lurkers.... and the in-betweenies.... sometimes the re-wiring hurts, it cuts a deep raw wound straight through the center of your being... but those nicotine receptors do get rewired... so its up to you... are you going to do the work to re-wire... it starts with the rewards... oh yay I went an hour without a smoke... I'm going to eat this lovely strawberry / candy / celery stick.... whatever... but do something... every hour.... every two hours...every 12.... every day.....every week.... every milestone you pass.... because regardless of what shit life throws at you there is a nicotine receptor in your brain waiting to exploit it.... and you need to take the control back and re-wire those. Because it can be done.... it is done.... every day by the members here who travel this train.... get rid of the smokes and the vapes and start re-wiring.... you have the power within you to totally change your life and your brain... how fricking amazing is that!
    Great post Jo! You're absolutely right on the mark too!     Most, if not all of us, will be challenged by something going off the rails in life during the early stages of our quits. Yours was a number of extreme and unusual situations but your point being that sooner or later the resolve of our commitment will be put to the test and that's the moment that separates the men from the boys and the women from the girls. Just because we stopped smoking doesn't mean life stops for us but, it gives us the opportunity to prove to ourselves just how strong we can be when something is important enough to us.       I'm sorry for all your troubles Jo but I'm also glad you made it through those times smoke free. That will be a shining light for you forever. You will forever know you can do virtually anything           
    Nothing else to say...      Sometimes I can't be grateful enough that the universe has all of here at the same time.
    Such an inspirational post for everyone. Your strength and determination with so much sadness in your first year is amazing and I'm not sure I could have kept my quit with so much tragedy as you had/have to deal with. Thank you for sharing jo xoxo
    A beautiful honest post...  I am sorry to learn your life was full of sadness at the beginning of your quit..   You are a remarkable strong lady....it shows us ,just how much you were determined to kick this horrible addiction...   Your a inspiration....  Thank you for sharing this with the board...    Hoping it will give lurkers , just the help they needed...to take a seat...xxxx
    Jo, your story breaks my heart.  Your suffering has been insurmountable.  I so admire your courage and strength.  The fact that you did not cave during these difficult times shows how much determination you have.  You are an inspirational to us all.  I wish I could be there to just hold and comfort you. 
    So inspirational Jo... xx
"What if someone dies?"     As my addicted mind went into overdrive in the days before I quit, I asked myself that question.  My thinking at the time was, there are certain life events in which it is totally impossible to even consider not smoking.  The death of someone close to me was the big one, the clause that would give me full permission to continue feeding my addiction, but there were others.      Then I had to face reality.  In 2007 I watched my beloved grandfather die after a long battle with cancer.  In 2012, I lost my brother-in-law in a tragic accident.  During both of those times in my life I smoked one right after another.  All those cigarettes.  All that nicotine...didn't change a damn thing.  Someone I loved was gone.  The people in my life that mean the most to me were all hurting.  My heart was broken.     The cigarette offers us nothing.  Whether it's just another day or the worst day of your life, there is no comfort to be found in a pack of cigarettes.

This April ..I lost my life long companion.... The best friend anyone could ever wish for....   We are together every day....for 62 or more years....   I am numb....I still expect her to walk through my door ... She died of a smoking related illness.... It hurts to know I can help people here quit ...but not my best friend....    She still believed cigerettes offered her something...  It took cancer 12 weeks to do its worse.... I never once considered a cigarette.... I have heard ,learned..seen ..that smoking would not change a dam thing.....
@DoreensfreeI love you lady 
    (((Hugs))) to you Jo, you are one strong amazing woman. I have always worried about the death of a loved one too, and thought that would be the one thing that would instantly make me smoke.   God forbid I never will experience what you have, and may God give me the strength to not smoke if I do.    x
Jo, now that's how you test a quit. My wife and I have lost her dad and my dad to lung cancer, and lost her mom, all in the last year to five years ago. DW has never quit. I never threw away my quit 5 years ago. I won't be smoking at her funeral but she'll be smoking at mine. It's a choice, and a matter of self control. That's all it is. GREAT Post!     KTQ

    Jo, you have a gift for writing, for expressing complicated feelings in fairly simple, raw terms -- but more importantly you have a wonderful capacity for empathy and humanity, which both seem to be in much shorter supply in this world every day.  Thank you for that, and for seeing the positives in the negatives, no matter how lopsided they may seem at times.

Seriously, have you ever thought about starting your own quit clinic?       Thanks so much for taking the time to write all of this down, Jo. The beauty is, it's very educating to others and at the same time I bet it plays a part in your own journey (heading towards one year, you go girl!). You have a lot to look back at.. darn. Do know your story is rediculously inspiring!

But your story is inspiring too and Linda's and Doreens and Jillars and Joe7s and Alberts and Sazeracs and G67 and Parsley and Jet Black and everyone single other person here.. we all face really awful things in our lives at times, I just lucked out and had a whole heap happen in my first year quit... but silver lining... I don't have to face them down the track... major health issues, work redundancy, betrayal, deaths, family issues....they are all things you could face at anytime... getting them over with in the first year is just like rapid detox. We are all traveling our own roads and we are all facing lifes challenges and our quits at the same time... but its important to know that when we say you are re-wiring your brain and the receptors it is so true...it really works. When things got dicey about if I would or wouldn't light up and there were moments I had my fellow travellers here to help me stay the course... I had the people I played games with over at qsmb to keep my mind occupied with things besides the drama and the craves.        For a few months I have been playing lip service to this is my sticky quit... but the weekend prooved it... I am quit, I am never going back NOPE is the only reality I know.

What an amazing inspirational post Jo, you're a strong, determined and awesome gal...super awesome actually.        And yes, we all are dealing with a lot of things but it takes courage and lucidity of thought to put this out here, and it inspires people. I keep having Triggers nowadays (not cravings) of smoking, and all I have to do is close my eyes and say a firm no, and poof, they vanish.  It's not easy saying no sometimes, but I remember why I said no in the first place. I don't want to ever again be a slave to this disgusting habit, I never want to stink till the high heavens, lose my breath climbing 2 flights of stairs (I still do, but that's because of my weight :p )Mainly, I don't want to feel compelled to act like a tripped out zombie if I don't get my "fix", be irritable, lurk in corners, hide that smoke when I see kids and elderly people (reflex action).    So thank you for sharing, makes me realize that I cannot let my mind use any instance in my life to lead me to light up a smoke. That's not happening, ever.
    Thank you, Jo.  You are a great inspiration to all  and help all of us keep our quit.   Thank you so much.  S
Great message, we all can stay quit under the meanest of circumstances,  because it's a choice and that's all it is. They blow smoke in our faces in any circumstance, we're quit for life,  lending some dignity and meaning to the concept of QUIT. How many have we had die in our personal lives and on this and the other board after quitting? We didn't go running off to smoke, too strong for that.  I know off at least 10 in my life but I'm old but it will come at you so be ready.  Doreen so very sad to read of your loss, I wish I had been around...      KTQ         Markus
    Thank you Markus ...    Have sent you a message ....xx
    Big magic.
I'm 9 months 21 days from my last puff. I smoked a pack a day for 34 years.  I did the work. You folks (and QSMB) were my crutch, my parole officer, my defense attorney and my Mom, but I did the work.        The Good        I haven't smoked. That statement still seems a bit unreal. I haven't smoked 8,251 cigarettes. That's a milestone that blows me away. I don't really crave very often. It doesn't seem like there are very many times when smoking is even part of my life anymore. I also have my first grandbaby and I'm really excited that i won't smoke and stink around her. No coughing anymore. I feel like I really didn't cough that much after I quit.        The Bad     Occasionally I put myself in familiar situations that have an unfamiliar feel to them. I played a gig in a room where people were smoking both cigarettes and pot (I live in Canada and it's now legal here). Trying to sing was a little rough with smoke in the air, it had been a long time since I played anywhere you could smoke inside.  I'm still not comfortable with all moments (family, work) and occasionally it crosses my mind that I am missing something. Also, at work occasionally my smoke break is interrupted by my not smoking.  I haven't really had much in the way of giant improvements in my health. I think I breath a little easier.      The Ugly        I have a little blockage in the airways running up my neck. It's uncomfortable sometimes, and pisses me off other times. It makes me mad as it wouldn't be there if I'd have quit one of the many other times I'd tried.    I think i developed some anxiety since I quit. I'm a little unsure of what it is or how to properly to describe it to a physician. Sometimes I'm a little overwhelmed that I may have a stroke or heart attack. My balance gets a little funky, and my migraines have continued. I had an odd migraine a day or two ago that as new as I can tell was an ocular migraine. This was new and a little scary but I suppose just part of growing older. I have moments of balance issues and this is disconcerting. Just seems like for no reason I feel a little like I'm gonna fall. I don't really remember this from before I quit smoking.     I'm sure that I quit way later than I should have, but I quit. I'm done and thats a win.        I keep tabs on all you folks so don't go getting in any trouble.        Peace   R
It is good that you posted about the good, the bad, and the ugly.  I to have issues about those 3 points and still wrapping my head around them, but I try to focus on "The Good" -- to me that is important and had I not quit (looks like we chose the same day) I would not have those good things to focus on and after 44 years of smoking that is a blessing.  Continue to march on, you are doing well!!!
    Great post Rory and I'm so happy that you have found your forever quit  Sorry about the bad and ugly going on with you, I have some of that too and am unsure just how much is smoking related and just plain getting older  But the important thing is that by not smoking we have stopped, hopefully, the progression of smoking related problems. Oh and the anxiety? I've seem to have gotten that as well since quitting. Hangovers seem to bring it on so again, not sure if its just getting older or the quit.... Thanks for the update, enjoy that granddaughter of yours  
    Thank you  for the great update....you have a great quit...but am sorry Also  to hear of the ugly bits..... Nice to know your never too far away....
    Hey RoryPlog, thanks for the update. How much easier do you find singing now you don't smoke?       With the health things please see the doctor... they have heard people explain things in any number of ways so don't worry about that and not knowing will only be making the anxiety worse.... but for your beautiful grandbaby girl please just pop in for a visit and get everything checked.        Don't waste time and energy regretting that you smoked to long... because your smoked, its a fact, we all did, we can't change that fact... we can't go back in time and stop it or quit sooner... so leave it, it is what it is... live in the now and NOW you have QUIT. You are smoke free... that is what is important you can control the now and change the now, same as you can determine what you do in the future... keep your energy for those not what has gone before.      So glad your still here and lurking. Lover when you get a chance to post.
    Good to hear from you Rory-sorry to read about the blockage. Could it be contributing to the headaches and feeling off balance? Please have a physician keep an eye on it! That would make me anxious as well.    What a wonderful gift you’ve given yourself with your  ever growing quit!  Please keep taking good care of yourself.

I feel as though I run out of air a little quicker than I used to. Strangely I have had to re-learn some techniques for singing. It seems as though I have more power, and a little more range than I used to. That said, I now how to be a little more conscious of pitch and how much 'volume' I am sending towards a microphone.  The clarity of my voice is much better even after only 9 months of no smoking. The other good thing is I don't seem to 'blow out' my voice from drinking whiskey and smoking a thousand cigarettes. I really appreciate you asking this question. It has helped me add another point to the "Good" section of my post. :-)   PeaceR

Please take all of these seriously and get yourself an appointment and keep us updated. We worry, you know.     You have built yourself a really fine quit, Rory,   congratulations on your almost 10 months of Freedom.    You are doing tremendous work, for true.    Sing !  Loud and Clear.  You are a hero.

I worked with musos for 16 years and many smoked. I had heard both arguments that giving up would ruin your voice (which even junky me doubted) or it would improve it. I always thought it would improve, especially range and projection... it was wonderful to hear your personal story and you know what... there will be lurkers out there who will have the misplaced fear that it will be bad for their voice to quit and you just might have given them the final push to get over the quit line, talk about paying it forward.       I do agree with Sazerac though, please see a doctor and get a check up... it's probably nothing, just your body clearing out years of smoking but we do worry, even if your not a daily poster, we worry about our fellow travelers.
    Triggers can come out of nowhere, and in order to understand them and beat them down, you have to expect them, or recognize them for what they are - just a habit that you need to break.  Here's an interesting example.  I was over six months into one of my previous quits, working on a baseball diamond preparing it for our Opening Day games.  A friend of mine was running a Bobcat loader moving some dirt onto an infield - something we do every year.  He brings it to the diamond with the loader, I spread it out on the infield with the field groomer.  In previous years, anytime he would leave to go get more dirt, I'd reach for a smoke.  He turned and left, and I reached for Salem Lights.  Except this last time, I didn't have any because I hadn't smoked in months!  But the trigger was there, and I fell for it for a second or two and reached for the pack without even thinking about it, recognized what it was and had a good laugh, happy that I was still smoke free.  Like I said, a trigger out of nowhere...
    Our bodies have memories, conditioned responses to feelings or situations and addiction makes full use of this. It takes a while to change all this up.         You are right @Baseball Coach, "they are just a habit that you need to break' ...just a habit that you CAN break.       Congratulations on your quit, Coach, good to see you around.     
    Thanks @Baseball Coach for bringing this up. I trained myself  in recognizing them, in the beginning of my quit. I am now at a point where it really annoys me to take time to examine triggers  (most of the time they are just that.. not even craves). This reminds me how important it is to see them every time for what they are: patterns.       Changing seasons, for instance. Brings up different thoughts/moods etc. Tempting time to lay back and dwell in self pity, because of aaaaallllll the triggers 'that are still here'. While its got probably everything to do with unconciously remembering what I did as a smoker at this time of the year.          
    The good news is: years of conditioning ourselves with cigarettes can be eliminated in one-year of reconditioning our bodies and minds.  The changing of seasons, special occasions, etc. can trigger smoking thoughts.  It can feel a little awkward, maybe even a bit uncomfortable, but with a bit of resolve the new ways begin to feel normal.     It gets easier with time and eventually becomes a mere afterthought.
    To me, it's only memories.
Once a person has reached their first year anniversary, they have experienced most of their triggers.       That is why the first year anniversary is so important - this amount of time covers most situations in which the triggers can occur.            The longer you stay quit, the more time you have to experience these triggers, and just say no to them.     Eventually, almost all of them will disappear forever.          When you do experience a trigger, always keep this in mind: "A TRIGGER (or any CRAVE) IS NEVER A COMMAND".      Recognize a trigger for what it is - the weak ghost of a sleeping drug addiction - and just ignore it.      It will disappear, and then probably never return again, and that means you just gained some more freedom.          CristóbalEdited October 26, 2018 by Cristóbal
    Wow, uncanny how  I've been thinking along similar lines.       How I was wondering about so many instances where, whether happy or sad, stressed or excited, my response would be to have a smoke. And though there's been no trigger as such, I'm quite wary of one popping up suddenly. This is an interesting read because it reminds me how I still can be tricked by my mind and "constant vigilance" (Potter fans would recognize this phrase) is the only way forward.
    After two years, I think most of my triggers are gone.  But you never know.   Thanks to all for participating and helping others stay strong.
So I am less than two hours away from being 6 days into this quit.  In some ways it feels so insignificant when I think how long a quit I gave up last time, but hey ho, must carry on regardless.  Am finding this time a little harder because my life is such a bloody mess at the moment. But I'm doing my best to keep busy, I even cooked myself a healthy dinner tonight to make up for my awful day yesterday (although i did have a huge bar of chocolate earlier!).       I also went to the animal refuge again.  This is a picture of me and a beauceron called Jude.  He's only four years old and nearly blind.  He has a genetic disease which means he will totally lose his sight eventually.  Sad thing is he has come in with his son and four daughters......they too are nearly blind.  But my, what beautiful souls they have. It bought tears to my eyes spending some time with them.  I know this is not smoking related per se, but it helps me to focus on something else.
Congratulations on 6 days, Pumpkin.     I think it is great what you are doing at the animal refuge and I'm glad it is helping to keep your mind off of smoking.
^^^ Yes! What Johnny said!   
6 days already? Seems like you just got here and suddenly it's almost a week already        Keep it up!
Aww beautiful picture...what a great way to spend some time...  Well done Pumpkin...6 days is a very significant  quit...x
Congrats, those first 6 days are brutal. Good job
    Congrats on almost being done with hell week pumpkin and I too think it's a great thing what you're doing for the animals. He seems very happy to see you

    Yes, giving your time at a place like this is not only a great distraction for you in the early days of your quit but so important to those animals who through no fault of their own find themselves in need of human companionship. You can provide food and water for animals but they all need that human connection - even cats who seem so independent most of the time.      Great work Pumpkin!!
Congrats on 6 days free from the chains of smoking slavery, Pumpkin!!   Keep those doggie kisses coming, I love it!!
    One week free from cigerette slavery!!  Celebrate, Pumpkin! Do a little dance, kiss every dog you see, and really be proud of yourself! You are worth it!
    Hey Pumpkin!! Just squirreling in here to see how you are doing...  Hope you are feeling good, give us a shout if you need some cheers!

Agree 100% - we hate to see people willingly jump off the train and yes; it's a conscious decision one makes to either continue their quit or go back to slowly killing themselves by smoking! If you truly WANT to quit and are having a hard moment - post up on the SOS page. That's what it's there for. You WILL get responses and fast. All you have to do is hang on for a few minutes and someone will give you some useful input. Can't count how many quits have been saved by SOS posts. Sadly, even more lost when no SOS is posted
    I was just sitting outside watching the late afternoon sun and clouds and enjoying a simple serenity.  I came to realize that I could smell autumn again.  I remember that when I was younger I always enjoyed the smell of autumn.  This may not seem all that impactful to others but it is huge to me -- many, many memories and feelings long suppressed have come back.  One more thing that I am grateful for and can use if any cravings come along.  Quitting smoking has brought so many simple pleasures back!!!!
    I remember when my sense of smell and taste came back, funny thing is I didn't know it was gone until I got it back! Enjoy your Autumn smells 
    Can relate. The southwest desert has a smell like no other this time of year if you get out of the city Delightful! Enjoy your quit and hang in there! Best wishes.
It's these small things that often make the biggest impact on us as we transition through the seasons of the first year of our quit. Enjoy to the max M5
    Smoking covered and muffled all our senses, it is such a pleasure to hear of your re-discovery. Breathe deep your magnificent Autumn !
    Yes! Drying leaves, wet dirt, fire places  Ahhhhh....non-smokers have the good life! Enjoy!
Here is another one -   I remember when you went through your own three month battle. And now, it is almost 10 months, and close to a year.
    ^^^^^  Oh so true Jet Black, thanks for that memory!!!
    Yes... the other day I was outside and it was hot and I could smell the rain coming... you know that dusty, hot ashfelt, nirtogen in the air smell before a thunderstorm.... haven't smelt that in years and I love the rain is coming smell.        
Hi all,     Celebrating 10 months smoke free tomorrow.  I had a day a few weeks back after a terrible night's sleep when I was THIS close to buying or bumming a smoke, and was at the point where I considered writing an SOS.  But I gathered my thoughts, recounted my reasons, and stayed quit.     My daughter kissed me goodbye when I dropped her off at school today, and said "You smell so nice, mom."        Small moments with huge rewards.
    You know yourself now, how bad smokers STINK! I feel like saying to folk, omg, you STINK? Haha.     Good for you, ten months and going strong  
    You're doing awesome and how nice it is for your daughter to notice that! I'm really happy for you farmgirl  
CELEBRATING 10 MONTHS FREE!!!   Scream that to the world! Let it out because how wonderful for you and your family! Congrats Farmgirl!  Never give up, never give in! This is the start of the rest of your smoke free life and how sweet it is!
I'm glad you didn't light up, Farmgirl.  Weird cravings and smoking thoughts do pop up on occasion months after you've quit but they become weaker and less frequent with time.  I hope that is the case for you.       I'm amazed at how bad smokers smell now.  That's one of the great rewards for quitting - not smelling like that anymore.        Congrats on 10 months smoke free.  You have done a great thing in quitting.
I Don't exactly feel like smoking but feeling incredibly sad and vulnerable.  We are still on vacation and my 103 yr. old lady friend that I care for is having heart failure.  They have sent her home with hospice.  I am afraid she will pass before I get home.  I love this lady so much and just expected her to live forever.  She has done so well and this is so sudden.  We have two days before we are home.  I guess I need prayers for what is best.  I Don't know if it will be hard for me if she passes before I get home or better for me.  I do know I will be very broken hearted with her not in my life.  She was one special lady.
Hey Linda, hang in there.  It's a difficult 2 days for sure.        I think you did great posting here.
    I'm so sorry about your friend Linda, is there anyway for you to get home in time to see her? If not, maybe you can call her and tell her how much she means to you?
    These few days are going to be hard for you, friend.    You've spoken of this woman before and I know she has been a good friend, a balm for you.   The world will be a sadder place without her.       Plus, you are picking up your parents at the casino for the ride home ? Oh, brother. Oh dear.   I will be thinking of you and sending all goodness and kindness.    Stay close to the board, Linda. Your troops are here.    
    Geez, I forgot you have to pick up your folks. Call your loser brother and tell him you have an emergency and he will have to go to pick up your parents
    I did call her.  She is very depressed and did not want to talk but I did tell her I love her.  I am not sure if she knows this is her time.  Her niece has kept me informed.  We have to retrieve my mom and dad from the casino.  We are going to tell them we have to go home a day early.  
    Oh Linda my heart goes out to you. I am positive you bring as much love to her life as she does to yours.       I will keep you all in my thoughts and prayers x     
@Sazerac I will keep close I know you are there for me.  The trip home with my parents will be tough.  They do lack empathy and will be upset they have to go home.  
Can't you just leave them there, indefinitely?      I am so sorry for this sudden change in your friends health. I know how special she is to you. 103 is an amazing life. She has seen so much and been a part of so much history. To be 103 and still at home speaks of her character and her support network. I am glad you have spoken with her and hope that you get to visit with her again before her time comes. Her friendship and love is something you will have always, long after she has gone her light will shine on always in your heart.       Stay close, we are here, and all my love for the car trip home with the parental units.... still think you should just leave them at the casino.... I will keep you and your friend in my prayers.
    I'm so sorry linda 
I lift you and your friend to the Lord, Linda Thomas.   There is strength in numbers and we are here for you!!  Many hugs and many loves and maybe a stick or 2
    I am praying for you, Linda....and your dear friend! 
    Wow! This is very unfortunate news. Sorry to hear your friend has taken a sudden turn for the worse health wise. Double whammy having to deal with your overbearing parents on the drive home. I hope you can just tune them out while you remember all the goodness your friend has brought into your life over the years. I'm sure the feeling is mutual with your friend. Let us know how you're doing when you can please. You have an army of quitters here ready and willing to support you. 
    Dear Linda, I am so sorry to hear this.         Glad you take the oldies home early. They probably won't understand anyway but that doesn't matter. But for you I whish you can be with whatever emotion you have, without having to deal with them in ways that are too demanding right now.       Promiss to post whenever you want. That goes for the SOS section as well.  Take care!
    Prayers any hugs Linda....  Please have a safe journey home.... You and your friend have been blessed to have a friendship that you have together...    Stay close..... You have good friends here...who will support you through this journey.....xx
    Oh Linda, I’m so sorry. Words aren’t enough in such situations. You’ve had beautiful friendship, it is something to cherish, even through tears. 
    Thinking of you, you beautiful and powerful smoke free woman !
@Sazerac I know you are and that you have my back.  Well the old folks threw a tantrum and refused to go home.  We are leaving Saturday morning to head home.  Needless to say I am very aggravated at them but so much wiser.      I do believe, with my new found confidence and the support of my quit buds, I have the strength to not allow them to take advantage anymore.  I do count and need to start putting myself first.    I might need a few good vibes sent my way to get through the drive home and my mom's whining.   My husband and I had a nice time.  It is amazing how different your life is without the smoking chain around your neck.     My friend is hanging on.  I almost think she is waiting for me to get home. Thanks, my dear forum friends, for being there and @c9jane29 for all my lovely sticks.
    I'm glad your friend is hanging in there Linda, I sure wish that you had of stood up to your parents and told them to leave now or find their own way home! Once you finally do that you will get such a feeling of pride in standing up for yourself. I just know it

Pissy parents, cold nights, alien smokers listen up: Linda Thomas says NOPE! so get out of her way! Prayers, friend...
    Sending my prayers Linda.... and you most definitely do count. You are Linda, we hear you roar. How does quitting feel... liberating. 
    Prayers coming from Liverpool too Linda...  You arrived to spend time with your special friend.... This is all that mattered...enjoy every moment you can together...   Your uncaring parents...will have to get accustomed to thier new strong daughter... I'm proud of you...
    Hope you are home and able to be with your friend.  Please take a lot of time for yourself, Linda, grieve and rejoice over her life.     
    Thinking of you Linda and hope you are ok. We are all here for you whenever you need us.        It will be a long path but you'll never be walking it alone. 
Well we are home and safe.  It was a long ride home with my parents because they are not happy we won't be taking them back to the casino.  I also told my mom I was going to spend more time giving care to my friend so she can stay in her home till the end.  I do hope to have a little more time with her but realize she is 103.   My mom will just have to count on my brother to help and pay to have her groceries delivered.     Thanks for all the words of encouragement.  I don't know what I would do without you all.
The beautiful thing about being successful at quitting smoking is that you suddenly realize that you can now do anything and, that you are worth doing things that will improve the quality of your life. You too are now doing this Linda. Keep moving forward  Live your life the way YOU want to. Help others but NOT at your own expense!Edited October 20, 2018 by reciprocity
    Glad you're home Linda and you've made it on time to be there for your friend. I'm so proud of you for standing up to your parents, big hug coming your way!

Being with those near death is very much like being a mid-wife. You can make the ending so much better, kinder, calmer. Be sure to nurture yourself while you nurture her...        I am so proud of you for the progress you have made.    Not only have you quit smoking, you have now garnered a nice batch of power and are able to set reasonable boundaries with your parents.    Little adjustments will make a real difference in your life.    Later, you can make larger adjustments as your needs change and your power grows.       Hold tight to your resolve....not only your commitment to NOPE  but, your commitment to yourself to make your life a sweeter and kinder place.      love,   s
So Relieved for you Linda,you made it home ,to spend valuable time with your special friend.... It's so important you get to say Goodbye to your friend by her side....I have just experienced this for myself....  What a grand old lady ...I wonder what her advice would be to live a full happy life to 103.....    You said NO to your folks ...how empowering did that feel...good I'm imagining....  I agree when we Quit ...it gives us the strength in other aspects of our lives....we can do anything ....   Enjoy your time together...xx
    Glad you're home safe and sound, friend!!   Take some time for Linda only now!! I read on MLMRs thread that you like crafts and such but feel like you let yourself get away from doing those kind of things... I think now is the perfect time to start again. It will help occupy your hands and mind as these emotional times come up. Idle hands are the devil's play thing.        Hugs and loves for you as always!!       
    I found this funny; made me think of you and @notsmokinjo dog talk over in Stick alley...       Hope you have a great new day as a non-smoker! 
    Hey @Linda Thomas apologies for seeing this so late. Hope you are doing well, and hope your friend is better.       She's in my prayers too. God bless you for the strength you've shown in keeping your quit. That's amazing. Stay strong.
I have not smoked, not even a little cheat poot puff puff, in 2 weeks!!! It feels good. It's the second longest quit I've had. Still walking on egg shells and having mad cravings, but minute by minute I am making it as a non smoker.    N.O.P.E.
    This. Is. Awesome!      Keep it up! One day at a time is all you can do. Give yourself an "atta girl" every night when you go to bed and a pep talk every morning when you get up. Take lots and lots of deep breaths and really try to pay attention to just how deep and good those breaths feel now compared to two weeks ago.       You can do this!
Well done....you have every right to feel proud...your half way to that important first month ....  Jim is spot on...1 day at a time....    Keep NOPE...ing  ...
    Hell week and Heck week are behind you! Now just put the babe thread behind you and lemme pay you women back for hijacking boo's thread ....            Good job
Congrats (T)!! Reward yourself every day to reinforce all the hard work you've put in the past 2 weeks.     ETQ to KTQ!!
    Congratulations on getting past your first two weeks!
    Great job... you can do this.... keep up the great work.
Way to show those horses asses you mentioned who have been tempting you to start up again.  You certainly showed them who's in charge    Edited October 24, 2018 by reciprocity

Good job!    Edited November 19, 2018 by Boo
GREAT JOB  2 weeks is wonderful.
    Congratulations IGT. Two weeks is BIG.  Before you know it this will become your longest quit ever.  Until then, NOPE.
Great news, IGT.  You are making it through the roughest days.  Keep up the great work and don't forget to reward yourself for the awesome job you are doing.Edited October 24, 2018 by johnny5
    Yay IGT, congrats on being done with hell week AND heck week! You're doing GREAT! 
    Awesome! 
    Awesome stuff  IGT, keep your quit...great to see your hard work and determination pay off.
Here is an introductory article about NicA2Nicotine Eating Bacteria that was published a few years ago   and a brand new sci/nerd publication from NCBIAn enzymatic approach reverses nicotine dependence, decreases compulsive-like intake, and prevents relapse
    Crazy cool...hopefully it will one day replace the nrt that contain nicotine.
Very tired. Soooooo extremely tired. I got good sleep last night, but after I woke up I napped off and on until noon and have been lounging around ever since. I don't remember being this exhausted in my last quit attempts ( I have had 2... One lasted a couple of months and the other a couple of days.) On the bright side cravings have been minimal today, probably because I'm so freaking tired and getting my happy ass up to go outside is waaaaaaaay too much work.
    That does sound strange, in that you say you got a good sleep and all. I do remember feeling very tired every day in the early days of my quit but I always assumed it was because mentally I was fighting the early quit symptoms so hard each day that it just wore me out. That and I just wanted to be asleep as often as possible because it made the craving for a smoke go away for awhile   As with all quit symptoms, I'm sure this too will pass but yes, it's annoying when you need to get stuff done, go to work etc. and you're dog-tired  
    It might not be quit related.... worst symptom of first trimester is fatigue.. your not up the duff are ya?     Seriously though, it seems to be a pretty even split with quitters they are either very fatigued when they first quit or they have quit insomnia and cant sleep for want of trying. Give it a couple of weeks and if its not improving I'd see ya doc just to make sure all is good.
    Sounds like me when I first quit, its very normal. Sleep as much as you can, you cant smoke then 
    I was extremely tired too so I agree it's normal, should get better soon. But if not I also agree to see your dr.  
    Yep was same for me.. could hardly drag my arse outta bed some days..

Definitely not pregnant..... hubby is fixed and Aunt Flow just phoned and said she'll be here in a few days for a visit.
    Yup. It's official. Everyone in this ******* town KNOWS I quit smoking. Even total strangers. Even the people on tv ffs!! They ALL know!! And for whatever reason they are all purposely trying to irritate the hell out of me. They are all thinking " won't it be fun to try and make Mary crack!!??" Yup. Every. Last. One. Of. Them.    And I know what you're all thinking... you're thinking I'm just being super sensitive because I quit smoking. Nope. Not it at all. Clearly everyone just has it out for me. Bastards.
    Not everybody.!!!!!!    You have a train full of supporters here... This is YOUR Quit....who cares what other folks think...    There were shall I say..quite a few doubters when I quit this time...well i had quit that many times ..to them this was just another feeble attempt...  But it didn't matter....I was Quitting for me....not for them...    Just hang around here...we will always give you a well earned pat on the back ...    
 Feelings, nothing more than feelings         Anger boiling in me         I want to punch their faces                                             (but i don't) Woh-uhoh... Can't go to wal-mart; I'll get stuck behind an old fart       In a motorized fat cart....         Stop at a red light; give the finger to a hot wife                 Her smoke is getting in my car!!   Feeelings..who-ooh-uhoh Can't take them out, but I can't hold them in!! where oh where do I begin??...                              (I don't know so...)    I'll just keep punching faces from within.  (Insert glitter bomb here)      It's okay, (T)!! I had a huge anger problem when I first quit...sometimes I can still feel my blood pressure rise.  Eat some chocolate, make sure you are giving yourself breaks (just to take a step back like you used to as a smoker just no cigarettes) You got this, girl!      
Like Doreen said, you're quitting for YOU and a better future for you and your family. Screw anyone who threatens that in any way. They don't deserve your attention for 1 second. You need to expend all your focus, anger and joy on one thing alone. Getting yourself quit and staying that way. You KNOW you can do it! It's now just a matter of whether your commitment is iron-clad because you also know it must be to get you through to freedom.
    Sorry you're having a rough patch I got this but it's totally normal for where you are in your quit and I promise you it will pass. AND like Doreen said you have a whole train behind you so when someone pisses you off just say "choo choo". It'll totally trip them out and maybe give you a giggle 
    I remember thinking,    'why did I not notice all these fcukers before ?    How have all these irritations been hidden from me all these years ? '  True, smoking masks a lot but, surely, not that much...gah.     I definitely blew my cool when I quit.  Even more when I quit caffeine !    Thankfully, it settles down and isn't right up in your face after a while.  lol.        Go down to the railroad tracks, wait for a train and practice your primal screaming.    Extremely therapeutic.   
    Ooh, Mary.....Hell Week/Month! I remember it well....everything and everyone around me irritated the hell out of me....and I blasted them for it!   I was impossible to be around myself....but as Saz states above...it all settles down eventually! Deep breathing helped.....
Thanks for all of your replies!!! I feel much better after sleep. One more 10 hr shift.... it's Sunday so there shouldn't be too many crazies out..... I hope.... but it's also my Friday so I will have the next 2 days off, yay!
    That's great! Sorry you have to deal with the crazies as part of your job. I'm sure a lot of them are smokers too. The rest of us can just avoid those types in the early days of our quits. You unfortunately can't. Extra challenge but you can handle it I'm sure   Don't forget to be extra kind to yourself in these early days too. You have extra on your plate at the moment.
    Hi Mary     FEK them all    its your life your extending stick with it.

Me too!  My husband used to point them out all the time and I always thought he was just a crabby old man.  Then, all of a sudden they started jumping out at me!   Well ten hour shift is enough to put you over the edge.  How do you do it!      The first part of my quit, I wanted to strangle everyone.  Fortunately everyone survived!   Hang in, you are doing great.
    Are they scoffing at the fact that you quit?    Is it one of those rude things like, "Oh yeah, SURE you quit smoking. Huh huh huh"?     If so, let me tell you a little secret -    When we have an established quit, say a few months, we get to start talking shit We get to be like, "So, I quit MY bad habit, when you gonna quit yours?"    If they are scoffing, then LET THEM SCOFF! It will be more motivation to flip nicotine the bird AND when you prove the naysayers wrong, they can no long mess with you.     BUT if it is just a matter of noticing what dipwads people really are - That partially passes but beware - people start driving a little worse every time someone quits nicotine.   
I have just seen the BBC reporting that Phillip Morris the manufacturers of Marlboro are advising Smokers in the UK to Quit smoking cigarettes.     But they are advising them to take up vaping or e cigs.     Its hard to believe that they are trying to recruit people to other forms of smoking to keep their business going.      Im not sure they should be allowed to do it.https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=Philip+Morris+Quit+Smoking&amp;qpvt=philip+morris+quit+smoking&amp;FORM=EWREEdited October 22, 2018 by despair not
That is ridiculous.... I am beginning to hate vaping and e cigs as much as I hate normal cigs. I am not sure that they are as prolific here yet.        So this story is a bit sad, and I agree I don't think they should be allowed to do it either.       On the plus side, I heard in the NEWS here that Britain now has more ex-smokers than they have current smokers... but I'm not sure if vapers are included in that figure.       Here is an article on the smoking numbers and smokers being far outnumbered by ex-smokers.... way to go Great Britain...     https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/number-of-uk-smokers-falls-to-lowest-level
    Gday    You'd think these companies would also want another world war to come along to boast thier sales as well.....   Not satisfied that we have figured out Nicotine and its various delivery    systems actually kill the customer .... funny about that.   C
    I've just heard this ....Words fail me....they are nothing short of murdering B*******s......   Somewhere down the line ....e cigs will be proven to kill folks too.... It's great news Britain has more Quitters...than Nicotine smokers...
I had heard about this too! I heard UK governments were pushing to ban single use filters and control unnecessary packaging.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/environment/cost-cigarettes-rise-tobacco-industry-smoking-environment-who-climate-change-pollution-a8564796.html%3famp
    Phillip Morris is a bunch of bastards. If they said vegetables were healthy, i probably would not believe them. It is not unusual for companies to divert customers away from one of their OWN products only to push a different one.       I do not get though -   Even if vaping is less harmful, less expensive, less illegal, etc, isn't quitting altogether COMPLETELY free, legal, and healthy?       Free, now THAT is a word us Sagittarius like. And us cheap skates.
    I am sure you all guessed that I smoked on my birthday due to my lack of updates.       I drank way too much and learnt that I can't be trusted around alcohol.         I wasn't sure whether I should show my face here again and feel really embarrassed. I realised today that beating myself up was not helping in any way. I was just running towards smoking and getting further away from a quit. So I've stopped the self pity and restarted the clock.                  
If you have learned a lesson because of what happened to you on the weekend and can put that to use in your new quit then that's a good thing. You shouldn't worry about what others might think but be only concerned for your own well being and that would include a successful quit! That one should be at the top of your list for a better life. You did all the planning before so, let's get you off those smokes for good. Stay close to this place for the first while anyway. Support and education about smoking is important in the early days.

    Thanks Reci.        Pottanramu I'm a bit confused why you did a laughing smiley?
    I don't keep any cigarettes Pottanramu. That would be a disaster waiting to happen.         I'm staying well away from alcohol Whispers. 
    Well, now you know alcohol and birthdays are triggers; please stay away from both!! I'm glad you realized that a birthday isn't any excuse to forget about quitting.    This time we commit to the quit! we embrace the quit!  we love the quit! This quit is the one that will save your life.
    Agree with everything Jane especially this -        This﻿ time we commit to the quit! we embrace the quit!  we love ﻿the quit! This quit is the one that will save your life.﻿﻿
    Glad you're back Lilly after all you did promise to show us all those awesome charms you are going to get with each month quit...….
And I promise you will see all 12 charms Jillar
I was just thinking about you today, Lilly and I'm glad you are back !  You quit smoking tonight and this is great news !   I stayed away from alcohol for a few weeks, when I drank again no craves ever popped up.    They popped up other places having to do with ritual and habit but, drinking didn't summon smokes for me.       I absolutely LOVE what @c9jane29 said,   This﻿ time we commit to the quit! we embrace the quit!  we love ﻿the quit! This quit is the one that will save your life.﻿﻿
    Glad to see you back, and great you are sounding so  confident about your charm bracelet.
    Glad your back Lilly.  It shows your determination.  Everyday is a new day, so let this be your new beginning.  You can do this.

    I am glad your back... Coming back after a lost quit is the best way forward. Learn from last time and apply the lessons. So great to see you back in the saddle.
I feel absolutely disgusted at myself but I'm chain smoking, crying and feeling terrified.      I have had a sore in my mouth for weeks and I don't have my own teeth so at first thought that was the cause. I can feel it with my tongue and this morning it feels much bigger. I got the thought of it being cancer in my head and the thought has spiralled out of control. I can't tell anyone as it just doesn't seem right to scare everyone else. I have got doctors at 3.50 but my mind is just going into overdrive.      The stupidest part of all is I'm sobbing at the thought of cancer, but lighting up the very thing that causes it.       I'm sorry I'm just really scared and needed to talk to someone but this probably isn't the right place.
@Lilly, I hope you re-read that post and really really understand that your drug addiction has over-ridden your desire for survival.    "I don't want to die, but I'll keep drinking the poison"    You need to get educated about your addiction.  Yes, please, go to the Dr., get the medicine for your sore and maybe mention that you are a smoker and want to quit. Your Dr. could help deciding on NRT if that's what you need.   I will not take excuses, and no kid gloves right now; I tried nice. Early in my quit, I had to drive 7hrs (one way) to a pediatric cardiologist, stay in a hotel for 3-4 days at a time and drive back by myself...sometimes with 3 kids in tow. I did this for months! Had to watch my daughter go thru...hell. Hell for a 2yr old.    Never. Not. One. Time. Did I put a cigarette in my mouth. (Or her's)    That's why no excuse will work with me. The ONLY way you will EVER quit is to STOP putting the damn things in your mouth.   That's it. The end. NOPE.    Edited October 19, 2018 by c9jane29
    I completely understand addiction Jane which is why I said what I did about the fear but smoking at the same time.      I hope nobody else decides to take the kid gloves off because right now isn't the time to kick me.      If all people can see in that post is a relapse then I hope they will just walk away and not contribute. 
    Lilly.  I felt like you.  Smoking and knowing I would most likely get cancer.  Heck I smoked through breast cancer and radiation!  Now I am praying that I quit in time to avoid a horrible death.  How could I have been so stupid.  I was addicted and thought I could not live a life without cigs.  I tried smoking clinics and hypnosis and nothing helped until I landed here.  There is courage and support here and none of us are judging you.  We are hurting for you because we have all been there.  Together we have been able to shed the dreaded addiction.  While I was on vacation, I found myself looking at smokers as if they were aliens.  Never did I ever feel this was possible but it is.      Get yourself checked and we will go from there.  Know that I will be right there with you praying.  Together all things are possible.
    I'm not "kicking" you. I'm telling you the truth.   People are going to "contribute" things that you don't want to hear. Take it or leave it but I'm pretty passionate about helping people quit smoking so I'm not going to keep fluffing your butt.    I hate knowing that your addiction has activated enought "woe-is-me" areas of your brain that you lost a quit over night (twice that I know of)    I will stop posting on your thread here, but I beg you to continue learning about the changes nicotine makes in your brain; this is the only way you will build the defense to fight against it.     
    I spent the last few cigarettes with tears too....I knew something was not right with my feet / ank!es....i was right....   I was told STOP SMOKING NOW.....Lilly I did....and slowly I started healing...  You need to get checked out....throw the cigs down the toilet ....and commit to NOPE......  People are not  kicking you Lily ..they are being totally honest with you ...   Smoking will never make things better..only worse....    
    You fear smoking will kill you, and when you are afraid you smoke to calm your nerves.      I recommend that you step back and review.      Transcede this death-spiral or be claimed by it.        I'm not judging you, merely pointing out that this is where you stand.      You are at the edge where the winds of limbo roar.      I have faith that you can succeed.  That you have the resolve within you.       Crisis is the knife edge that can fuel your break through.      Have faith in yourself.     Focus on your goal.     Understand that the pain is transitory, but the freedom from addiction will last as long as you want it.        What we pay for most dearly we prize most highly.   You will look back and swear that quitting was the best decision you ever made.     ...and keep posting.  Win-lose-draw everyone on this train is rooting for you.      Never quit quitting.     
Lilly, Lilly, Lilly Either you want to quit or you want to smoke.   This is a simple choice and I hope you choose LIFE  but, I cannot choose for you nor, commit to your NOPE.  You must do the work and I know you can.    We quit and we are not special snowflakes.      This is no time for kid gloves, sugar.  This is your friggin' LIFE we are talking about.    Please get serious about your life and your health !    You have gotten a fearful physical wake up call....use it to your advantage. Use it to motivate your quit.      Hope your MD sorts you out right quick  and you begin to understand the damage you are doing to yourself by smoking and STOP causing yourself trauma and injury.        Quitting smoking is not that hard once you are educated and committed....and every day of freedom is glorious.      Do let us know you are OK, Lilly.  We worry.        Love,   Sazerac     p.s.   I am in full agreement with @c9jane29's thoughts and advice and really honored she told us a part of her amazing story.      Tough Love is real love and honest love just like the warm fluffy love.     It is all LOVE.         I have this advise  #1  Remember, We All Want To See You Have A Successful Quit.    #2  Take What You Need And Leave The Rest.  No one here wants to hurt you, we want to help you stop poisoning yourself.     S        Edited October 19, 2018 by Sazerac
I'm hoping you find its only a canker sore Lilly and use that as a wake up call. We just lost a friend to oral cancer. He was only 47 and he fought so hard to beat it that he had his teeth removed, parts of his jaw, cheeks and half his tongue before the drs told him there was nothing else they could do.    Chain smoking isn't going to make that bump any better, so it's time to put on your big girl panties and get back to your quit!Edited October 19, 2018 by jillarstupid auto correct
    Lily, what helped me with this quit was that  smoking would not solve the issue. It will not cure my headache, it will not pay debts, it will not amend relationship. Yes, for years we had a habit to smoke when things weren’t right, but they didn’t become right with smoking. I feel for you and hope you’re healthy, but smoking is not the way. 
    I'm sorry to hear about your relapse, Lilly.  Be careful with alcohol in the early days and weeks of a quit.        Smoking does not help anything.  It is all a lie.  You are much better off without cigarettes.  I hope you get back to your quit soon.  Yes, it is tough, but a smoke-free life is worth the early struggles and life as a smoker will only get worse and worse.
    Thanks for all the messages.        Just wanted to let you all know I do have a mass in my mouth but it certainly doesn't appear cancerous. She felt my neck and said my lymph nodes are fine whatever that means.      Just didn't want anyone worrying. 
That's the best news the doc could give. You must be so relieved, Lilly!        I have something for you. It's a message from someone you know very well.    'I have been dabbling with quitting since the nineties. My quits varied in length ie 10 minutes, 10 hours and now and again weeks. I threw the towel in on every quit I had because I just wasn't willing to endure a bit of discomfort. It was much easier to go and buy a packet of cigarettes than it was to feel "out of sorts."    I would provoke arguments at home so I could blame the other person for driving me back to smoking. I would get a flat tyre and be dancing at the roadside because nobody would expect me to keep my quit under such trying circumstances. I wanted to be a non smoker but at the same time I just couldn't let go.     If you find yourself in the same position then join the forum and ask for help. Reaching out to people who have already quit could be the missing piece of the jigsaw for you like it was for me. I did it a couple of days ago and am so grateful to everyone who took the time to encourage and share their hints, tips and recipes for success.      I found out today that when I smoked a cigarette I kind of did it on auto pilot.  I would think of a cigarette, light it, smoke it and put it out. Today I really concentrated on each cigarette and realised they don't taste great at all and I didn't enjoy any of them. The realisation that I actually was just an addict getting their fix was a bit of a revelation. I always disputed that theory and was adamant I loved smoking but now I know I was blinded by my addiction.     Read this site as much as you can because it really is a treasure chest of information. Set a quit date and stock up on plenty of quit food. You will get so caught up in the excitement of quitting here you will be desperate to start your own quit. As they say here you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.'     You wrote this a while ago. I wonder, what will be your next step?      I would like to give you faith and courage, but I can't. Yet, I am convinced you have it in you,  as we all do!                  Edited October 20, 2018 by MLMR
    Well we were worrying Lilly and I am so glad you let us know.  Please know you will have my continued prayers for your health and the ability to quit.      I know you can do it Lilly.  Let this be the scare that solidifies your quit.   Being uncomfortable for a period of about three weeks is nothing compared to the feeling of not smoking.  I had almost resolved myself to most likely dying of lung cancer.  My self esteem was so low I did not think I cared.  Now I feel like a different person.    C'mon girl let us do this together.
    Thanks everyone.        I will be back and I will quit. Just need to get my head back in the right place.       Jane don't stay away. I posted on a quit smoking forum that I was chain smoking. You took your kid gloves off not to kick me but to help me. After all it is a quit smoking site at the end of the day. I just wasn't seeing anything clearly yesterday. I hear you today. 
    If you want to heal your mouth as soon as possible, you will quit smoking.  Smoking only exacerbates the problem.   Please, Lilly.  Take care of yourself.
    I will Sazerac and sooner rather than later.        I have been referred to the hospital and they will do a biopsy which apparently they do as standard and not because the doctor was concerned.       I'm going to be fine but if I continue smoking I might not get a second chance.
21 minutes ago, Lilly said:             I'm﻿﻿ going to ﻿﻿be fine but if I continue smoking ﻿I might not get a second chance.            This should be your mantra when you start your quit again...because it is the raw truth.    Continue to read around here and whyquit.com while you find your quit.@Sazerac bumped this post in the Introductions page   There is so. much. POWER. in that thread! I realized after I quit that it's the people that want you to keep smoking (smoking friends, your addicted brain, and big tobacco) that say how devestatingly hard it is to quit. Harder than heroin!!    Lies. Lies. Lies.   Then you come here and it's just...not.     Keep finding that quit Lilly!!
    Lily....you have had  warning...    Look at this at a chance to quit...and stay quit....    I too was given a chance...and I took it....    The whole train is behind you...believe and love yourself ...as much as we do...    No time like the present ....to pledge a NOPE ....
    Lily, first, I am happy and relieved the changes aren’t cancerous.  Second, please, treat it as a wake up call. Smoking has done enough harm, don’t allow it do any more, please.    
^^^ I agree with Doreen (and others) Lilly! Take the plunge NOW! There's NEVER a perfect time to quit. There will always be sacrifice and unpleasantness involved in the early days no matter when you quit so ..... what are you waiting for. Just make that commitment to yourself NOW! Your "head space" will be thrown out of kilter anyway in the early part of your quit so don't wait for that perfect clarity of mind to quit. These are all excuses that your addicted brain is feeding you to prevent you from doing what's best for you. Just quit and we will all be here to support you every minute of the day and night when necessary.. I can tell you for certain, your future happiness depends on the path you choose now. Come on .... why not quit  Edited October 20, 2018 by reciprocity
    So glad to hear the doc isn't concerned about it being cancer just wish you hadn't of given up that day you had quit. NOW I have to wait even longer to see that first month charm   P.S. I keep bringing up the charm bracelet because I LOVE the idea and wish I had of thought of that lol. Seriously though, you have to be ready to quit in order to succeed so when you're truly ready we will be here  
@Lilly  Get your head back in the game. There is no perfect time to quit like mentioned, my last cigg was the 24th in 2015 two days before Thanksgiving .
    You have been given great news, be thankful and quit today, you never know if continued smoking may cause something to change again!,!! Give yourself the best gift and quit today and start collecting those charms.   All the best.
    Lilly, the train says hi!! Hope you haven't given up on your quit! Please give yourself this gift...it will change your life.   Don't give up on yourself!! YOU ARE WORTH IT!
    You know too much now, Lilly, to ever be an obedient slave again.   Smoking has been ruined for you and will never be the comfort it once was.  You know too much.      Soon,  you will defeat your addiction.  Why not ?
Cravings are the most feared in a quit and we all know they can be uncomfortable. It's this fear that keeps many of us from even attempting to quit smoking. The fear of being uncomfortable.  We feel this way even though we know that smoking related disease is probably not terribly comfortable either.....addiction is so not rational.... The addiction wants to manipulate you into believing that there is no way you could ever survive quitting.  No way you could ever get through a minute, hour or day feeling like you want to smoke and not give in.   Seriously.....Pffft.  We're tougher than that.  It's all just hype designed to keep you smoking.  A crave is not a command to smoke.  Just because you feel it, does not mean you need to act on it.  Acknowledge it and move on.  As time goes on, those craves will fade away and in it's place will be a person who stood up and took control of their life.  There is no greater feeling than that.  No greater feeling.
The craves! The craves are the signal that you have triumphed over the addiction. The crave comes because you have refused to smoke. You ignore it and it goes away. It comes less and less. Welcome the crave - it means you are getting it done.
This was the first time I ever tried to quit. I did not know what to expect. I used to joke that I would need to be hidden away for awhile so I would not scream and rant.  When I did quit, I went about my life as it was before. I was not in the bedt of moods but I did not turn into domething I could not control.  It sucked but it was foable and worth it to be done with smoking. 
I crave lifeSmoking sucks
In the beginning I tried to watch a lot if videos about smoking, and smoking related diseases... That made it easier to tell myself to 'man-up' when I got a crave - what is worse; 3 minutes of mild discomfort every so often, or a (shortened) lifetime of misery from a terminal disease caused by smoking...?!  No contest!
I have had some craves, holiday triggers. I chose nope, sadly my mum chose a now second deck of cigs. My informed choice was not difficult. A crave is simply an auto pilot response and you always have the choice to say yes or no. 
Craves are just thoughts....When ever I have a crave....I try and turn a negative in to a positive....I'm feeling like this at the moment..because I'm ridding myself of a poison...repairing my poor neglected lungs....As time goes on ...the craves get lesser and weaker.....
nobody every died from a crave plenty die as a result of giving into that crave...over and over again.  great post miss jenny jenn! :)
Fear has a lot to answer for, before I quit it's the one thing that stopped me from jumping on a quit sooner, fear that i just won't be able to do it, the reason more people are not quit is not because they can't it's because they won't, fear is holding them back Don't be afraid nothing to fear but fear itself
Fear is what prevented me from quitting for so long.   Once I faced the fear, it became ridiculously easy.
I didn't fear quitting....frankly, I rarely, if ever, thought about quitting.   Then I quit and took a day at a time as usual.      I didn't fear craves    they were a minor annoyance.  OK they were a horrible annoyance for a while.        I didn't fear relapse.  If my quit didn't stick, I would quit again or not.     Fear didn't figure into my equation.    I have fears just like everybody but, not about quitting or staying quit.       I was riding on quitting on a whim....let's quit for a year and see what it feels like. You can always go back to smoking.Edited September 20, 2018 by Sazeracclarity
I would guess that the overwhelming reason that most people don't attempt or delay quitting smoking is out of fear.  They fear that withdrawal is unbearable.  They fear how hard it is because others told them it was.  They're afraid because they think they'll be unable to cope with stress, enjoy alcohol, a meal, a night out with friends, morning coffee and the biggest one, the fear of ditching a familiar friend.  Of course we all know that these are all lies but until the lies are exposed and you experience how much better life is after quitting, these fears stop a lot of people from taking the plunge. The Fear Of SuccessThis video explains how many people are fearful of attempting a quit because they realize that they may actually succeed. The attached videos examine the reasons for this fear and will help smokers to understand that the fears they have of their lives being ruined are based on the false assumption that cigarettes were helping them to live as opposed to recognizing that smoking was ruining their lives in many ways. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHhWSOsWoBE&list=PLCDB8BA311D538113&index=9Related videos:Resources explaining interaction between nicotine and stresshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHbpX...Quitting smoking can make you calmer, happier and healthierhttp://youtu.be/7K038NtxO6o"I'll never be as productive again if I quit smoking"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8awQ... The Fear Of RelapsingVideo explains how many people are fearful of even attempting a quit because they are convinced that even if by some miracle they succeed, they will likely lose the quit at some future point in time.

That is awesome MQ!   Something I had not thought of is the fear I would succeed and then how could I go on without my "best friend".   Arghhh.  So happy to not be living that life anymore.
for me...it was all about FEAR  Fear that my life wouldn't be complete without my "friend"Fear that I will never stop cravingFear that I would fail...for the umpteenth timeFear that i wasn't strong enough all fear based I even feared that if I quit....then I would get cancer cause I shocked my body...so silly
I knew I wasn't looking deep enough.    I wasn't skeered until my last hurdle ! Look what I found in my blog,    "Now, at Ten months and change,    craves are strange little thought bubbles that don't belong to me,  EXCEPT  when I try to paint.    That is what I 'do' and it is being a real bugger.What if I can't paint without that junk ? It feels so weird to hold a brush without a smoke.  Plenty of Fear (oh, JOY) to shut down   on this last (or current) no-smoking snafu. I will buck up, quit my special snowflake whining and just get on with it FGS.  This week, I will.  Yep, this week."     and with encouragement from y'all,that week passed and by three weeks fear was a distant memory.Amazing how quickly I forgot !Love that.S   (edited to add)If I hadn't been able to jump that hurdleI would have gone back to smokingbut, by that time it was just breaking a silly habit and the my quit had a life of it's own.Edited September 20, 2018 by Sazeracpunctuation
I was scared to quit, but terrified not to.  Scared to fail-but even more afraid to succeed as I thought that would mean I would be unhappy forever.Everything used to be scary when I was a smoker. I am so glad I was wrong on so many counts.
Bump
 A crave is not a command to smoke.  Just because you feel it, does not mean you need to act on it.  Acknowledge it and move on.   Realizing this made all the difference in my quit.  I stopped fighting and won the battle.  Since then it has been, to borrow a phrase, easy peasy.
    bump
    I've never liked the word "craving" when I quit. To me, a craving means something I want...I did NOT want to smoke. They were only memories. My dying addiction reminding(begging) me that I used to smoke at certian times.    Just NOPE and find something else to do.     
    Is two cheeseburgers, a chicken and bacon sandwich, two ham and cheese toasties, a hunk of cheese, half a glass of wine and a gin and tonic going a bit overboard on the old diet front? Good job I don't have any chocolate. 
    Lol...sounds good to me...what's for afters...
    I've come to bed with a cuppa Doreen, safer when I'm further away from the kitchen. 
    Not if you're hungry! Did you ever suck the jelly out of a jelly doughnut and then fill it with chocolate swirl ice cream?
    No whispers, but now you've given me ideas
    Nah, sounds good to me  ...I couldn't have done it without chocolate tho!!
    Sounds good to me too!  
    It sounds good to me Pumpkin. You've made me hungry.
    Butter popcorn and jelly donut holes have become my comfort foods.  I am even starting to feel the pouch getting bigger.   Quitting smoking and gaining weight really bothered me before.   Now I figured,  if I could give up smoking, I can certainly give up food too.  So I am going to savor it now while I make my quit stronger and then contend with it later!
    Pumpkin, no one is mad at you for enjoying those things.    It appears you have been studying the typical American diet and decided to try it. Awesome      You are doing better than me though - I cannot live without chocolate.
     
On Oct 6 2017 I quit cold turkey. No gum, no patches, vape, weed, pills, nothing.       I had no idea I would still be quit. I remember thinking, "If I make it even a month..."    I mean honestly, who really thinks they will be able to stick with it? it is scary to think of life deprived of tobacco. Like "Damn, so I just do not get to smoke anymore?" Plus all the propaganda about how hard it is to quit, how you NEED NRT, etc. Bullshit. You know what kept me from using NRT? I was not able to afford it at the time PLUS I am too much a cheap skate to pay for something I can do for free.      I never picked up vape because whenever i saw people do it, it looked stupid. Worse than someone carrying a chew-spit bottle, worse than someone smoking a cigarette. I do not like to look stupid.     it does not seem like my daily life is different until i remember things like -     My cigarette break at work is now a hot chocolate break. I don't like coffee. One time at work we ran out of hot chocolate. I am not sure how I survived.   None of my clothes in the past year were ruined because of cigarette cherries randomly falling apart (happens a lot with roll-your-own's, even in a good machine)   My room and house do not smell like a disgusting ash tray. PLUS it is one less fire hazard. I do not feel like I am going to puke half the time. Looking back, cigarettes tasted like crap. It is like one imagines it will be some wonderful sensation but in reality, it was nasty.   No more nasty-ass yellowish film all over everything. Soon after i quit, i took some wall pictures down to clean them and the rags went from white to nasty yellow. No more time wasted sitting there cranking out cigarettes with the top-o-matic machine. Had to make sure I had enough.      But like also my blood pressure has decreased a little since quitting. Doctors say my lungs sound perfect. I can laugh like hell and not have a coughing fit. MY GYOD that was embarrassing to try to laugh and be like "BLAH HACK CHOKE COUGH HACK HOCK WHOAT GURGLE SPAT..." Or trying to fall asleep but being awoken cause my lungs would rattle.  Take a deep breath? For-get it.      How the hell did I not die of smoking? I was one of those who thought smoking was a big joke. I used to call it things like "Having lung sex" or "going out for a roast" or "going out to choke on carbon monoxide" or "ensuring an early grave" or "sexing up the air".        But I thought, "What if I DO die early from this shit? Who will take my place as the forum troll on web places I visit? Where will my room mate live? Who will keep Goodwill in business? Who will keep Pepsico in business? Who will the general public laugh at? They are all depending on me!" I knew it was time to quit.       Now when I see someone smoking, I want to say, "What the heck are you doing? That is nasty!"        Honestly, there are still moments I think I would like one but I do not need that pile of crap back in my life. It's just gross.Edited October 20, 2018 by Jet Black
    BAMMM!  @Jet Black thanks for this hopefull, no-nonsense and honest post.       I love to read these stories. All different approaches, various attitudes towards quitting/methods/life in general. But with one obvious thing in common: proof that quitting smoking is doable AND desirable!      Thanks again             
    A Great post JB....very inspirational to newbies and lurkers....Thanks for posting ...x
    Good for you Jet Black!!    I don't miss the rasping choking laugh either!! Or coughing the large black loogies in the morning.  Man, hindsight on smoking is a kick in the pants...    I'm glad you're free and loving it!
Love this post JB. That 3rd month can be a kicker but you made it through.... and your going to KTQ because you are never going back do do that again.
I mean, it's a saying and all so it must be true. Anywho, I have been smoke free for 8 days now. No excuses, just failed. Missed you all though. Ok. So here's to my final quit.... I hope...
    Hey Girleen,    Welcome home.       A successful quit takes more than 'hope'    but, all that is required your personal commitment to NOPE. This is all, a commitment to NOPE and you cannot fail.      we're here to help you in any way we can    so, stay close to the board and teach yourself again about your nicotine addiction.      
Hi I Got This, congrats on 8 days quit. Take hope out of the equation and let's do this!

    Welcome back. No Hope - Just Nope..... You can do this. So this, which I consider my sticky quit is the the third time I've passed the one week mark.... third's the charm in my case.... it worked for me, lets make it work for you.      You now how important nope is.... you can do this sweetie.... fluids, blood sugar, distraction... you can do this.
Hey stranger    Hell yeah - get 'er done this time. You know the drill. Learn from your mistakes and don't repeat them. You'll be golden  8 days is a great start - almost a week
    Thanks all!! I feel stronger this time around. I'm rolling with it and all the ups and downs. Something feels different this time. This time I'm not so comfortable and gung ho in my quit... I feel I'm constantly walking on egg shells. But in a way it's a good thing.... I'm constantly reminding myself not to smoke.... that I don't smoke.... so far, little by little it's working.
    Welcome (T)!! I've seen your face around and wondered what's up! (If you haven't been to stick of the day in a while...well, I'm sorry) You know the drill tho! Just have to keep on those junkie thoughts...hope to see you around the board!
    Good to see you back.....   Same rules....read all you can ...watch all Joel's videos....knowledge....  And ....Never stick anything in your mouth.... And set it on fire...    Let's make this your sticky quit ..
    Be sure to start reading all the great info. available on this site again. Truly understanding that this addiction is your enemy and not your friend is key to a long term quit. See the addiction for what it is - a killer!
    You’re the active part of the quit, it’s not about hoping and trying  there are many myths around smoking but you’ll see, you’re stronger than you think and you’ll get even stronger with each crave you beat.

I hope...               Don't hope that it is your final quit.  Make it your final quit.        As you know, there is a lot of support here to help you quit for good.  Make the commitment, fight through the craves, and seek help here if needed.        I went through numerous short quits before quitting for good.  That cycle of quitting and relapsing really sucks.  Quit for good and you don't have to go through this again.       Congratulations on 8 smoke free days.  Keep up the great work.  You can quit for good this time.
    I remember one of your quits was either the day before or the day after mine. We talked briefly about it, something about having seats right next to each other on the Quit Train.  You were one of the first people I remember seeing on here. You, Reci, Bakon, Doreen, couple others.        You mentioned in this thread about not feeling so comfortable and gung ho about this quit. I will tell you a little secret - My first few days I thought the same thing, "If I can stay quit, if I make it an entire month..." Things were easy for the first couple months but just about the three month mark, it was hell. I have NO clue why it took so long for the big battle to hit.     I was actually kind of surprised when you quit showing up here, supposedly relapsed. We quit about the same time and you were part of my inspiration to stay quit. It had been a few weeks and I thought, "Other people like this lady quit about the same time I did, so if she can do it, so can I." that might sound weird but it was honestly one of the things that helped my early days.      Because you helped me (whether you realized it or not) I need to ask - is there anything I can say or do that might give you some help?     My personal opinion is that if you made it an entire week, you can do this long haul. Nothing is as bad as the first few days. Well, you got past those so things are going well.
Your 1st. class seat next to JB...is still empty waiting for you....    Sounds like you two...need to travel together....   Buckle up  T.....there may be curves and bumps in the track...but hold tight .you can  do it too...
    Just a quick note to say,  still here, still quit... good days,  bad days but no smoking.   I get here to read quick and get inspiration not much time to comment though... sorry
    Hello Parsley!! Glad all is well! Reward for you!
    Celebrate every day, Parsley !  You are smoke free, yay yay yay.
    Thanks for checking in parsley, you're doing great! 
    Keep strong! You’re doing great! 
    Pretty happy! Many more good days than bad, and now most bad days are really only a few hours.  Really going to be appreciative when the cold hits and I am not out in the freezing temps and wind and snow!!   Happy! Just sayin'
    So here I am, entering day three. Doing ok, only problem is insomnia, which I know is common. Hadn't been sleeping great as it was, so add quitting smoking to the equation and it's a nightmare. Think I had about three hours last night, and four the night before. It's really getting me down. I'm not drinking more caffeine than usual (i drink decaf anyway) nor am I eating loads of sugar. I know it will pass eventually but with everything else going on I need my sleep. Am even debating going to see my doctor .        Anyway, just wanted to have a good moan and feel sorry for myself.      xxx
I got sleeping tablets from my Doctor to help me with that... it really only lasted the first few weeks... I know some people advocate taking the night time cold and flu tablets you can get from the chemist. Only do this if you know you can take them and they wont affect any other medication you might have.        Day 3 is great Pumpkin... well its not its kinda cruddy... but the fact you are still smoke free, that is great. You are getting through the tough part now.
Congratulations on moving to day 3 Pumpkin. Two valuable days in the bag already. The insomnia of the very early stages of quitting is a pain if you experience it. In common with others though around the 2 week mark I started to get the best sleeps I'd had in years.      I was going to suggest cutting down on caffeine as the received wisdom is that you need to half consumption early in a quit, but starting from zero you really have nowhere else to go on that front.       Don't be afraid to ask the doctor for help, I'm certain it won't be the first time they have been asked for assistance in this.         You are doing great, celebrate and keep it going.
    Sorry to hear you're having sleep issues. That really does wear thin pretty quickly. Hope you find a solution to it soon and get some much needed rest. Some of the quit symptoms we have to go through in the early days are certainly annoying but in the end, well worth it considering the benefits you will gain. Freedom from this addiction does not come easily but it is there for all who are strong enough to pay their dues. Fight on Pumpkin! You'll get there  
I agree..having little sleep sucks....in my early quit I was here 24/7....  It does pass...at different rates for each person....   Day 3...all the nicotine has left your body now sweetheart....that's got to be good....
    Thank you all.  Its nice to have you all here.  I'm sitting here at my PC trying to translate this document (about a campsite!) and my eyes are just wanting to close.  I also keep getting a bit lightheaded.  I also remember this from the last time.        I have always been anti-nap in the daytime, but am thinking it might be good for me today.  Then again, maybe I should tough it out.  Stupid thing is I am tired when I go to bed, then as soon as the light goes out, my legs get restless and then I can't sleep, so then I get anxious, then I cry, and then I just get more and more frustrated.        Aaaaghhh!        
    Aww P ...   I would say have a little nap...it will help recharge your batteries.. Be kind to yourself x
    Thanks Doreen       I may also force myself to go for a very short walk by the river.  Hell, I may even do some yoga this evening before bed.    
    Yes. Try anything and everything to get into a new mindset. You never know what might work to relax you a little more.
Good to know your still here!  And... moan all you want.     I had sleep issues as well. It lasted for about 2,5 weeks (but starting after the first week, where I actually slept like a beast). I really hope you'll find something that works for you, to help you through this period. Take care! Edited October 18, 2018 by MLMR
Oh, the sleep! How I missed it! I couldn't force it and standard OTC pills made me...weird: sick, brain fog, worse than quitting did. I just rode it out and would take a couple of 2hr naps at night if that's what it took.   You will find your groove Pumpkin! ETQ!
    Hello Pumpkin,  Sleep when you are tired, rest when you are tired even if you cannot sleep. Do some meditation, actually do a lot of meditation.    Try to relax yourself.  No screens, darkened room, get as comfortable as you can and breathe slow and deep, slower and deeper.  This will help your tissues repair even if you don't sleep.     Congratulations on your quit.   Three days is spectacular and you never have to go through this ever again. Stay close to the board and NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE
    So I took a lunch break, went for a walk by the river, and popped in to see a friend.  Hope you like a picture. 
    Love this! The misty reflection on the water is fabulous  Great shot P!
    Love the pic pumpkin, you're doing great  And I agree that maybe you should try to take a nap during the day, at least until the insomnia passes
    You’re doing great. Lack of sleep is one of the nastiest parts of an early quit, I wish it’s back to normal soon! 
    Slept a little better last night. Today was my volunteer afternoon at the animal refuge. Animals always put things into perspective.
    Animals love is a great release of dopamine and serotonin!  Congrats on a new day as a non-smoker Pumpkin! 
    Two Happy Non-Smokers sharing time together ..... love it!
    Well as far as I know Linsie doesn't smoke!
    Happy to see you happy and smoke free !
    You’re awesome! Keep on rocking! 
    Great to see that you are doing so well in your quit, Pumpkin!  Keep up the great work!
    I am having a moment where I feel I have some sort of "control" over my cigarette addiction. Not a lot, but some.
    That's a good thing  Remember that feeling because it will become your new normal the longer you stay quit!      Don't be disappointed if it fades suddenly. That's just part of the process of getting back to normal. Your addiction will try and make you feel insecure still in the hopes you will light one up again. You won't though because you're smoke-free now    That feeling of control, will revisit you more often now as you continue to NOPE!
    Everyday a little progress!     Education and mindset were a big part of gaining control for me. The more educated I became about my addiction, the more I understood the head games of addiction and could confront junkie thoughts head on instead of cowering.   It's a good feeling, take pride, stand on your front porch and scream to the world "I QUIT SMOKING!" because that's how good you should feel!!

    That's awesome Christine, hopefully each day will get better and better  
    It only gets better!
    There’ll come a day when non-smoking is just obvious. You’ll love it 
    I get "hypnogogic jerks" that jolt me awake every time i start to fall asleep. this happens multiple times a night. like a dozen times or more. this has happened all night for the past two nights (of my quit). i have gotten these jolts before randomely, but this is really intense and just seems to get like this when i try to quit. my psychiatrist doesn't seem overly concerned about it. But it is driving me nuts, and i want to sleep.        anyone else have to deal with this?
    Insomnia is a normal part of quitting Christine and if your psychiatrist isn't concerned about it than it's probably just how your body deals. I used an OTC sleep aid, one pill a couple times a week in the beginning just to help my body relax and get some sleep. You may want to ask your dr about doing the same.
I had to get prescription sleeping pills because I had insomnia to start with... so once I quit it was down to 2-4hrs a night... and yep those hypnogogic jerks have been a part of my life forever. It got better.
    I was always a deep sleeper so insomnia after quitting was a shock. It never returned to the previous state, I wake up almost every night. It got truly bad since I moved to this country. 
    about quitting
    Comitting
    ^^that!^^
    I'm not sure i would even know how that feels.      this is like my ninth or tenth attempt. I'm not even sure

I'm not even sure           I was there, blown 2 1/2 year quit and over 10 failed attempts. I'd go go weeks sometimes a few months and blow it. Just saying NO and or replacing smoking with something else. It becomes our crutch when we get triggered, just re-learn how to handle situations without the cigg. NOPE ... Not One Puff Ever is clever and works . You can do it, you just gotta wanna do it

There is something, maybe something here, in Allan Carr videos, on google, a mantra...something will click @christine 12 and it will be your "ta-da" moment.   Mine was a very wise man on a quit smoking forum told me the "only way I'd ever quit smoking is to stop putting cigarettes in my mouth" --duh.  You just keep trying. What is smoking doing for you? Education is important because the only answer is killing you.

You need to re-commit each and every day for quite some time in order to get through and establish a really solid quit.     You can't just wish you could quit. You've gotta REALLY WANT to quit and for an extended period of time.
Wait, didn't we just celebrate your one month smoke free @christine 12?

That's a bummer Christine but when you're truly ready to quit you'll do anything you can to protect each and every day you have smoke free. I stayed close to home the first month or two and only ventured out if my never smoked husband went with me because I didn't trust myself not to cave to a crave. I also was glued 24/7 to my forum, posted a couple SOS's even though my vanity didn't let me actually put SOS in the title. I made sure though to word it so members knew I needed some support and they were there for me.   So when you're truly ready to quit, we'll be there for you too.  So my final answer to what is the hardest part of quitting? It's deciding that you're ready.
    As has been said many times; you just have to want to quit MORE than you want to smoke. And not for just a day or two!
    Comitting is one thing, accepting and embracing everything that comes with it is a second. For me that's the hard part. If I 'just' commit, I become hardened and  solely do it to prove myself that I'm not a ... loser. I don't want to do it like that anymore. After eight weeks (!!!) I find that's its less and less about not smoking, but merely to do things differently. And I love that because I know what I learn now, is for life 
    Looking at the previous quits and this one, I think for me the most difficult part was to change the attitude to smoking. Previously I was feeling and acting as if I was losing something, this time it seems a more conscious decision. That change of mindset was the recipe for success in my case.
    I'm with ela there is wanting freedom and to be quit and there is giving something up and loosing something..... this quit is different because I haven't lost a mate I've freed myself from a prison... that attitude switch from what I was loosing to all I am gaining made a huge difference.... and being present, in your face... everyone saw me quit... everyone read all about it.... I was accountable to them... it was all out there for the world to see.... a lot easier to keep hold of, especially early one, when I was declaring to all and sundry here I am, I have quit... I don't smoke anymore.
    Once you understand the whole cycle of smoking ...and the lies that we are led to believe....   Helps us relax....bla   Helps us calm down ...bla   It's our reward ..bla....bla......bla.....ect.....  Quitting becomes much easier....    This is why reading all you can about this horrible addiction...is the best weapon you can have....you fight it with knowledge...
    Please do not be hard on yourself because a quit will never work if it comes from a dark place. I live around a few cronic quitters and it seems defeating and exausting but...everyone makes their own choices, you know?  You have to change your mindset and figure out what hole smoking is filling up for you. (Most smokers are trying to fill depression/ anxiety) and fill it in another way. You have to separate your quit from all of that.  Your quit is your baby so no matter how you *feel*: you don't feed a baby cigarettes.    
The hardest part, for me, was accepting that I was a Drug Addict.  A veritable JUNKIE.Once I made that leap, I could no longer find comfort in Denial and truth became my motivator.Education led me to acceptance and a commitment to NOPE (as in, Not One Puff EVER NEVER EVER)    Once I copped to being a bona fide nicotine addict and continued my unremitting education about smoking and nicotine addiction,    I became a ferocious NOPE-er and everything got easier.  See 'what is the easiest part...'
Pretty simple - the hardest part of quitting for me was fighting off craves.        I never felt guilt or shame about smoking.  I just got tired of the mess involved like the smell and it was just gross. That and i figured If I wanted to avoid health problems... After age 40 isn't the best time in life to play games with your health.     I guess what helped me hang on to the quit was focusing on the things I didn't like about smoking. I didn't want to spend the money, didn't want to ruin outfits with the smell, didn't want to clean up cigarette butts and ashes.     I do not know your living situation but one thing that might help is avoiding temptation. If you do not live with smokers then that should be easy - just do NOT have any tobacco in the house. Toss the ash trays. Do whatever practical to not remind yourself of smoking. I would say toss the lighters but sometimes those come in handy as they are more of a tool than a smoking thing. But if you must toss them for the time being, if it helps then yeah. Clean up as much evidence of smoking as you can. Like emptying the car ash tray, launder curtains and beddings, maybe all clothes.       If you live with a smoker - try to make whatever arrangements necessary. Maybe they go outside to smoke, maybe they hide their cigarettes from you, whatever.       For me when I quit, i basically had to get it completely out of my life. It was a cleaning project. My room mate does not smoke so that helped.
Three weeks ago, our youngest Corgi, Callum fell ill and we had to rush him to the emergency vet. Turns out he has IHMA, a disease that makes his immune system mistakenly produce antibodies that attack his own red blood cells.  Long story short, he almost died, got a transfusion and now, three weeks (and about $6,000) later, he's on the mend.    All the while, my 14 old boy Tex, has been battling eye disease for about 1.5 years now and is on his last leg. We don't have much time left with him and that's killing me.        In the midst of all this, our other senior Corgi, Ginger had a seizure last Thursday and we had to put her down. There was no saving her...     Needless to say, things have been hard around here and we're struggling to cope, but if I had to find a silver lining, it's that I never -not once- even thought about smoking.     It never even crossed my mind, and if I can deal with all this, I can deal with anything. Smoke Free.       RIP Ginger      NOPE!
    Sorry for your loss Jim.    It's great you have the pride of your freedom from bowing to your addiction to look to for comfort. I know the feeling as I too went through some stressful times this summer and never even considered lighting one up   It's great to reach that point in your quit!
    I'm so sorry, they are family and going through that is tough i imagine. Glad you ddint even think of smoking.          RIP Ginger
    Oh Jim I'm so sorry, our pets are our kids so I know the pain of losing them

Oh, Jim, I am so very, very sorry for all your pain and loss.  We had to say goodbye to our 18 year old Rory a month ago, and my heart is still breaking, and I cry each time I come in our home.  Lots of love, prayers, and understanding coming your way.  And, like you, the good news is that smoking never crossed my mind.
I'm so sorry to hear this, Jim.  It is good that you never thought about smoking but I feel bad for all that you are going through.Edited October 18, 2018 by johnny5
    Any loss is hard and as Jillar said our pets are our fur babies. I am sorry for your loss and the worry of your other two boys.  @Nancy sorry you lost your Rory as well... :hugs 
    I am sorry for your loss    and v. inspired that you have kept your quit.   Be especially kind to yourself right now.
    I am so sorry Jim.  I know your pain.  We lost both our Golden Retrievers within months of each other.  They are more than our pets.  We love them like our children.  Each and every one leave those prints on our hearts.  I hope your young one is finally on the mend and your senior leaves you with many more special moments.  
My condolences, Jim, on the loss of your beautiful corgi, Ginger.....treasure the memories. Sorry to hear your other two furbabies are having issues. Hopefully both will pull through to give you many more memories! It is a lot of heartache to deal with at one time....glad your quit held up successfully!!!   Edited October 18, 2018 by Rozuki
    My condolences, I am terribly sorry for your loss.

    I'm so sad and so sorry for your loss. I  feel your pain as I lost one of my dearly loved fur babies back in March this year.   Thinking of you .
    Prayers.... I'm very sorry to hear of the sad loss of your  fur babies.....they are with us for only a short time ,but ...leave memories that last a lifetime .....
